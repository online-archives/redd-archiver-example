    <div class="md"><p>My code was eventually taken by competent programmers and converted to C++. In fact, they took away my commit privs on my own code. </p>
<p>It was for the best, as I'm particularly horrible at it. I've worked with great programmers, thankfully. I can hack something out but you don't want it in production. I also used to code while drinking, often heavily, and would comment EVERYTHING. I'm not kidding, I mean everything. I have had more lines of comments than of code.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I'm retired. The scary thing is, my code has probably impacted your life. I modeled traffic and eventually also modeled pedestrian traffic. Yup... Fortunately, I hired professionals as soon as it was fiscally viable.</p></div>

<p>I know the guy who wrote the original printer drivers. I guess some of the code is still in use. These were the old teletype printers, before monitors. I should say he wrote drivers and helped author the spec. I know loads of people!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kids! LOL There's plenty of room on my lawn, but it's cold and there's wine indoors.</p>
<p>I turn 60 at the end of this month. Yeah, you'd have been there for some great computing years. </p>
<p>I actually hated computers but I was obligated to use them. I used them when they were useless unless you were a programmer. My first exposure was in 1971 on the HP 9100. A few years later, we'd have a mainframe connection to Dartmouth. That was high school. I went to a snooty prep school/boarding school. My next exposure would be in the late seventies. Then, I'd have a TRS 80 and it just goes on from there. At one point, my computer was more expensive than my new car, with all the peripherals. </p>
<p>I hated them. We made our peace in about 2002, about five years before I retired. I worked on some pretty big iron and, truthfully, it sucked for the longest time. I was a DEC shop until Sun bought them and I stuck with Sun and some HP stuff, more or less. We were clustering pretty early on, so we could be agnostic bit I was most happy with the products, price, and support from those three.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You should like this...</p>
<p>I paid $100/MB for RAM. I once had to solder 'memory chips' so that I had enough memory to write lowercase letters. I have more compute power, flops, in my house than I had in a whole data center with piped cooling, a network closet, and a half-dozen people working in it. I have more storage space, in just my laptop, than would have been fiscally viable in the year 1999 and would have been a seven digit figure even if I could have figured out a way to make it fit.</p>
<p>I can remember our trade secret was that we had burst the TB of data sets, before Walmart had. It was a series of disk arrays that ran through a cluster of early Sun blade servers. It was state of the art and the total insurance value was well into the seven digit area, just for the hardware. </p>
<p>I have more compute power than that on my desk. I might have more than that on my tablet.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep on seeing these changes in C++, but so far most of the features are basically useless and makes C++ even more confusing to use.</p>
<p>An all I wanted is to have a clear error when I made a typing mistake. I still need a day of reading the compiler errors logged to discover that I somehow forgot a simple ';' somewhere out there.</p></div>
