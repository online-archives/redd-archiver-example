I have the program written already and if I were to submit it I'd surely get a decent grade, but it's not due until Sunday so I started messing around.</p>
<p>I wrote a segment that instead of statically printing the header will do so dynamically based on the number of columns defined by a constant.  The problem I'm running into is that it works for only about half the numbers in our given range (1-50).  What's really odd is the range is defining the number of rows, not columns.  It seems to be putting a random number, or asterisk, or parentheses between the N and the ^; or sometimes just dropping the N entirely.  Here is the segment of code I have as it stands, any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!:</p>
<pre><code>const int MAX_COLUMNS = 4;
char notation = 'N';
</code></pre>
<pre><code> for (int col = 0; col &lt; MAX_COLUMNS; col++) {
            if (col == 0) {
                printf(&quot;%s%11c&quot;, &amp;notation, ' ');
            } else {
                printf(&quot;%s^%i%9c&quot;, &amp;notation, col + 1, ' ');
            }
        }
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In languages I know, %s is for null-terminated strings. Notation is a char, not a null-terminated string.  Try %c instead of %s when printing chars (and drop the &amp;)?</p>
<p>Edit: that is almost certainly the problem. In the &quot;50&quot; example, it's printing &quot;N2&quot;, because 50 happens to be the ASCII code for the character &quot;2&quot;.  In the &quot;8&quot; example, it appears to print nothing because 8 is the ASCII code for backspace (so, it prints the &quot;N&quot;, and then moves the cursor back one space; when it prints the ^, the N gets overwritten).</p>
<p>I bet if you choose 65, you'll see &quot;NA&quot;, &quot;NA^2&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p>Under the hood, your printf is printing whatever it finds in memory starting from the address you gave it, until it finds a byte with value &quot;0&quot;.  It just so happens that MAX_COLUMNS is located there, so the bytes that make up MAX_COLUMNS get printed as if they were part of the string.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, that was it.  I couldn't figure out what it was complaining about and this was the fix.  Dropped the &amp; and changed to %c (I had %c and &amp;notation there previously which Xcode complained about).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In your print statements, why did you use %s for a char and then pass a pointer? This seems like the most likely cause to me. Maybe try
<code>printf(&quot;%c%11c&quot;, notation, ' ');</code></p>
<p>I think that should work. <s>I think what is happening is you are giving printf the address to a char which gets represented as an int, so effectively you are passing an int to be printed as a string. I could be wrong about that though.</s> EDIT: Yeah, I was wrong. Thanks to <a href="/user/taxation_is_slavery">/u/taxation_is_slavery</a> for pointing this out below.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'd also like to add that you could even do something like:
<code>printf(&quot;%11c&quot;, notation);</code>
Although it might mess with the spacing, you might need to increment that value or something but it eliminates the need to pass the space char into the function to get it to space out. There is a width and a length flag and I'm not sure which is being used instead of which in this case, but I do know it's shorter and more efficient.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually he was giving the address of that char, but %s format expects null terminated strings, not just a single char, so printf continued until it hit a zero byte somewhere in the memory space after it.</p></div>
