    <div class="md"><p>No, it is a money scam. </p>
<p>Good developers are self educating, they do not need bootcamps. Bootcamps will cripple your creativity because they will show how all the other code monkeys are doing it. Without realizing it you have become yet another code monkey that can be easily replaced.</p>
<p>The best way is to get a compiler and try it yourself, figure everything out and especially create stuff that no one else have thought about. Use that money to buy computer stuff,  books, software,.... This is the hard way, incredibly hard and frustrating way, but it forces your brain to find solutions that no one knows. </p>
<p>Bootcamps are like drugs, you become depended on them to keep your job. You need to educate every year to keep your knowledge. </p>
<p>Companies that likes bootcamp developers will use you as some throw-aways object a few years later on. You became too expensive so they get a new kid just from bootcamp that has the same knowledge as you have.</p></div>

<p>A variety of free coding courses with certificates available. You pay for them by doing projects for charities. There's also codeacademy, w3schools, cousera, udemy... Honestly there's so many free resources available to learn coding nowadays it's really not worth it. And even if you insist on doing a paid course, you can get more bang for your buck elsewhere.</p></div>
