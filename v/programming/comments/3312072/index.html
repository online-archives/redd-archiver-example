    <div class="md"><p>Back in the 80s we thought we were waking the world up to how much they were duped.</p>
<p>Since that time it has become abundantly clear that isn't ever going to happen.  People don't want to know the truth, truth is depressing.</p>
<p>Couple with that all the hacks that exposed criminal activities but nothing ever happened to the criminals.  What's the point?  Public doesn't care which means those in power have nothing to fear (at least from the public).</p>
<p>Working on other things now that are much more difficult and actually legal.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Because most hacking is opportunistic. You find a vulnerability in a piece of server software, and see what people you can find with that vulnerability. You can just pick a target like Facebook and have a good chance of finding a vulnerability there (unless someone makes a major mistake).</p>
<p>Billion dollar corporations can afford <em>a lot</em> of security audits, code reviews, DDoS mitigations, etc.</p>
<p>The best way to hack Facebook is social engineering, like getting a job there and then finding out something from the inside. But such a person would be throwing away a very comfortable six-figure career and risking his neck...</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I don't know what the question means, &quot;Old school hackers&quot; to me would be phreaks and I think PBX and telephony technology ended that. </p>
<p>If there are any &quot;hackers&quot; as you say.. Then they are plentiful they come in 4 forms: Script kiddies that only hurt themselves, Scammers (India PC repair, Spear fishing), Big Corp/Big Gov't that are massively successful because the public is dumb as shit, and finally long haul hackers which you hear about all of the time.. Equifax being the last biggest one in my mind. The latter which is what I imagine you are imagining take years to setup and they don't plan on getting caught in the meantime. When the hack is conducted they have already left the company years ago.</p></div>
