(and just in general knowing the term &quot;expression&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28computer_science%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_%28computer_science%29</a> and looking up all different kinds of symbols and what they do in different programming languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket</a> )</p>
<p>however there are a few things that you really have to scavange to find information about, since everyone assumes there's no newbies to programming on the internet. </p>
<p>like when to and not to set semi-colon or newline or whitespace or period or comma or curlybracket or square braces, or even empty parenthesis. simple things like that. second guessing and being confused over every single keystroke that is made in the code.</p>
<p>(and how to use them/exceptions, or in conjuction, or even what type they are (operators, terminators, seperators, etcetera) or things like iostream or stdio.h, simple things like that. just something that lists relevant terms and functions and how to use it.)</p>
<p>something that also helped alot was this <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2454675">https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2454675</a> and this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43f44291.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/43f44291.aspx</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no one way to develop code. Writing code is like writing a book and you have different styles of writing and different types of books. </p>
<p>The syntax of what you write is less important than the structure of your program. And the structure of your program will define you classes and functions. For every project that will be different. When you develop, you must focus on what your program must do and as a consequence use design pattern if they fit or kick them out when they don't fit.  Not the way around that a design pattern dictates how your program will work.</p>
<p>Where you put your brackets, new lines,.... is irrelevant. Just make it consistent over your project. I use the K&amp;R style because it puts more code on your screen and not waste space. My goal is to have functions that fits into your screen so you can see it in an instance what it does without need of scrolling. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don't you try and make a reference web site with this information yourself? it will help you learn about programming and the underlying structure for each programming language. It will also teach you about refrain and focus, it will teach you that you need to work and think in a very structured fashion, it will ingrain in your brain abstract problem solving and makes you realize that the programming language is just a tool to execute that solution, and so, that the solution of the puzzle is more important than the medium of the puzzle.</p>
<p>I believe that a true programmer is lazy, not the kind of lazy that doesn't want to do anything and only finds excuses, but the lazy kind that hates repetitive work and finds a way to minimize it. You don't have this mentality, you are asking other people to solve your specific problem and the only payoff is the good feeling for helping only you. If you want to learn, Do!</p>
<p>All the information you want is online, if it's helpful to you, compile it, and if you feel it's useful to someone else, release it. Start by solving your own problems, only then you can solve someone else's problem (for a fee).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it helps if you have an underlying understanding of how programming languages work, but here's some references:</p>
<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/langref.php">http://php.net/manual/en/langref.php</a><br />
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/syntax.html">http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Manual/man-1.4/syntax.html</a><br />
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/">https://docs.python.org/3.5/reference/</a><br />
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/index-language.html">http://perldoc.perl.org/index-language.html</a></p>
<p>None of these will tell you how the languages work behind the scense.  They tell you how to work with the languages themselves.  When it comes down to it, there's not a whole lot of big differences between languages, though people like to pretend that there are.</p>
<p>The biggest differences between languages is whether they are functional or imperative.  Of the above listed, Perl is probably the most interesting.  It has no built-in object system, but you can use the features of the language to build an object system.  Unfortunately, this means that there are many different object systems running around in its libraries now.</p>
<p>Most O'Reilly books have an introduction book for a language that covers most of the concepts, etc.  The Perl ones are a lot of fun, actually.</p></div>
