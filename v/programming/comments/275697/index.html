    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with the title - the problem isn't with the software teams, the problem is with management prioritizing certain tasks over others - possibly even for good reasons. The function of a company is to make money, not just to make great software. I tend to think the latter leads to the former, but sometimes you have to make bad choices because of financial or other non-technical reasons.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, however getting the balance right is key. Many companies make bad decisions over very long time frames, each decision justifiable in its own right leading up to complete failure. For example many of the banks in the UK are facing significant IT failures due to their technical debt (e.g. charging cards twice, customers unable to withdraw funds). These situations happen one tiny step at a time. A good delivery team are responsible for their quality - you can't blame it on someone else.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think you have a point. The vast majority of software development is done in a shoddy way, this includes Scrum and other agile approaches. However if you have a high performing team they will do better using these approaches. This is the big secret that none of the books will never tell you. With a great team you can do any methodology and be successful, with a shit team you'll always fail. However I think with a great team you'll get more done and higher quality using agile approaches verses something like Waterfall or RUP.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the idea of SCRUM. It tries to mimic good developers. But the problem is that it tries too hard and actually kills the good developers and leave the bureaucrat developers in your team that follow the SCRUM rules to the letter.</p>
<ul>
<li>SCRUM would probably work if you have one guy in that team that does not follow the planning. That guy will clean up the code and fix bugs. </li>
<li>SCRUM would also probably work when there is no fixed demo date set but is more relaxed. e.g. postpone the demo 1 or even 2 weeks later, because you want to make sure that your code has the minimal quality, before proceeding.</li>
<li>SCRUM would also work when you never show the progress graph to your developers; It is always depressing to see that you failed again to reach the target. It really kills moral after 2 or more sprints.</li>
