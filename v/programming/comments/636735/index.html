    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree. </p>
<p>There so much resources online. Between youtube lectures, so, github, and online interpreters (like jsfiddle) alone, i simply can't keep up. </p>
<p>And in recent years there has been stuff like rust, meteor, datomic, streams, transpilers, and tooling improved bounds and leaps (jetbrains/vs, git, jira/trello, webpack, linters).</p>
<p>Diving in a book was a different experience, you learnt how to do stuff before understanding the why. For me the main issue is more sorting through the click-baitey blogs and the sheer amount of stuff. But for god sake, now there are programming languages dedicated to help kids learn. I can't tell if the quality of young programmers did improve thou, as my sample size of padawans is way too small.</p>
<p>Computer science itself is slow moving, we might get a shiny new js framework each week, but fundamentals are quite engraved. Allocation (immutability/concurrency), language types (functional, imperative, etc) have seen no real evolution. Few have the opportunity to implement the real new stuff like weak ia. </p>
<p>I don't know what programming language you are using, but i doubt you are &quot;stuck with 2009 problems&quot;, and I have a hard time understanding your feeling, or what you envision the situation should be.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>We have definitely moved forward but also at same time still rely on the same principals of programming that pascal (lol! Forgot about those hard tabs!), fortran and lisp.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I'm seeing a lot of convergence, especially in web languages. PHP has gotten so much better in the last 2 years that ruby and Python are becoming a lifestyle choice compared to a better choice.</p>
<p>Design patterns are also becoming a thing that more people understand besides hard core Java people.</p>
<p>Still miss books though :-)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>By the time books are published the new flavor of the day is already 2 years stale!</p>
<p>In the php world Laravel was just exiting 3.x and today is already on 5.1.x. The PDF book writers just can't keep up. PHP itself is going from 5.3/5.4 2 years ago to the latest 7 (6 got skipped).</p>
<p>StackOverflow and communities are way more helpful.</p>
<p>Note: I saved my first program that I copied out of a magazine on casset tape :-D</p></div>
