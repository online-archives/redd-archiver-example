      <div class="md"><p>In a recent comment I compiled the following examples of Github engaging in SJWism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Github forced developers to remove the word &quot;retard&quot; from their comments or have all their code deleted within 24 hours: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9966118">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9966118</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Github deleted and banned the members of &quot;C Plus Equality,&quot; a satirical programming language written for feminists: <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/12/14/1618239/github-takes-down-satirical-c-plus-equality-language">https://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/12/14/1618239/github-takes-down-satirical-c-plus-equality-language</a> (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/FeministSoftwareFoundation/c-plus-equality">BitBucket censored it too</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/ErisBlastar/cplusequality">Here's a fork that's still under the radar</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub's official Code of Conduct (that everyone has to agree to) says there's no such thing as &quot;reverse-semism,&quot; &quot;reverse-racism,&quot; and &quot;cisphobia&quot; and that they won't act on complaints regarding those, nor will they stop anyone from &quot;criticizing racist, sexist, cisseist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.&quot; <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/107">https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/107</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They've hired actual racists (or &quot;reverse-racists&quot; as they'd call them) and have internal presentations like this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/TM5Dofg.png">https://i.imgur.com/TM5Dofg.png</a> (Nicole Sanchez, Berkeley professor, hired as &quot;VP of Social Impact&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They've hired completely pointless &quot;coding grrrls&quot; like Coraline Ada Ehmke, a reprehensible human being and the furthest thing from the developer she claims to be:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Humorously Ehmke attacked Github because she wasn't satisfied with the turnaround time of their censorship/anti-harassment support tickets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first I had my doubts. I was well aware of GitHub's very problematic past, from its promotion of meritocracy in place of a management system to the horrible treatment and abuse of its female employees and other people from diverse backgrounds. I myself had experienced harassment on GitHub. As an example, a couple of years ago someone created a dozen repositories with racist names and added me to the repos, so my GitHub profile had racial slurs on it until their support team got around to shutting them down a few days after I reported the incident. I didn't get the sense that the company really cared about harassment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://where.coraline.codes/blog/my-year-at-github/">https://where.coraline.codes/blog/my-year-at-github/</a></p>
<p>Ehmke also led a very disruptive attack on the Ruby community to try and force them to adopt a SJW-esque code of conduct: <a href="https://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/12004">https://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/12004</a> (Reddit post about it: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/42ekqk/industry_the_ruby_programming_language_community/">https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/42ekqk/industry_the_ruby_programming_language_community/</a>) and got installed as a &quot;Diversity and Inclusion Chair&quot; at a machine learning conference (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/7kroqx/sjws_begin_infestation_of_the_machine_learning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/7kroqx/sjws_begin_infestation_of_the_machine_learning/</a>)</p>
<p>Prior to being hired she also would launch campaigns to get contributors banned from projects for their off-site, unrelated activity: <a href="https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941">https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941</a>. Remember, this is the woman who Sanchez hired</p>
<ul>
<li>Github forced out their CEO over apparently falsified accusations of sexual misconduct towards its female employees: <a href="https://archive.fo/WqctO">https://archive.fo/WqctO</a>. This is possibly an instance of the observed attempts to try and get popular white male coders framed for sexual assault. Here's a prominent developer claiming this, including feminists trying to frame Linus Torvalds: <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/06/linus_torvalds_targeted_by_honeytraps_says_eric_raymond/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/11/06/linus_torvalds_targeted_by_honeytraps_says_eric_raymond/</a></li>

Having the government take care of you is an attractive idea to those who do not wish to take care of themselves. Until they realize how horrible it actually is in practice. 
Wrestling back our education system and teaching them the benefits of a capitalist constitutional republic will have a longer lasting effect.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. When you keep telling someone that water is wet and they reply water is racist and when you persist they either: 1) fight you, 2) scream over you, 3) mace you, 4) defame you, 5) bike lock you, 6) accuse you of rape...then yes extermination is a feasible counter-measure.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man, is it really like this in the tech industry nowadays?</p>
<p>There was that male programmer at Google who wrote about their stupid SJW culture and got fired, then it turned out there was a creature similar to Ehmke at Google, apparently spending his/&quot;her&quot; time on the company bulletin board badmouthing &quot;cis&quot; white males and creating a poisonous atmosphere.</p>
<p>On the plus side, if you're a guy who wants to work in tech, just put on a dress for the interview. They'll be on tiptoes to avoid affronting you.</p></div>
