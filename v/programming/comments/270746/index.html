    <div class="md"><p>You know I'm not even sure if my stuff would be considered good. I mean I try and find the best way possible to solve a problem, I do a lot of planning, even write out pseudocode on paper before actually programming if I work on something serious. My prof's say I go beyond their expectations, but that's not really the same as saying your a good programmer or have the potential to be. So I hope I don't ever find out I'm part of that group, and if I am I want to get out of it asap. </p></div>

Sure you are going to make mistakes, but you are far more likely to refactor and fix a potential mess if you are self conscious about your code. The ones that say &quot;Who cares?&quot; or &quot;No one will ever look at it&quot; are the ones you want to avoid.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has a lot to do with the fact that up until about 5 years ago programming was seen as a &quot;male hobby&quot;. There was a neckbeard type stigma attached to it for a long time. That stigma is starting to fade and women are getting more interested in computers, so I feel like we'll start to see a lot more female programmers in the future.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know are women programmers. But really all I know is one woman programmer besides myself so it's still not very many. And both of us are fairly new to it (less than 3 years) and only stumbled into it becausse of our uni's math requirements. If comp sci was a requirement for every college student, like algebra is, then I bet more women would get into programming. </p>
<p>I have a question for you tho, would you say it's more difficult for a woman to get a decent job as a programmer? Or is it about the same, or even easier? You may not even know, I just thought I'd ask.</p></div>

<p>Probably easier. Of female programmers I know, the distribution of their skills was basically the same as that of the male programmers I knew, so most of them could easily compete for the same jobs. Diversity is a buzzword now though, so there are lots of gender-specific opportunities out there for scholarships, internships, etc. They aren't jobs per se, but they definitely help you to get a foot in the door.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The place i work at is a 50/50 split  right now,and as a guy its not that bad of an environment.</p>
<p>That said what we do is just outside of coding (more simulations and control systems) so maybe that helps keep it a more even split</p></div>
