<p>The Rise of NetBeans — Why The Increasingly Popular IDE Has Streamlined Java Application Development for a Network of 1.5M+ Active Users - HostingAdvice.com </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'NetBeans IDE is more well known as the popular web development tool that streamlines the building and deployment of applications. ' </p>
<p>'According to the development team, it was the first Java IDE written in Java. ' </p>
<p>'NetBeans has always moved forward with the mission to keep up with the Java platform, and that’s why all major releases of the IDE have coincided with releases of the Java Development Kit (JDK). ' </p>
<p>'The NetBeans IDE is a development tool, but it is also a desktop windowing platform that allows complex applications to be built and deployed in Java and other languages. ' </p>
<p>'The rise in academic usage of NetBeans is attributable to a program Sun Microsystems started before the Oracle acquisition, Bill told us. ' </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was the lead developer on a large project that was primarily Java, but had elements requiring C, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Javascript.  A few parts of the project used SVN for version control, most of it used Git.</p>
<p>After struggling with Eclipse and all of its plug-ins and updates and incompatibilities, slowness and random crashes, I got fed up and gave NetBeans a try.  I had last tried it when it was around version 4.x (4.5ish maybe..) and it was real slow and buggy.  At this point 6.0 had just been released. </p>
<p>I installed it and and was stunned that it did everything I needed right out of the box.  It had its quirks and a few bugs, but nothing that couldn't be worked around.  After a couple weeks of using NetBeans myself, I helped the other developers transition to NetBeans and we never looked back.  Each new version was smoother and more polished than the last and upgrades never broke anything.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of Oracle.  I think they have screwed up or ignored projects I care about.  I hope NetBeans never becomes a victim of Oracle's negative influence.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, NetBeans supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java,</li>
<li>C,</li>
<li>C++ (and Qt),</li>
<li>PHP,</li>
<li>HTML5/Javascript (With a great Chrome addon for debugging your project),</li>
<li>Python (via a plugin, for NetBeans 8.0 and 8.1, but not 8.2,yet)</li>
<li>Version control (CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial built in, others via plugins)</li>
<li>Audrino development (via plugin)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're looking for a full featured IDE, I highly recommend giving NetBeans a try.</p></div>
