<li>Uninteresting customer: Randomize the google searches so your data becomes random.</li>
<li>Pretend to be an AI bot? Retweet facebook and twitter tweets without regard of content.</li>
<li>Pretend to be a happy family? Have profiles so that the teen age son surf for porn at certain times, the dad at other times to to chat with the mistress, and the mum googling for new receipts.</li>

<p>Even better if you portray yourself as one of those select target markets that the big corps like to throw free shit at - senior Insurance executives, doctors, CEO's - the guys who get $500 just to come to the Mercedes dealership to test drive the most expensive car on the lot.</p>
<p>Yes, they exist.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep you can take any identity you want.</p>
<p>I have noticed recently that the Internet is forgetting who I am. Up until a few years ago &quot;the Internet never forgets&quot;. However with all these privacy tracking, telemetry data, the big companies gets so overwhelmed that they have to filter the data and interestingly enough all the data I find on myself are outdated, wrong and unusable. Even though my name is still out there it gets corrupted with data that they try to complete but is completely wrong.</p>
<p>The added bonus is that big data is so vast that big companies can't even verify anymore if their data is actually valid or pure corrupted and fakes.</p></div>

<p>We should not have one discussion how to pollute the privacy data, it should be flooded with many different people all talking and discussion how to do it. Variation is key here so the other people gets enough interest to start their own variant.</p>
<p>It should become so on the top of discussions so that even search engines will  show people how to hide their privacy by noise.</p></div>
