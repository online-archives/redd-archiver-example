    <div class="md"><p>I develop and do consulting on electronic toll collection systems (E-ZPass and similar) and the vast majority of the work I do and oversee is written in C.  GUI elements like toll collector touch screens, and front ends of systems that administrators use, are often written in higher level languages, but the core stuff is almost always in C.  Particularly roadside stuff: the computers that process vehicles going through booths and under gantries, and the cameras, RFID readers, and other sensor systems, all work in soft-realtime and need to be written in C.    
</p>
<p>For what it's worth, it also pretty much all runs under various flavors of Linux.  Big iron stuff like backend databases tends to run on corporate distros like Red Hat or Oracle, while smaller systems run on specialized distros aimed at embedded systems.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This won't help on its own, but I found that one of the big tricks behind drawing illustrations and cartoons is to think visually. We can only draw what we can see, but since cartoons are not real you  have to visualize them in your mind to see them. </p>
<p>The next time you want to make an illustration, try to imagine the whole picture before you start. Imagine all the little details, and how they connect and relate to each other to form the whole picture. Once you can clearly see an image it becomes a mere act of patience and dedication to get it onto paper.</p>
<p>Also, don't let a perceived lack of talent, knowledge, or experience stop you from drawing. They make things faster and easier, but they are in no way necessary to get started, or even to create whatever you want to create. </p></div>

I know there was a period of butthurt by C programmers from back in the day that thought they were all powerful because &quot;it's basically assembly,&quot; but you know what? You didn't code the world's cool shit with C and neither did anyone else. So.... yeah... let's not attempt to rewrite history here.. and for new people here the butthurt by C programmers is real.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Java? Really? I am not saying you are wrong, but personally java seems like the 21st century equivalent of COBOL to me. They are both decent languages, with an awesome infrastructure behind them, but ultimately they are the tools, and the result of the corporate IT environments of their time. They are not something I would even think of to try and do &quot;cool shit&quot; with. Unless your definition of &quot;cool shit&quot; is &quot;fitting seamlessly into an established business IT environment.&quot; </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Android apps are written in java. Android had blown the internet wide open. Like, everything else that can be said about the internet nowadays stems from that. I suppose you could generalize it and say the &quot;smartphone&quot; revolution, but Android has had the biggest influence - by a large margin.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Really not true... Java's earliest forms date back to mid-1991, while the first website dates to December 1990. Further, the Internet has been around since 1969, and widespread information processing has been available at a corporate level since the 1950s. Java has been around for a while, but it wasn't nearly as significant in the early stages of the www as you're suggesting.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you define as &quot;the information age&quot;? For me, the information age began in the 70s. During the 90s, people started using the Internet in droves, and the vast majority of everything was written in C: Linux, Apache, Sendmail, Bind, DHCP, PostGres, Windows, third party TCP/IP software... Sun started developing Java as a toy that would run as interpreted code in a browser, but the Internet was well established by then.  Web sites were everywhere, AltaVista and Dogpile ruled the web, Cantor and Segal had spammed me, Punch-the-Monkey banner ads assaulted our senses, and Google and Java VMs didn't exist yet.</p></div>

<p>I'd rather not debate <em>when</em> exactly it started. but the paradigm did not begin in the 70s or even 80s, maybe the 90s but in recent years java has brought the apps to people phones that got them to use the internet.</p>
<p>EDIT:
I'd also like to add that I'm fully aware that Java was ultimately derived from C and C is the base for OSes and blah blah blah... and that's not what I'm talking about. C != Java and Java was what actually enabled the information age as <em>almost everyone</em> knows it, that is to say it's what created the &quot;paradigm.&quot; </p>
<p>Lastly, and this is not in direct response to you MoniteredCitizen, but other responders as well, but I feel that everything I'm saying can be understood from my OP (and if it doesn't make sense from context of the topic and conversation then too bad), and I'm not interested in making any more corrections or further explaining myself unless it's part of a progressive, non-argumentative conversation.</p>
<p>And again, there are C programmers from decades ago I have seen express their butthurt, and I know it's real because of their &quot;I am all powerful&quot; (for knowing C) mentality. To them I say: nana nana boo boo stick your head in doodoo, you're old.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>To you, it was apparently smartphones and Java that &quot;got people to use the Internet&quot; because that was about the time that you became aware of it. In other words, you're very young. To me, I was one of millions of people that were chatting on IRC, Usenet, and Compuserve and surfing the web before smartphones or Java existed.  Sure I'm old, but that doesn't mean that the information age, the period of time when data about everything began traversing the globe over electronic systems, wasn't already in full swing before it became part of your life.</p></div>
