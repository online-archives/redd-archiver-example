<p>Anyway, my question of wasting my time.  Am I?  Will getting a basic course on several languages help?  Do I need to pick one language and try to excel in it?  I already know I don't like HTML.  I did enjoy VB and C++.  I'm very interested in Java simply because I want to develop Android apps.</p></div>

Languages are just tools in your toolbox. You won't be able to make anything unless you know how to use your tools properly if that makes sense. I've heard that it's good to take courses in compilers, OS, data structures, stuff like that. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The most important thing is going to be the fundamentals... Logic and flow control doesn't vary much between languages. Things like &quot;should I use file system storage or a database for this portion?&quot; and how to properly implement GUI stuff without causing extra overhead tend to be more important in the long run. More advanced aspects of various languages can be picked up as you go. I'd probably go advanced with a single language... C#, Java, or C++... just to have something to really show a prospective employer.</p>
<p>Also, please learn to fucking document everything you do... code comments, proper labels, diagrams, etc.... because I can tell you from experience that it's not fun to diagnose problems with undocumented code filled with random workarounds 15 years after the developer was fired.</p>
<p>I'd drop the &quot;networking&quot; major... that entire portion of the degree can be made up with a couple classes and CCNA/P certification.</p></div>

I've been earning a nice salary with the network stuff, and the programming work is starting to pay off as well. I have an overlapping skill set that not a lot of people have - strong networking AND programming capabilities. So...&quot;why not both?&quot;</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Breaking down things into smaller easier problems is exactly what mathematics teaches you. And yea, okay , You don't have to like math but I bet you use it in your day to day programming activities. This person is saying they can barely pass college algebra. If they don't have the motivation to break down their algebra problems into smaller easier to manage thing what are they going to do when they get into a huge code base or something they don't like. Foundations in math are used in programming. </p>

<p>I see exactly what you mean now. Factoring a quadratic equation is breaking it down into smaller pieces. As is simplifying radicals.</p></div>

<p>Those math classes scare the shit out of me. Advanced calculus? Pfft, I'd be happy to pass college algebra. </p>

<p>Others have picked up on the programming specifics, but I'd like to pick up on this specifically. I've been a software engineer for 15 years, and it's true I haven't used that advanced maths very often. I expect there are specialist fields where you use it lots, but they're the exception. However, here's the thing: all the good programmers I know were also really good at maths in school. So, while it's not important in itself, I've always considered it a bit of an aptitude test.</p></div>

But if you see your future as a solid developer, then I highly recommend that you at least take a data structures &amp; algorithms course and definitely do as much work on the side as you can, because the real experience comes from tinkering around.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can at least get an associates degree that will count for something to some people.</p>
<p>VB is not fashionable.  I would say get the associates with minimal effort, in the meanwhile DO pay attention to trendy 'buzzwords' because newer languages and technologies usually ARE more relevant because they are more marketable skills.</p>
<p>Make an Android app with a map of your campus.</p>
<p>Its a good idea to focus a bit but definitely don't force it, especially early on you want a broader exposure I think.  If you are interested in something then play around with it.</p>
<p>The trick I think is to have projects and train yourself.  Things change, and even religions like SQL fall out of favor.  The best way to use your time is to be good at Googling or npm module searching so that you can take advantage of recent thinking or advances.</p>
<p>In some countries/provinces an associates degree makes you legit for working, like for teaching English (if you ever want to try living in Asia), so I would get that.</p>
<p>Also, not all bachelor's programs are that hard, and you can take your time.  If you can find a cheap BS CS degree that gives you an advantage in that no one can have one over on you on that count.</p>
<p>I wish I had finished the four year degree.  Algebra isn't that hard.  The trick is having friends for support and not having too many classes or work at the same time.</p>
<p>But that is for the paper, not the knowledge.  The concept of a curriculum and college in general is obsolete.  To learn you need to try to build projects, google/internet read relevant topics, copy code and modify for your purpose, ask questions and try to work with real programmers such as on open source projects.  The main trick is having interesting projects to play around with.  They don't have to be big projects.</p>
<p>And you can google big topics like software engineering, test-driven development, project management, data structures and algorithms, deep learning, etc.  I would go so far as to say that if you are good at Googling and sorting through results, free websites/books etc., IRC, livecoding.tv, etc. and then doing experiments and teaching yourself from those sources, the internet is better than MIT or Stanford.  Actually you can access some great Stanford/MIT/etc material online.</p></div>
