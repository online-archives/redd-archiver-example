Having some of your assets at another location can help parallelize your load time.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>There are pros and cons of both options, and even some additional options.</p>
<p>If you are concerned with bandwidth, and storage space then you may want to call them from an external source.</p>
<p>If that is not a problem then you may prefer to host them yourself which may be be slightly faster since it does not require a second server be contacted for resources. </p>
<p>Also if you link to them on a third-party server that third party will have an additional data point to track your websites users, which may or may not be an issue depending on your users and content.</p></div>

<p>Do both.</p>

script src='your cdn and script of choice' /script
script

        //create script element with src='local copy of script of choice'
