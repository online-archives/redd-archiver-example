<p>Clearly from this response no effort was made to find out if Mr. Robot was programming related, furthermore the &quot;Your submission links to some YouTube video with no real relevance to it. This rule is violated.&quot; was a link directly contrasting other media portrayals of programmers in main stream tv shows. Alas how is this not programming related?</p></div>

<p>Among TV shows that depict such things, it's actually really high up there in terms of accuracy and not having a giant glowing GUI with &quot;HACK BUTTON&quot; on it.</p>
<p>Which, if people here let up harping on the OP for five seconds and actually checked out what he was talking about, would know. Too hard, I guess.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand by my decision. A random TV show, as I said in a reply to your comment on it, does not qualify for being programming related. Even a TV show actually teaching programming is questionable, as the audience in here is global and not America-only (Where a America-only TV show would maybe work). You can replace America with anything else, it serves as example of a non-global audience.</p>

<p>While I find random to be not helpful in describing the nature of the issue with the program, I am without insight into what specifically makes this program random.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the country of origin matters for programming related content, programming is a global commonality, and programming themes will be the same regardless, if an Australian programming show accurately depicted/taught programming (and was ground breaking in this effort) should someone not post it because it came from Australia?</p>

<p>As long it's directly linked through the submission, it's fine. If only a selected few can access it, it's likely to be removed. That's the point I was trying to make. YouTube (Or any other web service on that matter!) is fine because everyone can watch it from anywhere. If it's region locked, it's again borderline.</p>
<p>If it really is that groundbreaking (Which I'd applaud!), the show is sure to appear on YouTube, and based on that it's educational in terms of programming and not a 'correct' depiction of it, are <strong>welcome</strong> as submission. Don't read too much into ground-breaking, please. The most important factor is that it's widely accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>It's just not my job to read through Google about TV shows.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: Forgot to mention that yes, input on the rules and such META stuff are of course appreciated.</p>
<p><em>Edit²</em>: Is this: <code>4. Submissions are expected to be educational, and not only about programming (E.g. movies, TV)</code> good or crap wording-wise? </p></div>

<p>Ah ok! Now I understand thank you! That is not at all clear from the guidelines! For the record this show is available on youtube, if only aspects of it. I don't have cable anything I watch is on the internet, in this day and age it cannot be assumed that a TV show is only available in a specific location. While I understand where you are coming from, this does not feel like a completely altruistic action.</p>

<p>I agree it isn't your job, however not being familiar with something programming related does not mean it isn't programming related and therefore should be removed. Your community could be better served if a degree of latitude is exercised if participants in a conversation are demonstrating a familiarity with the topic, and you aren't aware of it, so maybe you can let the community vote on whether it fits into programming if you don't feel like doing the work on your own. Carte blanche removing of topics benefits no one, and feels a bit like another atmosphere a lot of us have left because of this type of reaction.</p></div>

<p>I do think that deleting is the correct answer to submissions not fitting the rules, but I'd also like to have some kind of public log where people could go and judge themselves. I was thinking about like having a bi-monthly sticky to discuss the META stuff and post a list there of removed things. The reasons why the removal happened are put by me always as comment into the submission, for the OP to respond to, or at least get some kind of understanding why it was removed.</p>
<p>A second step on this would be having a bot or something which auto-updates the removal list. There's currently no API for that, and with the current situation I also can't write one which uses the HTML data as 'API'. </p>
<p>A completely community driven deletion-through-downvote process may or may not work well on the long run. I don't have any statistics, so I have to assume that not many can actually downvote. Also, I fear that we'd lose interested people because someone spams the sub (maybe from multiple accounts).</p>
<p>Would I appreciate this concept? Yes! But right now, with the state of voat, there's not a lot of tools at hand to do anything, hell, Reddit at least has some kind of tools, where I have literally none besides &quot;delete&quot;. (Send me a mod mail .. oh right .. you can't -.- )</p>
<p>In the end, I can only delete what I as user wouldn't like to see here at all. If you fear that I kept you from tons of fascinating threads, you don't have to.

    <div class="md"><p>First, I think it's important to say: <strong>These rules only apply to submissions</strong>!</p>
<p>Comments in submissions are <em>not</em> targeted. You can freely talk about anything in there. Jokes, memes, click-bait? Happy commenting! You can cuss in there, you can even insult people and I'll leave it alone for the world to see your behaviour. The exception is of course when comments start doxxing or beyond stupid stuff like that. That's covered by the site-wide rules I guess.</p>
<p>Submissions are subject to the rules. You are correct: The link in your comment is <em>borderline</em>. That particular news article may be ok, as long they don't get too much. This isn't <a href="/v/todayilearned">/v/TodayILearned</a> after all. Just the YouTube clip showing that? Most likely violation of rule two.</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn't get too much&quot;: This loose term is there to stay loose. I can't give any hard numbers. If posts of these kind don't pile up, it's okay-ish. Not encouraged either. If it gets too much, maybe multiple submissions on the first page, they're more likely to be deleted. Reasoning is, that if this happens, others will feel encouraged that it's fine to do this.</p>
<p>There's currently (Or was?) some kind of joke on the page. A single one. That's okay-ish. Not encouraged. A second one may be too much though.</p>
<p>I think it's fair to demand from the moderation to be transparent about it. But I also think it's fair to think that the mods won't begin and deleting stuff for political reasons. If a mod under would do that, that'd be a kick.</p>
<p>I was thinking about playing with submission flairs. Right now I think they're broken (Ugh..). Anyway, what I envision is having a &quot;soft-delete&quot; flair, which hides the submission by default, but is visible through some other mean. Maybe in night mode or something. Just an idea, I haven't even checked yet if that'd be possible. But would be cool, wouldn't it?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I think the problem we're facing is it's hard to define a subverse named &quot;programming&quot;. That's a <em>wide</em> range. So right off the bat you're in an awkward spot because of that.</p>
<p>Personally I'd prefer to see content like that as it relates to something only a programmer would care about or even understand. I doubt most on TIL know what CRC32 even <em>is</em> much less recognized it in the movie so I would argue it easily belongs here much less is borderline.</p>
<p>Another good example to consider is an interview about Kevin Mitnick (let's imagine this was more than a decade ago) on Oprah or something.</p>
<p>I suppose an interesting line in the modern grass is Edward Snowden. I would imagine reading about <em>how</em> he pulled some things off (from the <em>technical</em> aspect) would be reasonable but the political aspect of it would not be -- because quite frankly some of that was pretty damn impressive and I imagine many programmers would do well to learn many of those aspects of security. Or perhaps that might be better of in a security specific subverse. hmm.</p>
<p>Just something for you to ponder about ahead of time.</p></div>

<p>If it gets beefy, okay-ish <strong>if</strong> everyone can watch it and it's <em>directly</em> linked through the submission. So either the submission is a link submission linking to the online video, <em>or</em> it's a text submission with a link pointing to the online video. No Paywall, just content.</p>

<p>I agree. So, if it would be an article how he abused programmer mistakes and it gets beefy, I think it's relevant. But if he <em>just</em> (Not trying to downplay) abused mis-configured permissions for access (Afaik he at one point said that he had permissions to impersonate other user accounts which he then abused), I think that's more something for <a href="/v/sysadmin">/v/sysadmin</a> (If that's already a thing).</p>
<p>I'm starting to feel that there should be <a href="/v/programminginmedia">/v/ProgrammingInMedia</a> </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I don't see what's confusing. A TV show designed to be consumed for entertainment is not directly related to programming.

    <div class="md"><p>Popular culture != programming.</p>
<p>Yeah, it has programmers in it, but generally we come here for discussion of programming, not what was on TV last night.</p>
<p>If a post is here on this sub it should have some code, or at least theory.</p>
<p>Your post was a valid discussion... for someplace else. It's kind of like all the conspiracy theorists spamming <a href="/v/news">/v/news</a>. It's like, &quot;Yeah, we fucking know that you believe the Jews did 9/11, but just because some conspiracy blog says so doesn't mean it's news worthy&quot;.</p>
<p>So, yeah. I back the mod on this one.</p></div>
