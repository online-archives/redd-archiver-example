    <div class="md"><p>C++ primer is a good book but only if you have gone through a newbie C++ book first. I went through a book my someone with last name zak that turned out to be horrible. I'm going through the primer book now and it's hands down the best C++ book for anyone who is a level higher than newbie. You will learn a TON with 1k pages of densely packed knowledge. This book takes you to the next level. A bit dry and no fun for my tastes. I own the print version and the thing is huge and it's thick as hell with thin pages. Weighty.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you know this already, but be aware that, and this is the case with many languages, it's one thing to learn C++ the language but it's another to produce something working. Python you just write the code and it goes. In something like C++ you have to learn about the compiler, external libraries, OS-specific details as well as the language itself. I've always personally found it a little daunting.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Answers to your question:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No. Invest in good learning materials. Buy good books. The reason is, there is a lot of garbage-y or outdated information on the internet that will teach you bad things. The truth is, the answer to your question is &quot;yes&quot;, but it's a lot easier with books, so save yourself the trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Books I always recommend to C++ beginners: Lippman's &quot;C++ Primer&quot;, followed by Scott Meyers' &quot;Effective C++&quot; and &quot;Effective Modern C++&quot;. You should also probably read  &quot;A Tour of C++&quot; by Bjarne. I'd say hold off on reading the other, more well-known Bjarne's book, it's big and fairly difficult to  get through. Once you get more experience, you can try  reading the standard (the formal document that defines what C++ is) a bit, and get an understanding of how tough a C++ compiler author's job is :)</p>
