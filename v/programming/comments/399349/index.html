    <div class="md"><p>A lot of gender studies, women's studies, feminism classes teach that everything is the fault of the white straight male. That only the white straight male can be racist or sexist. White straight males are evil, the devil. When IT jobs start going to people with degrees in gender studies or women's studies you know the company is going into SJW mode because instead of hiring for information systems or computer science degrees they hire for humanities and art degrees and just let them attack the white straight males and drive them out of the company. For diversity and equal rights, of course, they claim.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That worldview is not based on logic or reason, it is based on hatred of the white straight male. Hate never passes intellectual scrutiny. </p>
<p>The only reason why there are so many white straight males in computer science and information systems is that is the only group that studied them to get a degree in them to be qualified for the job. There is nothing to stop a female or non-white person to take those courses but few do.</p>
<p>Let me explain it with a 9Gag cartoon:
<a href="http://9gag.com/gag/a6ye7xR/gender-pay-gap-in-stem-fields-explained">http://9gag.com/gag/a6ye7xR/gender-pay-gap-in-stem-fields-explained</a></p>
<p>You got STEM and Gender Studies, women refuse to sign up for STEM and choose Gender Studies instead and then protest that STEM is mostly white straight males. If they chose STEM instead they'd have the same jobs as their male counterparts. </p></div>

<p>Protection from discrimination includes protection from a ‘hostile working environment’, which again applies in the UK and US. Any company which says it is ok to harass some people <strong>can potentially be sued by all of those people regardless of whether they have actually been affected by the policy.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only employees but <strong>customers</strong> ... would be entitled to sue (see, for example, s29 Equality Act 2010). Furthermore their <strong>customers could be sued</strong> if they required any employee to work on the openly racist project. Worse for Ms Palamountain, UK law allows individual Defendants. Every single claimant could sue any individual responsible for discrimination.</p>

<p>No wonder they're back-pedalling - if it became more well-known that Github's paid users could be sued over this policy, the resulting exodus would annihilate their revenue.</p></div>

<p>How can Palamountain be employed now in the technology industry? Even when the policy is inevitably changed or withdrawn, Palamountain will have a tainted reputation. Should she become involved in any dispute or discrimination matter, her past prejudices may be used against her. Internet searches will show up her remarks for years to come undermining her professional credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all started in the Opal project, when they wanted to remove a programmer for making homophobic tweets. What I read about his tweets was stuff like X+Y = Male and X+X = Female on a T-shirt image. It seems like biology stuff. But since Transgender people were offended by it, it became transphobic. There was a thread to remove him, and they refused, so there was another thread to make a CoC or code of conduct for Github projects. It was written by SJWs, and only white males can be sexist or racist according to their definitions. All other forms of racism or sexism towards white males will be allowed and they will not act upon it.</p>
<p>I think this sort of stuff is like another Gamergate scandal. The news media will most likely vilify the white males in this case like they did in Gamergate. It seems to be good for their ratings to bias the news on the SJWs worldview.</p></div>
