    <div class="md"><p>I'm totally opposite. Make beginners feel welcomed and allow beginner questions.</p>
<p>Too often as a beginner you find a new subject you enjoy and so you go online to find communities with similar interests just to be hit in the face by a community that resents you, harshly criticises you and doesn't take into account that you may be a beginner and it totally de-motivates your interest in the subject. I don't want <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> to have a hand in making beginners abandoning the subject, there isn't enough people who can program in the world as it is. Sure make an FAQ for the routinely obvious and nooby questions, but some beginner questions I believe are valid.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn't there be two main issues with getting people to post there, though?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First of all, you have to be ballsy enough to post in an <em>advanced</em> programming sub. There's always the risk of being called a n00b and sent back here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wouldn't it be kind of hard to get advanced programming questions answered? What if one has an advanced question about the Go compiler, but most people hanging there are Java seniors? Questions would definitely be more visible here...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Plus, for the time being this sub has &lt; 600 subscribers. We could definitely wait a bit until we worry about people flooding it with questions about how for and while loops work.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think simply tagging posts could work - maybe have a tag for basic questions, and tags for language specific questions as well?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn't it be kind of hard to get advanced programming questions answered? What if one has an advanced question about the Go compiler, but most people hanging there are Java seniors? Questions would definitely be more visible here...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people would belong in both subs as well - someone could easily be a senior Java dev with a beginner's knowledge of Go.</p>
<p>That said, perhaps the programming sub should focus on questions which are <em>general</em>, and leave language-specific questions to their corresponding subs where possible? So a question about the differences between two languages might belong here, but a question about the best way to do X in Y language would belong in the Y sub (if it existed).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I'm not sure about that. The problem as I see it is that by allowing beginner questions, you'll turn <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> in to <a href="/v/programminghelp">/v/programminghelp</a>. And of course, I have no problem with there being a place for beginners to get help - but I feel like <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> should be more about the general industry/domain of programming. If you allow beginner questions I guarantee that's all you'll get too - because there's 10 beginners for every 1 not-beginner (same in any hobby/skill).</p>
<p>Then again, you could look at it the other way around and do as <a href="/user/swagath">/u/swagath</a> said already and have a <a href="/v/advancedprogramming">/v/advancedprogramming</a> instead.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best way to do this would be to keep <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> as a catch all, but keep the recurring content segretated. What I've seen some subreddits do is to have <a href="http://redd.it/3ci2e6">automated threads</a> for recurring themes. For example, you could have a weekly &quot;Programming Help&quot; thread where users submit what they need help with in the comments, and other users can help them out. </p>
<p>This way the content is segreated, but still part of the main sub, as <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> is expected to have the largest userbase of programmers, so it makes sense to keep the help where all the people good at programming are. </p>
<p>Another thing is, consider who is going to subscribe to <a href="/v/programminghelp">/v/programminghelp</a>. The majority of it is going to be people who need help. Sure there will be people who can help, but they will be fewer as <a href="/v/programminghelp">/v/programminghelp</a> is a sub with limited content, and that content is not interesting to normal good programmers, which once again falls back to the idea of <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> having a much larger programmer userbase.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope the right people see your reply because this is the best idea imo- best of both worlds! Only thing is it makes it harder for question-askers to search previous questions and find out if what they're asking has already been answered... But I guess with stackoverflow and google out there already, most of the common questions should (in theory) not be being asked anyway.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem is people actually assessing where their skill level is relative to arbitrary terms like 'beginner,' 'intermediate,' and 'advanced,' and that's not something exclusive to programming - it's rampant in most if not all fields. On one hand, you have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, and on the other, you have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor syndrome</a>. Creating different subverses to categorize people of different skill levels adds undue stress on newcomers simply because many are uncomfortable in or unable to properly assess themselves.</p>
<p>I'd prefer to see <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> as a catch-all subverse, since it's likely the one that will have the highest visibility out of the programming-related subverses, but we need a comprehensive FAQ/wiki that answers common questions or links to other posts that do and provide a comprehensive list of resources, tools, and related subverses for people to explore at their leisure.</p></div>

<p>One thing that frustrated me on reddit was <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/android">/r/android</a>, for example.  If you had a question, they'd all backlast and tell you to go to <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/androidquestions">/r/androidquestions</a>.  Well that's great.  The problem is that it splits the user base.  There's like nobody in <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/androidquestions">/r/androidquestions</a> so the exposure sucks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does. Stackoverflow does not allow discussion that is mainly opinion-based or lack of research.</p>
<p>But many of programming question is opinion-based (architecture, design, language comparison). Some even goes into holy war, ex: surrogate vs natural keys, emacs vs vim, tab vs spaces for indentation.</p>
<p>And for the lack of research. Programming is all about terms, what if we want to do some research about something but don't know what we want to search? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. To speak to this issue, I believe too many rules killed a lot of good subreddits in general. Subverses should almost be treated as hashtags rather than subforums. People try to break down subforums too much and end up with dead subforums. There should only be two rules: keep it on topic and don't be a dick(optional depending on the subverse).</p></div>

The programming sub at that other place, I felt wasn't very welcoming to people like me who wanted to ask intermediate level questions, and learnprogramming usually doesn't give me very good answers due to being targeted towards beginners. I also got a lot of vibe from the comments in there that a lot of people are elitists and very close minded towards doing things in different / new ways and looking at new programming languages and frameworks.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the main issues we're going to run into as a subverse is that people will come here to ask questions that can be answered with a simple Google search. I'd say I'm fine with simplifying things and welcoming beginners to the subverse but we need to establish that we're not here to answer simple questions or do somebody's homework for them. Encourage beginners to follow lesson plans and ask intelligent questions about how things are designed. Maybe we even have a section in the sidebar that contains resources with defined guidelines for programming languages and where you can learn them.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've avoided <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming</a> for years because it can often be needlessly hostile, especially when presented with the controversial or unconventional. &quot;Why would anyone want to do this?&quot; or &quot;You know you can do XYZ instead, right?&quot; They'll pick at the slightest inaccuracy in a post and dismiss the whole thing. Instead I've stuck to smaller communities of the same topic, like <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/coding">/r/coding</a> or the language-specific subreddits, and now <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I'd prefer a ban on obvious homework questions. Some subreddits get drowned in that noise (example: <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/matlab">/r/matlab</a>) and I end up unsubscribing to avoid it. But maybe that's not the right choice for a catch-all name like <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a>.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we define &quot;beginner questions&quot;?</p>
<p>Are you saying questions like &quot;what's an int?&quot;</p>
<p>How would you rank this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4627330/difference-between-fprintf-printf-and-sprintf">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4627330/difference-between-fprintf-printf-and-sprintf</a></p>
<p>Further, is it acceptable to <em>ask</em> for recommended reading? Wouldn't this group be ideal, due to our experience, for knowing what's practical and what sucks? &quot;No, that book sucks -- it teaches you bad habits.&quot;</p>
<p>What separates us from stackoverflow? It seems, at least to me, the main thing is we link to blog articles and such (keeping current, finding new stuff). So should we redirect programming questions to a site <em>dedicated</em> to programming questions and instead use this as a place for staying current?</p>
<p>I'm thinking out loud here.. not pushing for anything.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This can be improved with <a href="https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/comments/279958">subvoat synonym</a> mechanism. Tagging is better, but require more effort and also require synonym, so subverse synonym should at least give some improvement.</p>
<p>The poster can tag the question as v/prog_design, v/prog_help, v/prog_architecture, v/prog_syntax, v/prog_language, v/prog_feature and all of them can be seen from v/programming. Meanwhile user can also filter into synonym.</p>
<p>That way, you can filter for whatever discussion you like without negating the rest invisible to everyone.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I would concur on most points. You want to 'mix' the more experienced people with the noobs and honestly we're all not experts in everything. I might be great at mySQL/MSSQL and absolute crap at Oracle (totally true). Anyway, I think that we could (might?) have a programmer lite space where people can feel that they can get their feet wet with noob questions or even better a noob question day. Beginner Tuesdays where any question, no matter how lowly, can feel more free to be asked. I think the more likely 'sinking' of it is when threads devolve into X is better than Y.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think unfortunately it was the inevitable effect of a sub growing too big.  Once that happens than the topics of post start to widen to the point where it becomes harder to maintain, especially when there will inevitably be multiple posts of the same exact question, which understandably can frustrate the current subscribers.  For example, you reach a point where you start getting the same &quot;What is the best programming language out there?&quot; every couple days and it can get slightly annoying.

<p>I'm not saying I disagree with you, in fact, I'm a beginner programmer myself.  I just wanted to put my two cents in as to possibly why Reddit structured the subs the way it is.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i agree! I never went on r/learnprogramming or r/programming for this reason. Maybe there should be some kind of &quot;flair&quot; where the person states his level of competency. Then people viewing this subverse that dont care for beginner stuff can just filter it out.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I like having something like <a href="/v/learnprogramming">/v/learnprogramming</a> as a resource for the absolute beginner - a place for those often repeated questions of &quot;Where do I start?&quot;, &quot;What is the best programming language?&quot;, &quot;When should I use a for loop?&quot;. As someone else mentioned, <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> will be the most visible programming resource, and I don't think we should ostracise people for asking &quot;silly&quot; questions (is there even such a thing?), but anything that steps outside of language fundamentals should be fine here, regardless of how simple or complex the problem is.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that the labels should go away. &quot;Beginner&quot;, intermediate, etc.. </p>
<p>I also feel that we shouldn't be strict on how questions are asked. As long as they're relevant to programming and they have a good intent, then the post should be considered valid discussion.. I mean, programming is kind of a generalized &quot;programming&quot; area so this really could include anything. And if people do come in here with questions, being nice and pointing them to learnprogramming(without being mean) will also win more members here. Friendly community is a happy community.</p>
<p>The thing I hated about Reddit was that some of these communities are too elitist for their own good. I had to leave <a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/linux">/r/linux</a> because people kept posting threads about distro-related topics or asking questions, and members of that community kept lynching the OPs who would do this. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm don't really understand the question and I have never had a job programming but I do know that it spits at mn using sc with ef o wv h db p and so on. The numbers use 38 so if I can help someone new  or someone with experience who's to say that other than it programs or not other than a computer.  I personally think we need more programmers or more programmers thinking together and that do be so hard or quick to judge who's perfect or not.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>How about this crazy idea: just let people ask whatever they want and don't be dicks.  If you don't like it, don't upvote.  If it is a question missing key details or just something stupid like 'givr me Angular tutorial', that they should have googled, say so and downvote it.</p>
<p>Don't be dicks, don't automatically 'segregate' or censor, don't tell them to put it in a sub no one reads.  
</p>
<p>Part of having a free forum that you can participate in is giving everyone a chance to participate and seeing some stuff you don't like.</p>

Why chastize them for being curious?
