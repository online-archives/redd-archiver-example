    <div class="md"><p>I'm a bit late to the party, but here's my $0.02.</p>
<p>Every time this question is asked, the general response is a list of everyone's current favorite programming language. This isn't really helpful to you as a new programmer since there aren't any strong reasons for you to start learning with any specific language. Also, most programming languages that you're going to be dealing with are (in a general sense) the same. Once you understand the basics behind writing software, it's fairly easy to pick up the syntax of other languages.</p>
<p>I recommend a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start learning Java. If only because it is currently the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2015">most popular language</a> (As of 2015). Because it's so popular, you won't have any trouble finding tutorials and examples, and getting help when you get stuck in the learning process.</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">Software Design Patterns</a>. I think this is actually more important than learning a language itself. Software design patterns are methods for solving existing problems. They aren't pre-coded solutions, but more of a way to think about common problems you come across when programming. Once you develop a logical problem solving mindset towards software solutions, the coding part comes down to syntax.</li>
<li>Learn how to find software libraries that can do the job for you. There are plenty of people who have run across the same issues you have, and have spent a lot of time finding the solution. Sometimes they're nice enough to put out a library that you can use. I've seen some very smart people waste large amounts of time re-inventing the wheel simply because they didn't think to search for a freely available library.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you start to gain grasp of the programming mindset, and understand how and why software development/programming works, then I would say you should venture out and pick a language that's specific to your needs.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>People have hated Java since the day it was conceived and have been predicting its downfall.</p>
<p>It's now somewhere around 20 years old and is in darn near anything, including being the center of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit only a few months ago.</p>
<p>Java has problems, yes, but it also has tremendous acceptance.  Whether or not it's the <em>best</em> solution is another story and open to interpretation, but don't follow the conga-line of people who generally like promoting their pet language or the latest fad language and scream that Java and C are the incarnation of evil in programming languages.  The story is far more complicated and nuanced than that.</p></div>

Also, Java's documentation is really thorough and easy (relatively) to read through.

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on what you're comfortable with. Java has a lot of support and will generally tell you exactly where you fucked up. But it's very verbose. </p>
<p>But if you're just going in to start learning and you have no idea what to use. Try one of those online games that teaches you how to program. You won't be doing serious programming, but you'll learn the concepts of programming itself. Sort of like swimming in the shallow end before going to the deep end. You can spend a week or two, or more on one of those to get the general ideas of programming, then move on to an actual language and start writing basic programs. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It really depends on what type of programming you're wanting to get into. If you want to build web-based things, you can easily pick up the frontend stuff like HTML and CSS, and then start working with JavaScript (and JQuery). PHP is super easy once you're familiar with JavaScript, and most of the web uses PHP in some form or another (CMS's like WordPress and Joomla are built almost entirely on PHP).</p>
<p>If you're wanting to do stuff like app development, check out Java and / or Python. Ruby on Rails is alright but probably not great for a beginner, but you can build some awesome stuff with all 3 of those.</p>
<p>I would avoid stuff like C/C++ until you've cut your teeth.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I would recommend <a href="https://www.lua.org/">lua</a>. It's a minimalist scripting language so it's easy to grasp and also really fast (compared to other scripting languages like python). It's the first language I learned; I learned it because a game I played let you mod the client with lua scripts. It's not as useful as a language like Java, but a good amount of games have modding systems that use lua and you can embed it really easily in more advanced languages like C.</p>
<p>Edit: If you want some theory about programming languages you can check out some introductory computer science lectures from MIT, like <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Any language can be an ideal place to start, you'll have an awful lot of basics to cover before you can really do anything advanced and the basics don't change much unless you are already familiar with the basics of another language and not all that capable of compartmentalizing what works where and doesn't work elsewhere.</p>
<p>Not all languages are equal but some are just easier to mess up and force you to go back <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rn9PJX0.jpg">snakes and ladders</a> style to rewrite parts while dealing with what past you thought was a good idea or good enough solution at the time. Remember there is no perfect programming language, some work really well for certain kinds of projects while others lend themselves to other kinds of projects while none are exclusively this or that project only.</p>
<p>If you just want to understand how programming works you can find an introduction to C programming guide which should cover the importance of logical planning, incremental changes, testing as you go, data manipulations, how memory gets used and reused, and the limitations of a PC (it does what you tell it 99.99999% of the time and nothing else). Now if you want to make something that other people might like to use like a game, a phone app or something like that then you'd have an easier time learning how to do that with something like Java.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say C# or Java since these two languages have compilers that are pretty good at pointing out beginner mistakes and offering solutions. They also prevent you from directly dealing with more complex things (ex. memory allocation, pointers).</p>
<p>I like Netbeans for Java and VS 2015 community for C#,  they're free.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Learning how to program has less to do with the language and more to do with problem solving.  Either you enjoy and are good at using the tools at hand -- ie. the programming language/development environment -- to solve problems or you should look at some other career.  Accordingly enroll in a beginners programming course and see how it goes.  Added bonus is that when you're done you will be better equipped to answer your original question, assuming you enjoy programming that is.  Note: it has to be a <em>real</em> language though, not something like HTML or Visual Basic.</p>
<p>Good programmers are like good musicians: Learning a new language (instrument) is mostly just learning new syntax (fingering).  Okay, maybe that metaphor is a bit of a stretch but I hope you get what I mean.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that becoming proficient in a language can take weeks or a few months, but becoming an expert takes years.</p></div>

<p>In my opinon?  C/C++ and Java.  Java because it's everywhere, and C/C++ because it's everywhere <em>and</em> it gets close to the actual machine.  There is a reason most kernels are written in C/C++.</p>
<p>There's also COBOL, since a lot of the original programmers of systems written in COBOL are, well, <em>dying</em>.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, unless TI's languages have changed dramatically, then TI-BASIC of almost any stripe is a fairly poor way to learn programming, but it is acceptable if you haven't got a real PC to work with.  As such, I suggest you start there, but realize that you're going to need to move beyond TI-84 at some point.  You will probably rather rapidly outgrow it.  With the TI-84, AFAIK your only choices are TI-BASIC and assembly, and I'm pretty sure you need to use external tools for assembly (and assembly is not something you want to cut your teeth on unless you have no choice).</p>
<p>However, one thing to note is that you are NOT going to be able to reuse TI-BASIC skills on any other platform.  TI-BASIC is peculiar to TI's offerings only, and it is appropriate for a calculator - that is to say, not all that sophisticated.  You'd be doing this for a) personal curiosity, and b) developing overall concepts, e.g. what an IF-THEN-ELSE structure is for.  There will be a learning curve when you transition to something more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Once you get your hands on something better, I would consider C, JavaScript, or Java (distinct from JavaScript).  JavaScript is probably the most forgiving of the three and is part of any major web browser, Java runs anywhere, and C lets you see how the computer really works in all its glory (if you want to call it glory, some would call it horror).</p>
<p>If you want further recommendations, I suggest that you give us ideas of what you do have access to.  Is the TI-84 literally the only computing device you have?  Do you have an Android smart phone?  Do you have a PC of almost any stripe (and if so can you give general specs)?  Telling us what other resources - or that you have no other resources - would be helpful.  Simply saying &quot;I have a TI 84&quot; does not indicate if that's all you've got, end of story.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I dont want to do Python yet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was going to to be my answer. There really isn't a language that is easier to learn than Python. I really don't understand what you would want to do before Python. Maybe something like javascript could be easier, but I consider that to barely qualify as a full programing language. It certainly isn't as useful as Python.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You should learn object oriented programming first.</p>
<p>So start with Java or C#.</p>
<p>Java runs on everything, IDEs are available for free and for every OS and you can learn the basics of OO Programming with it.</p>
<p>C# is the nicer language than Java, but you won't find as much help and resources for it as for Java.</p>
<p>Just avoid C++ and C, because C++ is a mess (very unclean but powerful language) and C can't teach you OO (but it's cool for low level stuff).</p>
<p>There are good free eBooks for many languages, so pick one that is for beginners.</p>
<p>Don't read too fast but instead use the stuff you learn a lot before you proceed to the next chapters, be sure you understand it.</p>
<p>Make little projects, really simple ones. At first without a GUI, just try to read a sudoku from a file and solve it in text mode, and similar stuff.</p>
<p>Later, you can try building GUIs and probably start with a simple calculator or text editor.</p>
<p>Little Games are also nice projects, but keep it simple at first.</p></div>
