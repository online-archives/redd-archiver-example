Anyhow at work I use Windows and would like to use Icecat but it's not really working out so hot. I installed Visual Studio and various other requirements per the Mozilla Windows build instructions, but it's not really matching what I'm seeing. There was a batch script included with the source so I figure why not try that, &quot;start-shell.bat&quot; and it exited with this error:</p>
<pre><code>
U:\Users\elementalpee&gt;IF &quot;0&quot; == &quot;1&quot; (START U:\Users\elementalpee\Downloads\icecat-52.3.0-gnu1\ic
ecat-52.3.0\msys\bin\mintty -e U:\Users\elementalpee\Downloads\icecat-52.3.0-gnu1\icecat
-52.3.0\msys\bin\console U:\Users\elementalpee\Downloads\icecat-52.3.0-gnu1\icecat-52.3.
0\msys\bin\bash --login )  ELSE (U:\Users\elementalpee\Downloads\icecat-52.3.0-gnu1\icec
at-52.3.0\msys\bin\bash --login -i )
The system cannot find the path specified.
</code></pre>
<p>Near as I can figure, it's looking to see if I have some kind of &quot;mintty&quot; thing, determining that I don't, and then instead trying to run some kind of bash shell. It is true what it says when it says it can't find it. There is no such &quot;msys&quot; folder in the icecat-52.3.0 folder.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how I ought to proceed from here? Am I barking up the wrong tree with this batch script to begin with?</p>
<p>Edit: Not sure if it's relevant but I'm trying from Win 7 Enterprise 64.</p></div>
