<p>I have to admit that they somehow have an idiot in charge of that company because first they pulled the Adobe Creative Cloud trick on their developers (subscription).

    <div class="md"><p>Your confusion about the languages in .NET isn't exactly encouraging. No offense, but PHP is kind of the lowest of the low when it comes to programming. It sounds like you need to invest some time in educating yourself about Java/.NET before you just try to jump into a job with either of those. Otherwise the interview will probably be kind of embarrassing. If those languages are too challenging or different, consider doing more research into front-end languages/frameworks and get a job somewhere doing that (HTML/CSS/JS).</p></div>
