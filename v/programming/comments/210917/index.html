I go to a university to study &quot;Computer Technology with a concentration of Computer Networking&quot;. I have zero faith that this degree will get me anywhere with the courses they're making me take. After searching for internships, a lot of them won't even acknowledge me because I'm lacking programming experience. I have very limited knowledge of programming languages. Basic ideas and concepts, but no useful experience. I dabbled in HTML in highschool. Learned some JavaScript, but wasn't efficient at it. I took a class on Python, but is that even useful in this day and age?</p>
<p>I really have no idea what programming language to start practicing and learning that will help me in the future with a career. Anyone have any suggestions? My interest is really in computer networking, so I'm looking for something that can assist that.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm only a student myself, but if you are going to learn C you might as well d C++ too. Not a the same time though. One then the other.</p>
<p>Personally I would recommend C first because I imagine moving from C to C++ has to be one of the top 10 best feelings in the world, but going the other way is like a slow decent into madness.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Ruby is mostly for web dev not much else learned that the hard way.  c is old school.  Perl is pretty good for  networking based on what i did of 5 mins of googling. Heard it also has a good libraries  for networking, so just be careful it should be based off of what you wan't. I found C++ archaic so avoid that if your a  beginner and I don't think there are many job opportunities for it. </p></div>
