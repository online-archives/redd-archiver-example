<p>look up 'cyanogenmod' to read their story of fail. Including but not limited to, conning a chinese manufacturer into announcing a partnership with CM and leaving it to them to do the work, and CM quickly shitting bricks when they couldnt steal code from anywhere else for new hardware to complile and label as their own, and the chinese brand quickly and quietly wising on to it and dropping them like hot shit.</p>
<p>they then rebranded to.... lineageOS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all your phone's bootloader needs to be unlockable. Check that this is the case. If it is then continue, if not, you're shit outta luck.</p>
<p>If installing a custom ROM voids your phone's warranty, then I would wait, until your warranty expires.</p>
<p>If your warranty has already expired, then I would highly recommend it. For me it's been running smoothly since it was Cyanogenmod. The idiot calling them &quot;script kiddies&quot; misses the point (I would like to hear how he uses his phone)... Cyanogenmod tried to commercialize and the main technical guy jumped ship to start lineage when the writing was on the wall, leaving the faggot CEO to drown in his wreckage. Lineage has avoided commercialization so far and seems dedicated to staying free and open-source. If not... well then there will be the another fork.</p>
<p>The good thing about it is that it allows you to completly remove anything from Google, as far as I can tell. Don't add google stuff, since that defeats the purpose. So no no google play store, no google play services. Install F-Droid for some useful apps, I'd recommend: 
- Amaze file browser
- Simple Calendar
- Simple Music Player
- FOSS Browser
- Markor (Markdown text editor)
- keepassDX (password manager)
- NewPipe (YouTube player and downloaded)
- Termux (for messing around with a terminal on your phone, you can actually write and run scripts to do stuff)
- The only good games are Shattered Pixel Dungeon, Solitaire and Chess
- Yalp store</p>
<p>OK so as you might have noticed the apps available through F-Droid don't quite cover everything... That's what Yalp store is for, it let's you download stuff from Google play store without needing a google account or google play services installed (some apps need it anyway, but I don't use any of those, so I don't care. There is a project that attempts to spoof google play services, but I haven't bothered with that). This is how I get the navigation apps &quot;Here&quot; (better for driving) and &quot;OSMAnd&quot; (better for hiking/cycling) which allow for offline map downloads. Then I begrudgingly download WhatsApp to communicate with normies compromising my entire setup (I keep the fucker off most of the time, I tell people it's to save bettery)... But at least no Google!</p>
<p>Follow the lineage wiki for your phone model to install. If you have installed an OS before or used the commandline, it should be easy, otherwise just go step-by-step, maybe watch a tutorial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it safe? And faster?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply yes. I get security updates that I wouldn't receive from the phone manufacturer. Without the google cancer my 4 year old phone works better than the first day I got it. My impulse for installing Cyanogenmod was when I noticed how my phone wouldn't work properly without google shit. It feels satisfying to remove that cancer and and regain a bit of independence.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've always had great battery life, but since that's just anecdotal, I decided to do a bit more searching and share my understanding of things...</p>
<p>Battery life depends on your usage and on the kernel. &quot;Stock android&quot; is the regular AOSP kernel+OS without optimal configuration for your phone. This can drain your battery. When compiling Android, it's possible to add configurations to optimize battery usage and performance for a specific phone. Phone manufacturer's do this to some extent with the kernel+OS preinstalled on their phones (then usually they add google and other bloatware).</p>
<p>For any supported phone, People involved with Lineage OS compile a kernel with optimizations for that phone (+ the rest of the OS to go with it). For the most part, I'm sure those people have some idea what they are doing and the kernel should be fine performance/battery wise.</p>
<p>You can compile a kernel with your own configurations and add a custom ROM. Maybe this way it's possible to squeeze a bit more out of your phone (performance by overclocking; battery by putting the phone in a &quot;deeper sleep&quot; when not in active use by limiting CPU cycles, signals etc.) but it sounds like a whole lotta effort to find out what do actually do with potential to brick your phone. You can also find custom kernels that other people have created, just look up &quot;yourPhone custom kernel&quot; and you should be able to find stuff on XDA and other sites, where surely bad kernels would be pointed out by otgers and removed.</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother with the effort, but it seems good to know that's an option. Even if the battery usage was slightly worse by the kernel... you certainly gain battery by limiting background activity for apps and removing google + other bloatware. Regardless of battery, the removal of cancer and the buttery smooth experience I've had so far with Lineage are what make it totally worth it, in my experience. The installation is a little tricky, but after that it's smooth sailing.</p>
<p>If you aren't convinced on Lineage:</p>
<p><a href="[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions#Table_of_ROMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions#Table_of_ROMs)">Here's a list of custom ROMs.</a> If you look at the number of supported devices, you'll see why Lineage is popular... Supposedly Copperhead has more of a security focus (at the expense of usability probably) and Resurrection Remix (based on Lineage) is even more configurable (but do you really want more buttons?).</p>
<hr />
<p>Again Disclaimer to prevent disappointment: first wait for your warranty to expire + check if your bootloader is unlockable.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless your phone is loaded with bloatware, no, and if it is then just root your phone with vanilla android. If you're trying to get away from Google, LineageOS won't take you there. They're completely cucked for Google.</p>
<p>LineageOS fully expects you to install Google Play Services. The alternative is microG, something that LineageOS doesn't even support. So if you expect you phone to be able to do basic shit you need Google play services. Don't believe me? Spend a day trying to root LineageOS on the thing, don't install Google play services, and see if you make it a week before thinking &quot;holy fuck a lot of Android isn't open source anymore it's all in Google play services.&quot;</p></div>
