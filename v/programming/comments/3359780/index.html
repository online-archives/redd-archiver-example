<p>There are multiple ways to achive this goal it seems.  And multiple people could do it independently using different techniques. </p>
<p>My questions to the programming group: </p>
<p>* If mirrors were setup and refreshed well enough to act as a read-only temporary location, would it help alleviate the DDOS attacks? Would the presence of live mirrors thwart the incentive for DDOS? I think it would, but I'd like your input</p>
<p>* If mirrors can be used to thwart the incentive for DDOS, are there downsides to having these mirrors setup? </p>
<p>If it's only a matter of buying a domain name like www.myVOATmirror.com and <a href="https://hostingfacts.com/hosting-reviews/dreamhost/">hosting package from Dreamhost</a> to make mirroring a pushbutton operation, I think it is likely we can get a few people to do this exercise.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Mirrors will go down as well.</p>
<p>Technically, CloudFlare (Voat is hosted on it, or its sitting in front of the actual Voat server) is a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Putt also has anti-DDOS options turned on, which is why you see the &quot;Checking your privilege&quot; screen. </p>
<p>Unless you're going to do the same, and spend a decent amount of money, your site will go offline in seconds and you'll either be shut down for an entire month of bandwidth or have a very large bill for overages.</p>
<p>Putt's making attempts at pushing off the attacks and this happens at least once a year. Unless you really want to spend your money on hosting and anti-ddos options, let Putt handle it. It sucks but each time they do this, he learns other sneaky ways to stay online a little longer. Technically he could turn this whole thing into read-only and use something like Memcached, but that just defeats the purpose of us talking. I'm guessing it's why we saw (at least I did) &quot;this is a cached copy&quot; message during the day yesterday or such.</p>
<p>Source: I delete my accounts once in a while and have been here since Pao pulled her crap on Reddit a few years ago, this isn't my first rodeo here. I'm also a computer security guy.</p>
<p>Edit: Stupid letters sneaking in when they shouldn't.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Forgive my ignorance, but why would mirrors go down as well? I don't understand why you think an attack on CloudFlare would somehow impact non CloudFare sites.  A cursory search on DreamHost's site (I'm not recommending them, just referencing them for this exercise) <a href="https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215873088-CloudFlare-overview">shows that CloudFare &quot;optimization&quot; is both optional and a paid-for add-on</a>.   So one can setup a mirror without CloudFlare. </p>
<p>As a mirror creator, I don't even need to mirror the whole site. I could mirror my favorite 10 subverses.  Another user can mirror their favorite subverses. </p>
<p>DreamHost (again just referencing, not recommending) offers &quot;Virtual Private Server&quot; hosting with unlimited bandwidth for 10 federal reserve notes a month.  Why wouldn't such a hosting plan be sufficient for this purpose? </p>
<p>Not trying to be argumentative or disrespectful. Just honestly looking for a reason why a read-only mirror would need anything more than something simple like I'm proposing.  
</p>
<p>Yes I am suggesting I can spend my own money on hosting this.  What I'm wondering is whether there are technical or other barriers which would thwart this effort, or other reasons why it may not work.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It's about bandwidth. </p>
<p>You get a certain amount of bandwidth available to you with any hosting package. The &quot;unlimited&quot; packages are limited on the CPU/Memory side. Such a DDoS will nuke your bandwidth and make your server use up all that memory and CPU. Thus, you'd get kicked for abuse.</p>
<p>I'm not saying &quot;no, you can't&quot;, but more &quot;you shouldn't&quot; and it's more for your resources. </p>
<p>On top of that, your requests from the same IP, even if slow, without account activity may show up as an attacker since you'd be coming from a hosting farm. The worst DDoS' come from computers that are taken over and they fully look like standard visitors. Since Putt nuked entire net ranges of countries, they were probably from bots running on machines in those areas. This time, I haven't a clue as I haven't caught up on the latest post nor will he give much info (as he shouldn't).</p>
<p>And no offense taken. I'm just trying to save you some money.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I'm interested in hosting, but I live in an area with unlimited gigabit business fiber with static IP for about $100/month. They allow for web hosting. A reasonable server running Linux/Apache with 64 gigs of RAM would probably take some effort to thwart. Be a good opportunity to honeypot the attackers IP's and post some logs online to see if we can pinpoint where the attacks are coming from.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Geoblocking is tricky business.  Yes, can be done, but it's based on registered IP blocks - doesn't always apply to the real world, and he's getting hammered from 5 different regions (minimum, right ?) .. and if it's IoT like dude suggested above then .. you can't keep ahead of it easily.  You can Whitelist Canada, USA, UK, Australia, Western European Countries .. but the list becomes ungainly pretty quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you had the money (BIG) and ran Oracle db servers I could set up a fail safe network for you, that fails over to a (possible) string of parallel db's on different hardware using different network resources, that these nerds would have to chase down, while you repaired what they've already done in their wake. Dunno if SQL server can do that. In fact you could make it (given sufficient resources) so that their attacks are invisible/transparent to the users (a chase).</p>
<p>Don't you even have the source (authentic) IP's this is coming from? Can't you just ban them and move on? Are they making bots out of innocent users via virus software? Couldn't you just send notice that we scan (scan regularly) for particular virus or a range of them?</p>
<p>HOW sophisticated are these turds? Constantly writing custom virus's or is it just off the shelf shit that the pussy boy douchebags use?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>There exists such a solution. <a href="https://notabug.io">notabug</a> is designed to be automatically mirrored.</p>
<p>You can do a mirror with Dreamhost (or just wget -m) but it will be a static site.   
</p>
<p>To create a fully functional mirror of voat, you'd need the database and the up-to-date source code.  Putt might not prefer to share that with somebody else, since he has invested considerable amount of his money and resources on this website.</p></div>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/u/puttitout">@puttitout</a> is it ok to create a static mirror of voat?  Can I download the whole site or would you consider it an abuse?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>What about just trying your favorite 10 subverses? If these are distributed backups, different people can have different subverses backed up.   They don't necessarily need to try to capture all of VOAT.   
</p>
<p>Good question to Putt - hopefully captures with appropriate timers in place won't be considered abuse.</p></div>
