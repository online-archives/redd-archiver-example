<blockquote>
<p>Scrum Master</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dude lists that on his resume... I would throw that out and burn the trash can and burry the ashes  as fast as I could too....  then he piles on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>....assigned me coding tests [...]  I rejected those tests </p>
</blockquote>
<p>why didn't they call him back?  I wonder...  and he carries on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I rejected the calls for interviews from these, too...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now that I am in my thirties, I am picky about my job. [...]  Unfortunately, the companies don’t understand that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes,  special snowflake,  they do understand that very well;  why hire a picky prima dona with an inflated ego,  when you can hire kids fresh off college who'll churn out code just as fast,  for a fraction of the cost and without the attitude?</p></div>

<p>Wooo, that may explain it. You have been brainwashed into developing a bad coding habit that will end up with 100% failed projects.</p>
<p>You paid a lot of money to snakes oil sellers: &quot;Do these steps and you will become the best developer of the world&quot;. Sad reality is that you have been trained in quackery and bad coding habits. And you will never be able to unclear these bad coding habits. You became a code monkey, lost any creativity to bring software projects home and successfully.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough everybody is now following for SCRUM master and it does not add anything of value to your resume now. You are just a cog like the other 1000 cogs in the wheel. As a developer you don't have unique qualities that the others does not have. There is no reason to hire you because they have choice of 1000 other developers that knows the exact same thing as you.</p>
<p>Now how do you get out of there? Kick the SCRUM methodology out, it only slows you down. Learn something others don't know. Take something that has a higher learning curve and challenges your creativity. Don't become the slave of frameworks, take control become the master of your own framework.</p>
<p>I had unique chances to work inside SCRUM teams and outside, work in enterprise environments and in small companies. SCRUM cripples my productivity to about 10%. Enterprise environment between 30-50% depending on the team leader. Small company I work 120% productivity.</p></div>
