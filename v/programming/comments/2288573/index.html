    <div class="md"><p>I'd kind of welcome that, but I've just recently decided to join the Mobile Revolution and do a fair portion of my computing on a tablet. I've been at it for almost a year. It's actually kind of horrible - but I told myself I'd try to join the mobile world and so I've gone through four tablets and finally settled on an iPad. I am considering getting a Surface and slapping Lubuntu on it. I'd get a bluetooth keyboard, but that kind of defeats the point of having a tablet.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it over and over again... They always think that the other side will solve all problems. And every single time they end up having the exact same failure, just slightly different problems. There is no one single solution that fits all. It always comes down to that one developer in your team that has enough creativity to bring your project home. </p>
<p>I like this Webassembly, because it means that the learning curve is very steep and it increases my demand. It is a path script kiddies can't reach :-)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn't part of the advantage of WebAssembly that you can write your program in most popular languages and then it is compiled to the WA byte code for execution? How will this make it a tougher learning curve? Debugging will probably be a bitch if you're not used to it, I suppose.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>So is everyone going to hate on it like they did with Microsoft's ActiveX technology? It's tragically funny to me to see everything MS did back in the early days of the web and were ridiculed for have come back in some new fashion and embraced as the &quot;next big thing&quot;. MS gave us IE specific CSS and people freaked out. Webkit and Mozilla did it too and it was cheered on. MS gave us the Structured Graphics Control to display vector graphics in the browser. Everyone hated it. SVG in the browser and suddenly it's okay. Nothing is new and this &quot;innovation&quot; is just as bad as anything before it, but hey, let's be hypocrites and embrace it when it's no better than ActiveX, JAVA or Flash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is that these technologies and standards are open. These don't need a proprietary browser. These can be implemented by anyone who has the means to do so. These are specs that are open for everyone.</p>
<p>Therein lies the difference.</p>
<p>Well, so I understand the complaints. I don't have a nickel invested.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>They claim to be open, but the reality is they are still controlled by the original developer/company. It's like the whole HTML5 video in the browser thing. Do you have the ability to go and change the source of Chrome or Firefox to replace the codecs with ones of your choosing? Sure you could fork it, but is that really any different than just making another competing browser? Open Source has proven to be anything but open. It's become a term that has lost its original intended meaning and the FOSS community is a ragtag mess of competing ports, distros and dead end projects. The idea of Open Source was grand and noble and I was a big proponent of it. The idealism gave way to the stark reality where we sacrificed innovation and forward thinking for &quot;stop complaining it's free and if you don't like it, go fork it yourself&quot;. Now we have bloated browsers, shitty office apps that haven't improved in 10 years and the Gimp which is still crap. Linux has endless distros that compete for popularity points but always wait to see what MS does next instead of blazing trails. I'm no MS fan these days but fuck the FOSS world has made me wish we had strong closed source competition again. There was real innovation when money was on the line. We need that again.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've been good in software for 30 years but there's no way for one programmer to topple Mount Open Source with its misguided proponents and megacorporations funneling money into bad technologies. The momentum and entrenchment for this bullshit is too great and the problem really begins with the OS and hardware platforms so I would have to create a new unfucked processor, a new OS, a new OS API, a new compiler, a new language, a new set of protocols and finally a new browser with new programming interfaces. What you're saying is equivalent to making your own new government and nation that no one will recognize as sovereign or emigrate to because you have nothing substantial to work with and no army to force your ways. If you can pull all of this off, well I'll gladly do those other things and give your nation a better alternative to WebASM.</p></div>
