      <div class="md"><p>I need to vent. I'm procrastinating working on this small program I've inherited to finish that I'm going to have to completely re-write. This industry has become a meme and so many people are trying to get into this field who should not and cannot be professional, productive programmers. I'm 1 year into my career so far and I'm working at a small business. I worked with 1 other guy in-house who is no longer here and it sucked working with him. He was related to the owner and he was simply bad in every way. </p>
<ul>
<li>Loud, obnoxious, constantly swearing while trying to get something to work. Under your breath is fine, shit is frustrating sometimes, but constantly saying &quot;bitch... bitch... bitch... goddamnit... what the FUCK... mother FUCKER... fucking UHHHHHH&quot;. Shut the fuck up cunt. Yes, I tried to tell him to relax because I'm trying to concentrate, no he didn't give a shit.</li>
<li>0 sense of professional demeanor and soft skills, would post embarrassing shit in slack when communicating with our contractor. Our manager never trusted him to communicate with clients.</li>
<li>He just graduated with a comp sci degree, and I'm self-taught, so when we first started, he would try to pair program with me and look over my shoulder to &quot;help&quot; me when I was falling behind. Our manager has no experience managing programmers so he thought this was a good idea. No, this is a terrible idea, and it would stress me out when I just needed to concentrate and study the code without some dickhead looking over my shoulder and even occasionally insulting me. </li>
<li>Constantly promising things were almost done, or even telling our manager something was done when it hasn't been tested (when a bug would inevitably crop up). &quot;Almost done&quot; is a meaningless fucking statement. </li>
<li>Would scoff at basic OOP principles and clean code principles. He thought everything was stupid and pointless. Those were his go-to words to describe everything in software design. Stupid. Pointless. </li>
<li>Didn't seem to know basic OOP at all when we started. I specifically remember one time I was explaining something and he remarked, &quot;I hate all these stupid names that mean the same thing, you're talking about a class.&quot; I was talking about an interface and he thought an interface was the same thing as a class or something. I don't even know. Fuck.</li>
<li>Refused to use helper/utility functions from libraries and instead wanted to reinvent the wheel randomly. &quot;That's stupid, why use that then when I can just ______.&quot; Didn't understand that his poorly written code was in fact, not doing the same thing as the method from that very helpful library.</li>
<li>Never looked at source code to figure out what was going on. If he got stuck, time to bother our contractor for an answer, or just be completely lost.</li>
<li>Occasionally took credit for things I did. </li>
<li>Didn't own up to bugs he would create. Just blamed the codebase for being stupid and overly complicated with all these nonsense classes and such. </li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like his presence soured our relationship with our contractor. The guy was braindead and unprofessional and I could tell it stressed out our main contact who also trained us for 2 months. I always tried to be professional, do my best, and respect the craft, but sometimes I felt like when our contractor was talking to me, he was being condescending and dismissive. Just not interested in communication period. When he did code reviews, he initially tried to be thorough but I could tell he started giving up and only cared that we tested changes on QA so nothing obvious would break on the website. </p>
<p>Towards the last month this dickhead was here, he started getting very angry and aggressive, and we almost got into a physical fight at one point. He kept pulling me away from what I was working on to help him because his task was more important than mine and got mad at me for not pair programming with him. I reached a breaking point and fucking had it with this mother fucker and blew up on him about it. He showed up to work less and less after that and finally quit. Lasted about 8 months. </p>
<p>I have inherited a project he was working on and my manager wants me to finish. It's a little microservice with about a 1000 lines. I have no idea what's going on in this thing. Lots of meaningless variable names, and the entire application is in 1 class with 5 methods. It's a bunch of if-statements and for-loops, and my IDE is highlighting a bunch of lines warning me about duplicated code lol. </p>
<p>What the fuck are they teaching in universities anyway? How the fuck do you earn your computer science degree and do everything I described above? </p>
<p>I'm going to stop procrastinating on voat and go re-write this thing now.</p>
<p>Share your stories of working with bad programmers in this thread.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Slash, burn, restart from scratch after consulting with whatever stakeholder / BA is needing the project on the business side.</p>
<p>Don't worry.  That guy left, will get re-hired somewhere else in no time because developers are in such short supply everywhere, and he will immediately begin telling everyone at the new place how terrible the old place was.  I can already hear the complaints of how he was being held back by incompetence at his last gig and how he was the only one keeping the place afloat.  There will be prognostications of how your company will shortly go under because he left.</p>
<p>I've heard it all before, I'll hear it all again.  I'm actually hearing it now from a guy whom we hired six months ago.  That's just how it be, though.</p>
<p>Just remember that a Comp. Sci. degree means someone understood computer science well enough to get a degree.  Do not make the mistake that many people make and assume that Computer Science as an academic discipline has anything at all to do with on-the-ground software development.</p>
<p>Comp. Sci. is a mathematical discipline.  Actual software development is basically the blue-collar work of the white-collar world.  It's technical, but it has way more in common with jobs like electrician and plumber than it does with any mathematical discipline (in most shops).</p>
<p>If I knew then what I know now, I would have skipped the Comp. Sci. degree and just went straight to work.</p></div>

<p>Try not to get too angry. Work on your own professional development including soft skills. You will soon learn your value compared to others and should be able to turn that into higher and higher salaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm mostly self taught, and a colleague in my Electrical Engineering classes was having troubles with their C++ class. So, I offered to help. I taught them more about programming in a couple of hours, than they were able to pick up in 2 months of that class. After sitting down with me, they were basically able to teach themselves the entire rest of the course, completely disregarding the teacher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That's a rewrite. </p>
<p>First year programmers have an idealistic view of how the code should be, that it should adhere to a university orthodoxy, and have no concept that the customer absolutely does not care at all about that. So businesses do whatever.</p>
<p>Contractors have a vested interest in the code being a continually breaking mess, to perpetuate income.</p>
<p>Absolutely learn not to have interpersonal conflicts, it's just a job.</p>
<p>One common personality type includes being judgemental.</p></div>

<p>stories of working with bad programmers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just stories about programmers.</p>
<p>Now, a story about a <em>good</em> programmer?</p>
<p>That's what we call lies.</p>
<p>Now, I could give you stories about programmers, going back to the days before the internet existed and all of our workstations looked way more futuristic than they do today, when real men wrote real code according to real specs that had been generated through six real months of real meetings that really happened and cocaine, but instead I will go beyond that and give you a generalised algorithm that will allow you to generate your own stupid-IT-cow-worker stories in the comfort of your own gamer chair.</p>
<pre><code>foreach (coworker) {
    if (coworker.style != self.style)
        put BAD_PROGRAMMER;
    if (coworker.preferredlang != self.preferredlang)
        put BAD_PROGRAMMER;
    if (coworker.computerskills() == 0)
        put BAD_PROGRAMMER;
    if (coworker.preferrededitor != self.preferrededitor)
        die $error //TODO swear eternal vengeance; see his line ended; bathe in the blood of his relatives
    }
    GOTO alcoholism;
</code></pre>
<p>There, now you too can feel like an <em>IT Veteran</em> - a veritable cybersamurai of the digital wasteland. Now all you need is to develop strong feelings about vim and then you're practically a grognard. And Mike, if you bring down the servers at three in the morning on a saturday again because you and your shitty macbook tried to push an update straight into production, I am going to take my car, and crash it into your fucking house.</p></div>

<p>Loud, obnoxious, constantly swearing while </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not your fault, it's a management fail. 1 programmer = 1 office, or your
company leaves a lot of money on the table. He who manages a chip-factory
and puts the carpentry and the den with cats into the fab with the
high-purity filters makes himself the laughing stock of the industry.
He who manages a programming factory and jams thinkers into cubicles
makes himself a model of frugality for some reason. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our manager never trusted him to communicate with clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart manager. Gifted engineers often suck with people. That's why
incellism is so epidemic among prodigy programmers. You will have
difficulty using a modern formula-1 race car in a dirt-track competition. 
Lock programmers in the basement and make sure they never see clients
or female employees, not even at lunch. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>pair program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Might yield good results occasionally, but as a way of programming
it drives most people into contemplating suicide or leaving for a
company without pair programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Almost done&quot; is a meaningless fucking statement. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a piggy-bank for quarters in meetings. He who says &quot;now, that's
totally easy&quot; or &quot;almost done&quot; pays a quarter as a penalty. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stupid. Pointless. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Might be on to something; hard to tell without specifics. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>he thought an interface was the same thing as a class</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OOP is probably overrated for Non-UI code, but that gap in his knowledge
is indeed a red flag. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didn't understand that his poorly written code was 
in fact, not doing the same thing as the 
method from that very helpful library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your library? I'm not trying to piss you off, but often
a maternal view is unhelpful. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he got stuck, time to bother our contractor for 
an answer, or just be completely lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source code is only marginally easier to comprehend than a
hex-listing of machine code. Documentation solves most problems
if it is taken seriously and not as a hoop to jump through for
audits. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally took credit for things I did. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OMG punch his face in minesweeper. Unironically very bad style, 
probably a criminal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didn't own up to bugs he would create. Just blamed the 
codebase for being stupid and overly complicated with all 
these nonsense classes and such. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have seen shit like that where every one, including the authors,
agreed that that was indeed the state of the matter. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have inherited a project he was working on </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could be worse. Most of the time, the idiot who cobbled together some
crock of entropy that blows a fuse upon all edge-cases is the smart, efficient
worker-bee and you, who is later supposed to fix &quot;a few problems&quot; with
very slow progress due to clarity-fails, obfuscation, stack-exchange pasta
and cargo cult is the retarded under-achiever and low-potential. </p>
<p>You are totally right in that the software &quot;industry&quot; is fundamentally
broken, even without obnoxious work-mates.</p></div>
