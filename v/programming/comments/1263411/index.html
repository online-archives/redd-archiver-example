<p>There still are, but gets outnumber by less experienced people that will try to make their work even harder to complete. We are at a point where the new developers and project managers have no clue anymore what the experienced people are doing so they are fighting the people that are saving their projects. </p>
<p>It is heart breaking to see generations of new developers that have have mis-learned by these boot camps that will leave trails of failed projects in the years to come. It will eventually become better, but we have now 1 or 2 generations that will fail in their IT career. Once mis-learned it can never be undone.</p></div>
