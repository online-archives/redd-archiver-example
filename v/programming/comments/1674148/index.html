Therefore I am not extremely deep into the matter, but I know my way around code and some architectural concepts, encryption concepts, I can tell the difference between imperative programming and functional programming etc., you get the jizzed.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there are any postgraduate/masters degrees in the field of computerscience (preferably in Europe) that you can do even if your bachelor is not strictly technical. I'm not really seeking to be &quot;more employable&quot; or anything, I don't care about what those bootcamps promise, I'm way more interested in a curious and academic approach. Is there something like this around? I have been googling this for a couple of months now, but no luck :(</p>
<p>Any hints much appreciated, fuck you very much!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree and I have done that to a certain extent and I am actually quite glad I am getting my degree in a wishy-washy field, because there you really need a degree to &quot;prove&quot; you &quot;know&quot; your shit. But I am not as much interested in learning how to code in ES6 or how to make a facebook clone in Ruby, I want the explore lower abstraction levels or like say the Lambda calculus and why the fuck this is apparently so very useful for science.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to have a useful degree go for electronics. Great for science because now you can create your own sensor network using ESP-12 modules to create sensor networks. </p>
<p>Even though I don't like IoT because there is no reason why my fridge should be connected to the Internet, you can create local networks (using a second wifi router that is disconnected from the Internet). </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to explore lambda calculus the best languages to pursue are probably purely functional ones such as lisp and Haskell, though Python has very good support for lambda functions (<code>lambda x: x</code>), and ES6 JavaScript makes it easier to use lambda functions with the new arrow function syntax (<code>() =&gt; {}</code>).</p>
<p>My personal recommendation if you choose to explore lambda calculus through code is to just pick a language and start a personal side project with the purpose of solving a random problem. Let's say you want to create a fractal generator. Just start writing code in your language of choice, get it to work, and then start tinkering to see what works better or worse.</p>
<p>When I tinker I like to mess around with the guts of the internals to see if I can eke out an extra 0.1% performance or make future modifications to the program as a whole easier by introducing utility classes, because those are the things that interest me most. This usually means that when I've finished tinkering with something I have to do a major refactoring of everything that influences, though.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I have tried Haskell, but I haven't come far, I do however use arrow functions in my new js, also I do love to challenge myself on codewars and I have solved quite some katas (just to be blown away by the optimal solutions). I also have a github account with some side projects on it that would prove to people that I know at least <em>something</em>. So you too think I don't <em>need</em> a formal thingy if I just keep learning? </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on my experience, yes. What most programmers look for in a new hire isn't necessarily their degree or even how well they did in school, but how passionate or knowledgeable they are about the subject of programming. I only graduated from college with a 2.9 GPA, but because I tinkered and worked on side projects, I was able to give answers to questions that weren't just memorized from books, but from my own experience.</p></div>
