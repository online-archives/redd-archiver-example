      <div class="md"><p>I have [this asignment]( due today and I really just don't get how to do this at all I've been studying while loops but I'm really struggling here, please help.</p>
<p>Project 4
Objective: 
The purpose of this lab project is to expose you to Loops, enforce functions, proper use of by-value/by reference, and to expand your skills in writing larger/more sophisticated programs. </p>
<p>Problem Specification:<br />
The Passaic County Contracting Company, PCCC, negotiates building projects/job contracts. For each contract, the company have to subcontract an electrician to do the electrical, a plumber to do the pluming, a roofer to do the roofing, and a landscaper to do the landscaping. All other work is done internally by their employees. For each project they assign a minimum of 5 employees who are paid salary that varies from employee to employee. The company orders and pays for material which consists of wood, concrete, windows, doors, sheetrock and spackle. </p>
<p>As the programmer for PCCC, they assigned you the task of writing a C++ program to accept the number of the projects/jobs that PCCC has won. 
For each job, the program should accept:
The amount of the contract
The amount they paid each subcontractor.
For internal work:
 The salary for each of the employees working on the project, is entered as input until the sentinel 0 is entered (the number of employees is unknown but a minimum of 5).
The cost of the material for each of the items listed above.
For each contract the program should output to a file, the amount of the contract, the cost of the contract, and the profit/loss from the contract.
At the end, the program will output, to the same file:
 the total electrical cost, total plumbing cost, total roofing cost, total landscaping cost, total cost for material and total cost for salaries for all contracts
it then outputs to the same file, the total of all contracts, the cost for all contracts, and the profit/loss for all contracts. </p>
<p>Requirements:	
Comment as needed.
All functions have specifications.
All data is passed by value / by reference as appropriate.
Main is the driver function, hardly any statements other than function calls, may appear in main.
Calculate all totals as requested.
Write the report to a file with proper headings, identifications … etc.</p>
<p>Hints:	
Be sure to initialize your totals and grand totals appropriately.
Keep running totals and grand totals between different contracts.</p>
<p>Grading criteria:
1. 5   points
Documentation, every function has a detailed specification.
2. 5   points
Proper spacing, comments, use of variables, general program appearance.
3. 5   points
Functions are self-contained, and accomplishes their tasks<br />
4. 5   points 
main() is used as driver, contains no statements, just function calls.
5. 8   points
A loop is used to run as many times as the number of contracts
6. 7   points
A sentinel loop to enter employees' salaries is used correctly.
7. 5   points 
Appropriate pass by value and pass by reference.
8. 5   points 
Only needed variables are passed between functions, otherwise they are local. 
9. 5   points
Accumulators and  counters are initialized appropriately
10. 5   points
A flowchart of the function main is handed-in and is correct.
11. 5   points
Hierarchical chart showing all functions and relationships is included and is correct.
12. 10 points
All specified totals are calculated and printed clearly.
13. 15 points
Program runs correctly and produces the intended results.
14. 5   points
Input data is submitted.
15. 5   points
Report is neat, clear, and wit appropriate titles.
16. 5   points
Output file is printed and handed in.</p>
<p>Submission Details:
Submit a print-out of:
The source file
Flowchart (for main() only)
Hierarchical chart
A copy of your input data
A copy of the output file.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>iostream for in/out streams <br />
fstream for creating/saving files   
</p>
<p>contractor.h/c is what you create to make the object of each contractor so that you don't have to heavily rely on functions.  
</p>
<p>so in the object you state:  
</p>
<p>class Contractor{</p>
<p>public: <br />
[put accessible parameters here]</p>
<p>private: <br />
[put fixed parameters here]</p>
<p>public: <br />
[insert ALL prototypes for parameters] <br />
}</p>
<p>then in your C file make the functions for the public parameters.  
</p>
<p>Now you made the object you can use them as &quot;regular&quot; namespaces   
</p>
<p>For example:   
</p>
<p>class SexObject{
public:
   void Vagina( int cocks);   
</p>
<p>private:
   float brain[];
}</p>
<p>in the C file   
</p>
<p>void SexObject::Vagina( int cocks){
  if(cocks) <br />
        {
          Other::Woman = Shut_down();
        }    
</p>
<p>In the main file   
</p>
<p>int cocks = 1; <br />
SexObject.Vagina(cocks);
//Is she quiet? <br />
if(woman==shut_down){
  cout&lt;&lt;&quot;All is good&quot;&lt;&lt;endl; <br />
else
  cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Cock required&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;<br />
get.man();</p></div>

<p><a href="https://pastebin.com/uEq4VSi8">https://pastebin.com/uEq4VSi8</a></p>
<p>Fyi be careful copying this. The prof will notice if my code uses techniques that you have not learned yet. There are many ways to do the input for this project as well. I assume you have only learned cin / cout, but you may want to refactoring using an input file or  argv. Hopefully this provides a good starting point. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the deal. 
This is VERY, VERY basic. It isn't going to get any easier. It's going to get much harder, soon. Buck up or become the 2/3rds college statistic. Stop slacking off, learn the shit, do the work, this plea for help is an embarrassment and could get you in deep trouble with your school if you continue, I would highly suggest you delete all traces of this and put your head down in your notes. </p>
<p>-Sincerely, a fellow college drop out</p>
<p>FYI I would have helped you if you had posted good code of a solid attempt but couldn't get it working. </p>
<p>As a starting point, rewrite this gibberish assignment into terms and math that are clear to understand, then put that math into code. That is the biggest thing stopping anyone from helping you more, it's just tedious and you need to do it. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone here told you about classes via sex references.  Someone else told you about includes. You should ignore both of these people.</p>
<p>The first line of the assignment indicates to me you are not really expected to be doing this with classes, but rather loops and functions. </p>
<p>Make a list of all the functions you think you'll need to do this, and start fleshing them out. You could of course do it all in one function, they are just to help you organize. You'll want a function for saving the file, collecting the order information, calculating it, displaying the results, etc.</p></div>

Mainly, taking a big problem and breaking into manageable pieces, tackling those pieces, and putting it all together. Problem solving is the real skill that you need to get through engineering or compsci degrees Most people fail because they are bad at solving complex problems, not because they can't grasp the underlying mathematics.</p></div>
