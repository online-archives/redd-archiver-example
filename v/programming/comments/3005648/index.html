    <div class="md"><p>The annoying thing with coding is that it is a 365.2422/7/24 none stop effort. You eat behind the PC, you drink behind the PC you even take your laptop to the toilet.  Blink and a 18 year old replaces your job because he is ahead of you. </p>
<p>The other thing is that 18 year old that just replaced you will be replaced 6 months or 1 year from now because he too becomes obsolete. So the world is creating one giant pile of throwaway developers that will end up in a burn out state and jump from a building.</p>
<p>Now the good news: Those developers that are on top of the food-chain and evolved while other developers gave up or jumped from a building will be the ones that companies need after they burned through the complete population. Those will become the new millionaires.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of that is true but it really takes nothing to get hired as a software developer these days.</p>
<p>If you can stand it to stare at a computer screen 6 hours a day 5 days a week, you're on par with half the developers that get hired. And of the ones who don't get hired but interview? Holy shit seriously so much money is wasted interviewing people who don't even know what a loop is. Worse than that once in a while one of them actually gets hired.</p>
<p>Scrum, which is this stupid methodology where basically you're only as good as your worst developer, just exacerbates the problem. Managers think it means they can hire lots of shit developers and it forces them to put their heads together. The software industry is seriously a disaster, it has been for decades.</p></div>

<p>Scrum is 15 minutes and must stick to just what is being worked on. If a discussion starts about a particular issue then it must be stopped or you end up with what happened to your team.</p>
<p>Other meetings include agile elements like back log grooming and retrospecs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not how software works. scrum is the most inefficient system  I have ever met. It prevents your good developers function as efficient as they can and having to lower their standard to your worst developer in your team.</p>
<p>Two years I worked in a team where you need 10 people to do exactly the same thing as one developer that does not use scrum. Thanks god they finally realized that it sucked and now we are back in the none-scrum mode and projects suddenly flourish without stress.</p>
<p>Scrum only benefits bad programmers into thinking that they are good. Scrum is like paint by numbers and then think that you created a Michelangelo.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you going on about????</p>
<p>Scrum uses JIRA or Azure DevOps (VSTS) to track bugs and features.</p>
<p>Scrum is just a 15 minute standup meeting basically.</p>
<p>Or are you going on about Velocity and the need to keep story points down so that sprints can be completed?</p>
<p>Sounds like those 2 years had a shit team instead of good developers or just a shitty ass project manager who couldn’t keep shit on track.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>On the contrary we are on a very efficient team only held to a crawling halt by the scrum methodology.</p>
<p>That 15 minute standup meeting is not scrum, that is only 1% of scrum. </p>
<p>And after 2 years all those in favor of scrum have left the projects. We finally have now the time to fix the crap and make it function in record time. Those user stories that is inefficient crap. Three weeks of sprint, and no way to respond fast and fix the thing that took ages. Without the scrum, ask us anything and within half a day or 2 days it is in. That is agile development, not that slow paced scrum sprint.</p>
<p>In the next weeks the very efficient functioning of our team that are now free from scrum will create shock-waves. More production, less bugs, faster development, better improvements, performant code. That is what you get when you use your developers at their peak capacity instead of this crappy use story related that cripples your developers and make them feel unhappy.</p>
<p>We are not restricted to the project manager anymore, we are faster than any project manager.</p></div>

<p>If a story was shot - blame the BA and product owners.</p>

We had even a personal scrum coach for a very long period. The funny thing is that when he took over to show us how it was done he failed miserably. Hahah</p>

<p>Without scrum, when we discover issues, or even finds new bugs in the code we can fix them instantly without having to go through an enormous waste of time through the sprints. 
With scrum we were forced to put a feature to done even buggy. Without scrum we put a feature done when it is ready and the quality is met.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>While I am not a professional programmer(a novice at best), I do think that it is wise for anyone to learn more than one way to eat. These journalist who have sucked the tit of mediocrity for so long, just to win brownie points from the masters guild of propaganda are receiving the rude awakening that they so desperately needed. Those who cannot improvise, adapt or overcome, should look elsewhere. Lets face it. There are few good journalist out there. The world needs a break from the incoherent  puke forced on us by the evil, sadistic hedonist that govern this shithole. learn to code indeed.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not how programming works. </p>
<p>1000 of typing monkeys does not create a good book.
Neither will 1000 scrum developers create one useful product.</p>
<p>The annoying thing about AI is that you have to teach what you want. 
So instead of programming you have to train it by telling what it should do. 
Imagine guiding 1000 typing monkeys to write a good book, they won't listen to you.</p>
<p>The other issue with AI is that AI can only create what it learned to create.
It becomes an less than average developer creating sub standard solutions.</p>
<p>Out in the real world with the #learntocode madness and scrum we have 100 out of 1 developers that are pure crap.
Good developers gets outnumbers by 100 bad developers that undo their programming.
Interesting is when a company is downsizing and fires most developer, the good developers suddenly becomes productive again.</p>
<p>AI assisting developers to create good programs faster is another ballgame.
A good developer can focus on what he wants to build and the AI is a glorified spell checker. </p>
<p>AI does not benefit in generating programs. We already have thousands of skins available for code that are exactly clones of each other.
There is nothing new the AI can create it already exists.</p>
<p>But a good developer can out of the blue invent new technology to create things that does not yet exist optimized for your company.
Good programmers can escape the box of limitations and create something new. I call it cheating because they bypass coding rules.</p>
<p>In addition when AI is thought wrong, it gets harder to get it back on track.</p>
<p>And yes I have been learning everything about AI the last 3 years to have a feeling what it is able to do.<br />
It is still really disappointing, and takes good developers to guide it to become somehow practical.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to look 2-8 years in the future.  AI is narrow now but it will not stay that way.  See unsupervised learning, adversarial methods, consciousness prior, day/night cycles, and more.  Imagine an AI that you can communicate with via webcam that is building as you talk to it.  That's where we are headed.  It's naive to think that humans will still be the ones crossing the semantic gap.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about journalists is that they are usually irrational types who took classes in college that were no more difficult than your average high school course.  Coders have to be intelligent, and good at analysis and problem solving.  A person's feelings about a problem simply don't matter and you don't get points for zealotry or having the latest must have moral beliefs.   It is kind of a funny joke to say that journalists should learn to code, but most are particularly ill-suited for it.</p></div>
