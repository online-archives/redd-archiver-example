    <div class="md"><p>I would suggest implementing something that already exists, just to learn how.  Most of programming (regardless language) consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a good understanding of what needs to be done/what you are trying to accomplish</li>
<li>Breaking the project down into manageable pieces.</li>
<li>Determining the best way to implement each piece in code (This will usually involve breaking the piece down in to even smaller pieces and implementing those)</li>
<li>Test each piece individually and debug as necessary.</li>
<li>Start coding the &quot;glue&quot; that ties the pieces together and debug as needed</li>
<li>As you get closer to completion, test the program as a whole.  Debug as needed</li>
<li>Ask others to test your program.  They WILL discover things you overlooked.  Debug those things</li>
<li>Test and tweak until you (or your users) are satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, pick a simple old video game like Pac-Man or Tetris and make yourself a clone.  It doesn't have to be perfect or even similar.  Just the exercise of figuring out all the steps you need to implement and how to tie them together into a working program will make you a better programmer in the long run.  Plus...it's fun!</p></div>

<p>I like your idea of the Who Am I game, but think I've settled on doing my podcast &quot;catcher&quot; app... I'll use it to download videos via RSS on my htpc, so it will give me real-world results.</p>
<p>Ideally I'm trying to get to a place where I am able to actually contribute to some open source projects that I'm interested in, but I don't feel like I'm there yet.</p>

<p>There are projects on github who specifically target &quot;newbies&quot;, by forbidding experienced developers to do the easy tasks. Since you have both Python and JavaScript on your list, <a href="http://pybee.org/contributing/first-time/">PyBee comes to mind</a>.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It has to be your idea, though. I just suggest music because it's a vague thing. If &quot;music player&quot; is what you come up with, you see? If it's me, my issue is that to start a project I tend to make a blank screen and stare at it with the comfort that it's blank and therefore no bugs in it, otherwise I'll cry because I kinda suck at making programs. </p></div>
