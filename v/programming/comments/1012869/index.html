    <div class="md"><p>...that's how I found happiness too;  however, OP has to realize that this is not really an option for a junior / entry level position (5 years experience is still that);  small companies expect a new hire to hit the ground running,  they can't afford much hand holding. </p>
<p>Another contributor mentioned participating in some open source project :  that's an excellent suggestion;   that and some years of experience will open a lot of doors.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I ask because I felt the same way when I was first starting out. It took me 6 years until I became a senior developer and the decision maker. I worked hard to gain that position and quickly realized that the junior developers under me, felt the same way I did. LOL</p>
<p>I think most programmers feel like creators and don't want to just follow someone elses plan, they want to design the plan. However, it takes time and hard work to earn the trust to be the man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dude, I HATE working for other people. Even being a senior developer now, it's not like you can do whatever you want. You now answer to NON PROGRAMMERS. An even worse fate, I can assure you. However, you need to make it known that you are looking for a path forward career wise. If one will never be available, maybe it's time to move on. Apply for a senior developer position somewhere else. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a database programmer for most of my programming career.  Within the confines of the development tools it was a fantastically creative and rewarding activity.  Sitting with the client to determine what they need (which is usually different to what they ask for) and then coming up with a solution that not only doesn't break existing data relationships but also is expandable so that when they revisit the project down the road (and they always do) you can change the functionality to what they now perceive the needs to be.</p>
<p>I didn't always do it right but we had enough successes that I can look back with pride and a sense of real accomplishment.</p>
<p>Of course the down side to writing DB queries, updates, and reporting is that it can be mind numbingly repeatative and boring.  Oh boy, another AR report but this time with butterflies in the margins <em>Please Gawd Kill Me Now</em>.  So yeah, if you're on the receiving end of the development team then it can be one of the lower circles of hell.</p>
<p>I regularly worked with web guys and I always thought the designers were able to be creative, but the HTML side seemed like a grind especially dealing with the difference between browsers.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Consultants are in no way &quot;credible&quot;. Their only credibility comes that they cost more and therefor must be better than you own low paid developers from managers point of view. </p>
<p>The main rules with managers:</p>
<ul>
<li>He talks hibrisch I don't understand: <em>Therefore he must be good.</em></li>
<li>He is 4 times more expensive than my current developers: <em>Therefore he must be good.</em></li>
<li>He is better dressed than my current developers: <em>Therefore he must be good.</em></li>
<li>He changed company every 3 months: <em>Therefore he must be good.</em></li>
<li>His project took 4 times as long with tens of thousand of bugs popping up and 3 of our developers ended up in a burn out. <em>Luckily we had him in our team that saved the day.</em></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Prove you can build a framework or technology stack that is just as useful. This would re-position your value and confidence if you're able to do so... or just take your skill to lower hanging fruit in the web world (i.e. less money).</p>
<p>I'm in charge of large frontend stacks, it's very, very difficult to get quality code to publish for large clients who depend on virtually perfect launches. That said, there's a bunch of web frameworks I hate, but the ones I choose to use have allowed our Company to host enterprise applications in a stable fashion, for many years.</p>
<p>The technology changes fast, so you have all the time &amp; opportunity to propose alternatives to your barriers, or learn to master that setup and become a priceless contractor.</p>
<p>edit: And yes I've been in the pits, I've worked on half-a-dozen stacks and most  are not ideal. I make my contributions shine and furthered my career by breaking patterns I hated. I would never get hired for a big company, I work in small software.</p></div>

<p>Definitely this! When you can build frameworks from scratch that are reusable and are actually functional, then you have proven yourself.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Creativity at work is a bit of an oxymoron for the average joe.</p>
<p>Your manager probably doesn't have the time, resources or patience to nourish a bunch of budding artisans. </p>
<p>He cares about goals deadlines and numbers. If you want to have your ideas accepted you have to fight for them.</p>
<p>Find an incremental change that you can <strong>prove</strong> is a better way. By prove I mean ROI numbers and quantifiable goals that align with business needs. (You have to make them want your idea and the best way to do that is to find ways to get them to think it's their idea.) Establish a track record of good ideas, <strong>then</strong> people will listen. </p>
<p>Not before. </p>
<p>You can die on the cross of idealism or succeed in the real world the choice is always yours.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p></div>
