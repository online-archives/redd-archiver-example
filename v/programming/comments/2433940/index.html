<p>I'll be hosting a three part Cybersecurity Q&amp;A in this sub (<a href="https://voat.co/v/programming">/v/programming</a>) starting this Saturday, Marth 10th at 7 PM Eastern and lasting three hours. The sessions will be each Saturday, same time and length, for three weeks.</p>
<p>About me: I am a Cybersecurity researcher with formal training in EC-Council C|EH, C|HFI, Network Defense, and other related topics. I have a background in programming, networking (layer 2 and 3), database management, project management, covering military and private sectors over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>I am not doing this to promote myself for job recruitment opportunities. The sessions are provided as a means to transfer knowledge, exchange ideas, and enhance personal and professional growth in the Cybersecurity field for all involved.</p>
<p>Intended Audience These sessions are meant for individuals in upper management or senior positions, but all are welcome. No topic or questions are considered off-limits, but please try to keep the conversation to subject matter that pertains to the widest audience for the benefit of all involved.</p>
<p>I'll do my best to answer every question, but time and upvoats dictate the flow.</p>
<p>Please Note I won't divulge information or participate in activity which is considered illegal (in the United States); I operate in a strictly non-Black Hat manner. That being said, there is plenty of room for quality intellectual conversation and discussion on the topics at hand.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to gain an understanding of the principles they teach.  Read the language specification for a language you like.  I wouldn't bother too much with memorizing function names or anything like that because APIs change over time.  The idea is that you should be able to know what you need to do and can go into an API documentation, find what you need, and then implement it.</p>
<p>As far as choices and creatively solving a problem, I have good news for you: That is a large part of developing software.  You start with a goal, determine the best language(s), and using your head (and your trusty API reference) you will make the computer do whatever it is your goal needs.</p>
<p>Here's a couple of things they don't really touch on in school that are very important anywhere: Learn a source control system (I prefer Git), learn how to build and run Unit Tests, figure out the difference between monolithic applications and microservices and in which situations each would be appropriate.  Learn how to optimize your code, learn how to build secure code and robust error handling.</p>

<p>They go over all of these things while we learn to program, though to what degree their teachings reflect reality I can only guess at. Right now we are going through how to use Scrum/Agile with git while doing projects for local businesses. Scrum/Agile is surprisingly easy with a background in the military. </p>
<p>There isn't much on monolithic vs micro-services but they <em>do</em> go over some of the laws involving large corporations vs goin' at it on your own/with a partner. Secure code is gone over but to really get into it they make you pony up for extra classes (that I can't afford). I went with the mathematics instead of cyber-sec route anyways.</p>
<p>There are several early classes that have us specifically go over the documentation. Forcing us to learn from it and then make our projects from that. While the documentation is good enough for professionals to use as reference, it makes for some <em>terrible</em> teaching/learning material. </p>

<p>This is probably why I have such problems in a traditional learning environment. I try to learn the underlying ideas behind what they are teaching instead of just memorizing shit for a week and forgetting it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you are getting a good foundation, that's good.  For secure programming, that is truly a &quot;matryoshka doll&quot; type of thing to get into and even after multiple classes it's only a foundation and it's something that can keep you on your toes well into your professional career.  Secure programming has layers upon layers of complexity and one can never really account for all possibilities while implementing code securely in a practical manner.  It is possible but not practical to get extremely granular control over things, but project managers have deadlines and projects have costs; the more effort that goes into this aspect increases the time to complete the project which results in increased cost.  So that, essentially, is how we wind up witnessing mind boggling news stories of unbelievable breaches and data loss.  Because in the end, some aspects of security were given less attention or none and the company decides to weigh the risk versus a possible hit to their credibility, pay a hefty fine, and the related costs in cleaning up the mess.  Secure coding is just becoming more important as these scenes continue to happen; I only see the emphasis on secure coding growing further as time goes on.</p></div>

Post on a couple of other subs like <a href="https://voat.co/v/TellVoat">v/TellVoat</a> or <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever">v/whatever</a> to get a bigger turnout and hopefully encourage more specialists to do these types of stuff.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Cybersecurity Q&amp;A, 24 Hour Lead-Up Primer: </p>
<p>In order for this to be of use to the widest possible audience, it is recommended that questions be posed in a manner which would present the greatest knowledge gain for the widest audience possible while keeping in mind that the format is targeted to senior level practitioners.  <em>No questions will be considered off limits while they are within the realm of programming and cybersecurity</em> so please consider the fact that the audience is GLOBAL and <strong>situations and circumstances may vary by region and nation</strong>.</p>
<p>Well formed questions will pose an actual and actionable problem, theoretical problems and edge-cases are not necessarily going to benefit everyone but if you strongly believe that the discussion in this regard will benefit those involved for some upcoming problem please don't hesitate to add it to the discussion.  As always, time and upvoats will dictate the flow, but if a underserved topic or question remains and begs for further discussion please feel free to message me to engage on it.</p>
<p>It is suggested that all day one questions be posed BEFORE the start time so that the maximum amount of answers and interaction may take place.</p>
<p>Please be civil, this is meant to be an intellectual exchange of information and not an ePeen measurement contest.</p></div>
