      <div class="md"><p>As soon as I have seen how Reddit works, it become obvious to me that the downvoting algorithm is a logic fallacy for a forum. Since those who made Reddit must be pretty intelligent people, and also those who made Voat can't be less intelligent, my question is pretty simple: is it possible that both teams of skilled programmers didn't notice this logic fallacy? Or by putting the question in inquisitor mode: do you think it is possible that both Reddit and Voat owners are using deliberately the downvoting algorithm for eventual manipulation, since it's pretty difficult for intelligent people not noticing this obvious logic fallacy?</p>
<p>TL / DR - Can a programmer be any good without being proficient in logic? If the algorithm is working technically, but the purpose of it is illogical for users, can a skilled programmer not notice the logic fallacy?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree that down-voting systems are inherently terrible, your post was incomprehensible, you changed subject on a dime, you made massive leaps without any connectives, and you seem to have implied a dormant conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>It's difficult to provide any meaningful commentary or response since your entire post made no fucking sense. But I'll see if I can try, because I'm bored and I like a challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it become obvious to me that the downvoting algorithm is a logic fallacy for a forum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You should elaborate on how it's a &quot;logic&quot; fallacy. I don't see any <strong><em>logical</em></strong> fallacy, at all. The logic holds up perfectly. If you disagree with a post (the first predicate) THEN you may down-vote it (a secondary predicate, forming an inferential relation). In fact, the contra-positive is also true: If you don't down-vote a post, then you may like it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since those who made Reddit must be pretty intelligent people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You've made a really large assumption here and provided no evidence to back it up. Those who made Reddit were businessmen trying to find a way to maximize advertising dollars. Those who made Voat just copied Reddit's form factor without applying their own design intuition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>also those who made Voat can't be less intelligent</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why can't they?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is it possible that both teams of skilled programmers didn't notice this logic fallacy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without pointing out where the logical fallacy lies (which you seem to imply is &quot;obvious&quot;, but it's not so) it's impossible to answer this question. However it <strong><em>is</em></strong> possible to point out that since Voat merely copied Reddit and was not developed independently, it's not necessary for two individual teams to fail to notice a fallacy. Only the first team needs to fail, and the second team inherits their failures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or by putting the question in inquisitor mode</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the FUCK is &quot;inquisitor mode&quot;? Is that your way of saying &quot;conspiracy theory mode&quot;?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>do you think it is possible that both Reddit and Voat owners are using deliberately the downvoting algorithm for eventual manipulation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Manipulation of WHAT? I don't believe that the down-vote system poses a threat of manipulating anything. All it does is give users the ability to ruin their own experience by creating echo chambers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TL / DR - Can a programmer be any good without being proficient in logic?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is <strong><em>entirely</em></strong> unrelated to the two other entirely unrelated points you've already made. First you started talking about an &quot;obvious&quot; logical fallacy, but never explained what the fallacy was. Then you suggested Reddit and Voat are using down-votes as part of some conspiracy to manipulate the masses but failed to explain how. Now you're asking a general question about programming and formal logic. A leap like this would frighten Evel Knievel.</p>
<p>That said, I would say it's a bit more complicated that than. On the one hand, logic and programming go hand-in-hand. Boolean algebra derives from formal logic and drives all conditional statements. Without the ability to follow steps sequentially to their logical conclusion you can't understand the execution of a process and therefore can't hope to debug it. On the other hand, &quot;logic&quot; is often used to refer to a specific branch of formal logic involving proofs. Just as you don't need to be good at geometry to do algebra, and you don't need to be good at discrete math to do calculus, you also don't need to be good at this particular subset of logic in order to program. It's a very diverse field.</p></div>

According to logic, it's a logic fallacy, because according to cause - effect chain, the downvote is useless, or even harmful. You can use downvote only for fun.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you've severely misunderstood the definition of &quot;logical fallacy&quot;. If something makes sense mathematically, it's not logically fallacious</p>
<p>Now it could be socially harmful. It could be detrimental to a community. It could be negative in general. That doesn't mean it's a fallacy, it just means it's a bad idea. Giving 3 year old children access to soldering irons is also a bad idea -- but that doesn't mean it's a &quot;logical fallacy&quot;. It's just plain dumb.</p>
<p>You also said that the down vote is &quot;physically&quot; harmful. I don't know about you, but I've <strong><em>never</em></strong> heard of a <strong><em>single</em></strong> instance of a person getting bruised, bleeding, breaking bones, or even getting scratched as the result of a down vote. There's no physical harm involved. There's the potential for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychological harm if the person is weak-minded and overly-concerned with how others perceive them (&quot;Oh my god, someone hates me! I should just die!&quot;)</li>
<li>Social harm if a person finds themselves unable to participate in a community (&quot;I asked someone why they hate women, got a down vote, now I have -1 CCP and I'm not allowed to talk to anyone for 24 hours -- the isolation is killing me&quot;)</li>
<li>Informational harm if people start down voting based on their own biased beliefs (&quot;Someone posted irrefutable proof that the earth is round, but I think it's flat, so I'm going to down vote them so no one else sees this proof and I can pretend it didn't happen&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>But physical harm? Nah. Can't happen.</p>
<p>That's not to say that down voting is a <strong><em>good</em></strong> thing. As I said before, it creates echo chambers. You develop subverse-culture where a small group of people have a shared set of beliefs and anything that adheres to their beliefs is up voted and anything that runs counter to their beliefs in down voted. Eventually they're swimming in a pool of posts that validate their beliefs and they've closed off all external opinions. But just because down votes are a bad idea, they lead to the division of society, they reduce our ability to empathize with others, and they aide in dehumanizing our opponents -- there's still no <strong><em>logical</em></strong> fallacy.</p>
<p>As there's no logical fallacy, the fallacy hasn't become obvious.</p></div>
