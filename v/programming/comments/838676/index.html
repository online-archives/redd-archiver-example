<p>A lot of the html elements are hard coded strings it looks like. Are we sure those are all unchanged?</p>

<p>I was thinking it could be something that had changed in Voat. Mainly because it still half works (as in it runs), and nothing has changed on my end since I last used it.  I don't know if they have changed though. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>so banned strings are likely case sensitive</p>

<p>String instructions say: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mikex5/VoatAutoMod/blob/master/VoatAutoMod_Release/src/AutoMod.java#L45">// also, words should be lowercase since strings are converted to lowercase</a></p>

<p>Possible issue? </p></div>
