    <div class="md"><p>Early on in my programming career I used to code around the user by trying to think of every scenario they could throw at my software and make sure I never let them mess up. It was a time consuming process but the users were happy because they could get around just fine and most any error possible was handled. Now that I am long in the tooth I write programs that steer my users so they can't get into trouble in the first place. The software flows much better and I don't have to think about what kind of trouble they can get into because I make sure they can only do what is proper. This has made me a very efficient project completer and my users don't complain about my software getting in their way. Instead they ask for more features since I made their job easier and they get more out of the software so they integrate it into their work more. It's a far cry from the mess these young and still wet behind the ears programmers produce with their buggy and convoluted frameworks and tool chains. I keep it simple, keep it real and school those young dipshits left and right because they get caught in implementation rather than making a good system. Mature programmers who took their licks and learned make great mentors but these kids think they know everything because they are up on all the latest fads in coding. They don't realize the art and science of writing software hasn't changed one bit at the fundamental level and frameworks only serve to &quot;dumb-it-down&quot; so their meager skills can keep up with programmers who actually know what's up. I love it when they finally get that &quot;a-ha&quot; moment and understand that you don't need a full framework to do something when five lines of simple code gives you the equivalent result with no overhead. If only more programmers could learn from the old grey beards and understand that we aren't getting better by building on more layers of crap. The old ways are still very much relevant and they will continue to be. Users are not the enemy. Frameworks and trendy fads are the enemy.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Just the a few days ago one of my coworkers asked me to consider refactoring the following JavaScript code:</p>
<pre><code>const pad = n =&gt; n &lt; 10 ? `0${n}` : n;
const formatDate = date =&gt; `${date.getUTCFullYear()}-${pad(date.getUTCMonth() + 1)}-${pad(date.getUTCDate())} ${pad(date.getUTCHours())}:${pad(date.getUTCMinutes())}:${pad(date.getUTCSeconds())}`
</code></pre>
<p>It takes a date and formats it into UTC <code>YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss</code> using two single-line functions. Simple, right?</p>
<p>His rationale was (paraphrased):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This doesn't look like it would be easy to maintain moving forwards. You should consider using <code>Moment.js</code> to format this instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My first reaction was &quot;How is this not easy to maintain?&quot;, followed shortly by &quot;Why add all of Moment.js for one date formatting operation?&quot; and finally &quot;No, this is a stupid suggestion.&quot;</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I see no problem with the two lines of code here. They are efficient and get the job done. Aside from long line length there is nothing problematic about it. Moment.js would be a waste for such a small task and it sounds like it's not even up to the task anyway. He's an idiot.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You replaced <code>date.getUTCSeconds()</code> at the end of the line with <code>date.getUTCMilliSeconds()</code>, which is not only the desired function, but is the wrong name, the real function being <code>date.getUTCMilliseconds()</code>.</p>
<p>That wasn't difficult to spot. All I had to do was scroll along the line, which is the one unfortunate part about template strings in JavaScript - they can't be broken up into multiple lines without inserting multiple lines into the output. That said, unit tests would have failed long before it ever got to production.</p></div>

You create a wall of text with words that basically look the same '${pad(date.getUTC'</p>
<p>I mean it is hiding the true code which is &quot;YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS&quot;</p>
<p>I am not that experienced in javascript, so this is out of my head.</p>

<p>I look at it and I can instantly recognize the code. Your eyes gets drawn what is the real functional code and you ignore the noise that is not important.</p>
<p>Even without reading the code you can, based on the white space and the ordering of the words, sense that something is wrong in this code or not. This is important because just by scrolling at a relative fast pace I can now detect things that may give clues that it does not compute.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason I was curious is because I do not fully agree with you regarding there not having been considerable changes at the fundamental level. I would definitely agree that there is a lot of churn regarding new frameworks, especially in front-end development, but there are some areas where things have changed very much, and where these changes makes large differences. Especially in regards to concurrency. Of course, the best option regarding concurrency is to avoid it as much as is viable, but for those applications where the difficulty includes for instance scaling in regards to massive amounts of concurrent activity, the newer developments very  much can help or be necessary. I don't think Twitter, for instance, would have been nearly as robust and resilient regarding scaling of concurrent activity if they did not approach the challenges with fundamentally different/newer concurrency (and arguably distributed) programming models. They used to have lots of &quot;fail whales&quot; back when they still used Ruby on Rails, but that is a very rare sight these days.</p>
<p>Of course, what is very important to remember, and which I think you have a major point regarding and which I touched lightly on previously, is that these techniques are far from always needed and can be much worse than simpler alternatives due to their costs, and so they should generally not be used unless their many costs justify their usage (though their costs can very a lot from team to team, project to project, organization to organization, etc.). And thinking through things can help very much - if for instance building a very large &quot;monolith&quot; for a given project will be very risky, time-consuming, difficult to maintain and might need a lot of (lucky and successful) design, requirements work, etc., it will typically be much, much better when possible to instead create a lot of smaller, independent applications, especially if these applications do not need to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>But my argument is overall that, for some applications and challenges, things have changed.</p>
<p>I also think that (meta-language/ML-style) functional programming offers a lot of improvements for many/most cases and areas for basic development, and I think that is a major part of why such functionality has seeped into all mainstream programming languages, including Java and C++. But I do think that a focus on choosing the most suited fundamental approach and avoiding &quot;complex&quot;/&quot;advanced&quot; solutions and approaches when such are not justified gives much more value, and that another part of the main value of functional programming is that it supports such &quot;complex&quot;/&quot;advanced&quot; solutions and approaches when such really are justified or even needed.</p>
<p>Concurrency in particular can be very, very difficult to do correctly depending on the task or project. And while the first approach to concurrency should always be &quot;how can we avoid concurrency or avoid having to deal with it&quot;, it is for some projects and tasks necessary to deal with.</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p>I always hear this &quot;monolith&quot; is bad, however all your independent modules will in the end grow into a giant monolith as they grow and tend to more and more interact with each other.</p>
<p>Monolith design can be as flexible as your independent applications but way way way faster and stable. It all depends on the quality developer that acted as a guide how to do it. This knowledge has been lost since SCRUM teams have become the norm. I have seen how very skilled developer have reverted into a losers mentality where failing a sprint has become a norm. Following the processes is now more important than creating good programs.</p>
<p>Monolithic programs are too slow to adapt? Have you not noticed that users are fed up with programs that change daily in functionality yet again? Changes are so fast that no one cares anymore. All they notice are icon changes, font changes, more animation but have no clue what changed in functionality. The users brain has adapted to these changes by ignoring what changed. No one cares anymore what is new.</p></div>

<p>See, there's your mistake. You see incompetence all around you and think that being above the average level of incompetence somehow makes you a god among men. 90% of every industry is incompetent fucks and rank amateurs, at least. Don't become too into yourself just because you're not. John Carmack didn't make yet another, slightly better than average 2D side-scroller and call it a day.</p></div>

<p>A loaded question. That's a great start.</p>
<p>Are you really interested in &quot;improving&quot; and &quot;educating&quot;? Or just congratulating yourself whilst flinging dirt at easy targets...?</p>

<p>For starters, the <code>printf</code> in the banner image at the top of the page should be <code>puts</code>. This is such a common mistake that GCC and Clang will both convert it automatically, but that's no excuse for making it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Bloat is a big problem and there are way too many frameworks and tools at everyone's disposal many of which are horrible. But that isn't the biggest problem facing the tech community. It's the people.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ what does it take to find a developer who doesn't suck shit at their job. Just because a tool is available doesn't mean it needs to get hammered into the project. Learn how to write something that can be read. Managers exacerbate the issue in many ways, chiefly by not seeming to understand the different between a good developer and a bad one. Diversity hires and social justice are out of control, SCRUM practices are bringing capable developers to their knees.</p>
<p>Often in the end they just get Indians to do it.</p>
<p>One good developer can do a better job in less time than 20 bad ones!</p></div>
