    <div class="md"><p>Totally subjective, but I despise all things Angular. It's the most opinionated framework out there. You have to do every single thing the &quot;angular way.&quot; Expect a lot of mental load and way too much abstraction of things that are actually simple. Angular over-engineers everything.</p>
<p>I much prefer the style made popular by React.js. I personally use riot.js. Vue.js is also good. Mix and match with libraries as needed.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I could vouch for Angular 1 but 2? It has become something very different, a lot bigger in scope. The first version was a cool hack to change the paradigm when writing webpages. The new one is a full blown framework and it's hard to see a direct evolution path between the two, which makes me confused and suspicious</p>
<p>I'm not saying that I don't like it. Really, I haven't learned as much of it than of the original so the best I can say is I don't know but if it became a framework instead of a library I'll make sure to learn about other more established, mature options out there instead first. Also the fact that it largely depends on Typescript, which probably won't ever be supported natively by browsers puts me off. It really changed a lot from the Angular I knew and loved, to the point I just don't know it anymore</p>
<p>Finally, to be a full-stack developer you don't have to learn Angular necessarily. There are tons of other options out there for front-end. some of which have been mentioned here already.</p></div>
