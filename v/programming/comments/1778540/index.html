<p>Ultimately, I ended up with a FilCo Ninja. I looked at Das Keyboard, Corsair, Cherry, Azio, CoolerMaster, and a couple of others I can't remember now. I liked Das Keyboard, but you had to go with either blank keys or top printed keys. The Ninja offered side printed keys to give the cool looking black finish and the ability to actually find obscure keys when you need it.</p>
<p>For me, the Cherry MX Black keys gave me the most comfortable typing experience. The blues and reds just didn't work for me. The FilCo is solid, has a nice stable feel and is about as plain as it gets. I've gotten used to the mechanical sound while typing, you kind of forget about it. The wife doesn't seem to mind it either. That was my biggest concern.</p>
<p>If you are considering a quality mechanical keyboard, I'd say Das Keyboard or FilCo are about evenly matched. it really depends on your instinct at that point.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of. I mostly use a very thin laptop. The keyboard is the worst typing experience you can imagine. The keys have a very shallow throw and I tend to mis-type constantly. I finally decided to get a real keyboard. At that point, I had opened Pandora's box. There are tons of keyboards, and they all are better than my laptop's poor keyboard. The question then becomes, do I buy a $15 keyboard or a $100+ keyboard? A friend showed me his Das Keyboard. I was hooked. I really loved the feel of the mechanical keys.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It's one of those things you don't need but is nice to have. I use the little keyboard on my laptop all the time but rather use the mech when I'm at home. I've never met anyone that regrets buying one. People get into it and go all out with keycaps (if you do get one and the keys ware out I'd say get double shot pcb) and lights. Buy a switch sampler and try them out. Yeah your going to be spending a good bit but it'll be the last keyboard you need. </p></div>
