<p>The problem is that we just can't trust the next image host that pops up to be the one that'll actually last this time. We've been burned too many times for that. That means that <strong>no matter what else we do, some of us have to write scraping bots to make backups of all images linked on Voat</strong>. But how to redirect the users from the old image URLs to the new ones? I think there are 3 potential solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a change to Voat itself to where it automatically redirects an image host that's down to a fallback host (or shares the load between multiple fallback hosts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a special redirect plugin for the most popular browsers that will automatically redirect an image host that's been designated down to a fallback host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Most insane solution] Create a peer to peer network that Voat users will be running that will keep some fraction of all image files on each user's computer, then have a browser extension automatically load the image corresponding to the URL from this p2p network if it's not accessible from the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm happy to start coding, but I want to hear from other people first. Do you think one of these ideas is best? Do you have your own? What do you think people would be most likely to actually use?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you're a regex wizard, that may be doable. Perhaps consider using <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/">Python</a> instead? It'd probably involve less hair-pulling and be more maintainable by others.</p>
<p>In either case, please try it. Scraping the popular image hosts like <a href="https://imgoat.com/gallery">Imgoat gallery</a> individually would be one approach, or you can try to scrape Voat directly and back up every image that has at least one upgoat.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think #1 is pretty smart. If you have Voat (or just a comment bot) automatically detect an image link and automatically upload the image to a list of alternate image hosts, there's copies on other hosts if one goes down.
EDIT: with bots, it's not so long term because comments eventuall become outdate if all the hosts at the time the comment was made are down. Otherwise the bot has to update old comments. An offcial voat feature could be much more robust about staying updated.</p></div>
