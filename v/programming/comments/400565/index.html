    <div class="md"><p>Using github.com as a host is like going to a restaurant that has a sign posted saying &quot;We reserve the right to spit in your food.&quot;  They probably won't, but if they do, too bad. You were warned.</p>
<p>Given that anyone can run git or CVS, or any number of other, in my view, simpler and superior code management systems on their own servers and mitigate the possibility of some stranger deleting your project because it contains something that someone else finds &quot;offensive&quot;, only the foolish or the lazy or the unconcerned use it as their actual primary repository.  It also sucks as an end user software download site, and I wish people would stop trying to use it as such.</p></div>

<p>I have written countless times on that topic. Funnily enough, I didn't write any solution (I just said what is not one), and you already rejected that nothing. Third, I'm the moderator of this subverse, which is called <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a>. It's about programming. It shall not be a self assuring echo chamber of hatred about whatever remotely programming related, no matter if that 'hate' is justified or not. This subverse is still about programming.</p>
<p>I guess that some topics in here would also be allowed in <a href="/v/til">/v/TIL</a> and upvoted. Does it belong there? Probably not.</p>
<p>Really, those who're interested in that, by all means, create a subverse for it, and if it fulfills some standards, I'll link to it in the sidebar.</p></div>

<p>Because users upvote offtopic and worthless crap constantly. It's the reason why there are separate subreddits for <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/gaming">/r/gaming</a> vs <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/games">/r/games</a>. As subverses get popular they tend to turn into junk as low effort, low value stuff is voted up more often than other more valuable, but higher effort topics.</p>
<p>Stuff like this just doesn't belong on a programming subverse just because it's tangentially related to the topic. Just like I don't want to see screenshots of people's cakes that have some &quot;funny code&quot; in the icing.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I get tired of this shit too.</p>
<p>Can I recommend putting a better definition of &quot;Programming Related&quot; in the rules? Perhaps &quot;Submission must have code or theory&quot; A better definition would exclude stuff like this from being valid.</p>
<p>Also, provide a link in the rule section to a more appropriate subverse for submissions like this.</p></div>

<p>What's a good name for it though? I'd say <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> versus <a href="/v/code">/v/code</a> is a good distinction but both of the subs already exist and have goals already. <a href="/v/programmingpolitics">/v/programmingpolitics</a> is too long though.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I like <a href="/v/programmingpolitics">/v/programmingpolitics</a> - It tells you right away what to kind of content to expect. But maybe, we need to think broader, and have a general <a href="/v/internetpolitics">/v/internetpolitics</a> or something like that. Seeing how <a href="/v/kotakuinaction">/v/KotakuInAction</a> thrives in terms of submissions with actually quite a specific scope, a broader subverse could survive if &quot;done correctly&quot; (?)</p></div>

<p>Google isn't difficult; and the word is a neologism so yes, it's not simple to understand like &quot;cheese&quot;, for example.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to refrain from calling people bad names. It diminishes your credibility.</p>
