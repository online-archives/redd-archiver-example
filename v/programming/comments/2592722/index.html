<p>Yes you know who you are: Those that logs useless stack traces when they get this exception.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of your log file to show you how your code functions. You code should make that clear in the code and not through logging. If the only way to understand your code us using a log file then your design is wrong.</p>
<p>The purpose of log files is to guide the none-developer IT service team and testers to what the program is doing so they don't need to contact you to fix the issue. Even when you have long gone and the company lost the source code, the log files should be easy enough to read so an analyst can reconstruct the program.</p>
<p>It is harder than you think it is. You probably need to redesign your code in such a way that methods returns useful information that can be used for logging and normal functionality.</p>
<p>In addition tell the logging what you are going to do next. </p>
<p>Rough example to get the idea.</p>
<pre><code>10:30:40  - Retrieving list of customers for company 'WYZ'
10.30:41  - 100 customers retrieved.
10:30:42  - Verifying the list if we have corrupt date
10:30;42  - 2 instances of corrupt data found and removed
10:30:42 - emailing  98 customers for company 'WYZ'
10:30:45 - 97 customers successfully emailed, 2 failed.
10;30:45 -     - Customer 'abbbcc@hotmal.com' failed to deliver
10;30:45 -     - Customer 'abbbcc122@Live.com' failed to deliver
10:30:45 - Updating database for 97 customers that succeeded and 2 failed.

<p>The interesting thing is when you develop your code in such a way that it makes logs very readable, it actually helps you developing better products and way easier to test. On top of that your development will speed up making you even a better developer.</p></div>

<p>This is quite contradictory advice. If log files are meant to help non-developers offer program support, logs should not be so verbose that people use it to reconstruct the whole program. </p>
<p>For people on the support desk, logs should be as focused as possible to help aid a quick response. They have no need for thousands of lines, each describing what action a program took.</p>
<p>And for reverse-engineering a program, wouldn't it make more sense to interact with the actual program itself? That would be an easier and quicker way than reading the log files for all kinds of situations.</p></div>
