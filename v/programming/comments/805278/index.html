<p>Because at compile time they could add in the backdoor and never include it in the source but devs work in with the source will notice extra pics after its compiled, or not? The dlls can be encrypted for all of the information so no one will ever know even if you were comparing final builds with the official one. You'd see a difference but you wouldn't know what it is.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The Brave browser is luckily or unluckily using npm for everything in it.  They aren't just copy pasting some crypto code that could be altered with no one likely seeing it.  I would say that it's not easy.  Often it involves subtle errors in the random number generator that compresses the number of private keys it can produce.  You take that with some data produced as output to the encryption and you can find the key.  It involves some level of semi-brute force and very complicated math so the likelihood any of us would be able to use it is pretty small.  You would have to have a lot to gain like if you were part of a criminal outfit or if you were the NSA.</p>
<p>I'm really exited about brave.  I got some errors trying to run it so I haven't seen it yet.  Did you get a successful build?</p></div>
