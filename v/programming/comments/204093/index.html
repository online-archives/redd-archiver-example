</p>
<p>I've only found one other company that does about 30% of what my idea is and they only concentrate on one part of my two piece system. It has to do with Linux authentication and VPN software. Unfortunately I don't do any programming and by the time i could learn it, it would probably be too late.</p>
<p>Problem is that while I can provide all the server resources, software, bandwidth, setup and administration... I can't afford to pay anyone. So I'd have to find someone or multiple that would be truly be interested in starting a company and have equal ownership in lieu of a paycheck.</p>
<p>So back to my original question, where would be the best place to start looking for someone? Apologies if this is the wrong subsection of the site, I couldn't think of a better place to ask.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Have a look on<a href="https://careers.stackoverflow.com/"> stack overflow careers</a>, it's a little bit expensive to list a kob  I'll be worth the money hopefully.</p>
<p>Other than that, have a look on some popular forums and IRC chats on freenode for example, you can usually find people there who are willing do so some work #Drupal and #Android may be good popular places to start, even if they're not the platforms you're looking to develop on.</p>
<p>Best of luck :)</p></div>
