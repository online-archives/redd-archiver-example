    <div class="md"><p>We use a self-hosted gitlab server now. I'm very happy with gitlab but I've been using gitlab since the beginning of time. </p>
<p>It just depends on what you are doing, you can use a self hosted gitlab if you are serious or gitlab.com for a free (I think) service.</p>
<p>Nothing really wrong with github in my opinion (other than their retard pull vs merge nomenclature) and its benefit is it's used by so many that you're bound to get more contributions and activity in that ecosystem.</p>
<p>Moving repos is easy, so can't really go wrong. Don't like github, go to gitlab in 10 minutes. It's literally copy and paste easy. </p>
<p>Send me a PM when you decide so I can check it out (unless it's a Voat clone, then it's war. Not really but I have an image to maintain ;) ).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a website, why are you looking at VCS sites?  I think both Github and Gitlab offer hosting for pages associated with a project but they are supposed to be for docs and whatnot.</p>
<p>You're right that Github was bought by Microsoft.  Even before then it was proprietary software which you could not run yourself.  It has also removed &quot;problematic&quot; projects in the past.  The C+= parody project, some  gamergate info pages (Gitlab did this too), and another because it used a &quot;bad&quot; word like retard or boobs or something.</p>
<p>Gitlab is open source, at least the main part of it is.  They offer a paid version with more &quot;business&quot;  features.  All the options can be hosted in-house if you want but Gitlab also offer paid hosting for it.  I assume you want want free which they do offer on gitlab.com.  Allegedly it is simple to install and manage if you use their sanctioned methods and operating systems.  If you install from source or a package that was built from source then you are in for a world of pain.  It is several services to manage with tens of thousands of dependencies, none of which come from your package manager but the language specific ones.  FUCKING WEB DEVS AND THEIR INSANE SHIT!</p>
<p>There is a very friendly instance of gitlab software at <a href="https://gitgud.io">https://gitgud.io</a> which was started in the wake of gamergate.  I see they lost their Vivian James branding at some point which isn't a good sign, IMO.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161206142226/https://gitgud.io/users/sign_in">Old branding on Wayback Machine</a>  But they do still say this on the signin page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitGud.io was created October 2014 in response to other popular git hosting services active participation in user politics. We wanted an apolitical platform that focused on the best features and technology for our users. Since then we've become home to over 6,000 projects and 9,900 users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I run gitolite on my NAS to provide some easy local sharing between a few systems.</p>
<p>There are more options but again I ask: why are you looking for git or source code services?  Shouldn't you be looking for common web hosting?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've written a web application in Django(python) and one of the steps in a tutorial to learn how to create this stuff, the tutor instructed to upload the code to a git* site, port it over to compile(?) in Heroku and attach Amazon Web Services to host the static files.</p>
<p>So I've written a new application which, my understanding is, to upload to a Git* project site and then host it on something like Heroku again. Though I'm not experienced here so I'm open to advice!</p></div>

If you're looking to host your own, you can run a gitlab instance ( for a large group ) or a gitea server ( which I run solely for me on a pi3 )</p></div>
