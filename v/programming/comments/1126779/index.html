      <div class="md"><p>I've been toying around with [MFM](http://www.movablefeastmachine.org/) the last few days, because I find the concept really fascinating.</p>
<p>I normally do game programming in Unity3D, and figured I'd try to write a MFM that could hook into Unity.</p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but there is a downside to using Unity for this. Unity works off of components and gameobjects. To access an instance of a component, you must create a gameobject that has the instance attached to it - also, these can only run on the main thread.</p>
<p>This of course is a problem for large datasets, and I would never use gameobjects/components for that anyway. But I need a hook. </p>
<p>Unity is awesome for a lot of things - one of them being that you can create 'prefabs' that look/act in certain ways when you spawn them. I want to use this prefab feature to create templates of my Atoms in the MFM. </p>
<p>But since the components cannot live in any other thread than the main thread, I have to load the instructions from the prefabs when the application loads.</p>
<p>Instructions are then loaded into the atom when it is created. An instruction can be as simple as "Move one tile in a random direction", and Atoms can have multiple instructions. The instructions are simply a class that inherits DCInstructions which has a Command action.</p>
<p>~~~
public class DCInstruction : MonoBehaviour
{
    public List<DCInstructionMemory> Properties;
    public DCEventHandler Command;</p>
<p>    public virtual void Load()
    {
    }
}
~~~
*You'll notice there is a "Properties" field too, but we'll get back to that.*</p>
<p>A full instruction might look something like this:
~~~
public class DCMover : DCInstruction
{
    public override void Load()
    {
        base.Load();</p>
<p>        Command = (s, a) =>
        {
            DCCoord targetCoord = DCHelper.GetRandomDirection(a.Node.Coord);</p>
<p>            if (DCCore.GetNode(targetCoord) == null)
            {
                DCCore.MoveNode(a.Node, targetCoord);
            }
        };
    }
}
~~~</p>
<p>This is all well and good. It works, and things do what they need to. But here's the thing.</p>
<p>If I were to use components only, I could simply access a property in an instruction by doing:
~~~
gameObject.GetComponent<DCInstruction>().myFloatProperty = 1.0f;
~~~
But as mentioned, that requires that the object actually exists in the Unity gameworld.</p>
<p>When doing it the way I'm doing, I can't access any properties on the component, because the actual component is not unique - so if I change the component property value on one Atom, it'll reflect onto all the others that are using the same instruction component.</p>
<p>I've tried using a Dictionary<K,V> to create a form of internal propertylist for the Atoms, but it is incredibly slow when you get a couple thousand atoms going. It's obviously not the right way to do it, as you could end up overriding some property that another instruction uses.</p>
<p>An instruction that uses Properties:
~~~
public class DCImp : DCInstruction
{
    public float consumeChance;</p>
<p>    public override void Load()
    {
        base.Load();</p>
<p>        Command = (s, a) =>
        {
            DCNode node = a.Node;
            DCCoord targetCoord = DCHelper.GetRandomDirection(node.Coord);
            DCNode targetNode = DCCore.GetNode(targetCoord);</p>
<p>            float energy = node.GetPropertyValue("energy");</p>
<p>            if (energy <= 0)
            {
                DCCore.RemoveNode(node);
            }
            else if (targetNode == null)
            {
                if (energy >= 1)
                {
                    DCCore.CreateNode(node.Template, targetCoord);
                    node.AddPropertyValue("energy", -0.5f);
                }
                else
                {
                    DCCore.MoveNode(node, targetCoord);
                    node.AddPropertyValue("energy", -0.01f);
                }
            }
            else
            {
                if (targetNode.GetInstruction<DCRes>())
                {
                    DCCore.RemoveNode(targetNode);
                    node.AddPropertyValue("energy", 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
~~~</p>
<p>Currently, Properties is a Dictionary<string,float>, and I'm using TryGetValue when doing a lookup - but it's still slow.</p>
<p>So, how would you go about storing the properties of an instruction in an Atom, that'll give fast read/write access? Can the dictionary be optimized further, to shorten the lookup time (different key than string), and if so, how would you identify that key when needed?</p>
<p>Or do I need some sort of DB structure to better handle all this - or would that be just as slow as individual dictionary lookups?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance :)</p></div>
