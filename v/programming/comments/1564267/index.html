    <div class="md"><p>I think massive AI is a substantial exaggeration. It doesn't even have to be particularly fast because of frame continuity - most of what's there in one frame will be there in the next. It could have a simple probabilistic detection that gets refined each frame.</p>
<p>Cheating this system would certainly be far easier than creating it. Latency is one challenge like you mentioned -<em>we need at most 17ms latency for a 60FPS game</em>- but that might not even be the biggest problem! Think about the bandwidth involved here. Movies are compressed like crazy. A game running at 60FPS 1080p without compression would require 1920*1080<em>4</em>60 bytes of data per second - that's half a gigabyte per second. So the servers obviously need to not only render the data for every single player but then also create some sort of per-user relational compression before sending it out which would involve contrasting two complete frame buffers. And then you need redundancies for when things inevitably and constantly break, without meaningfully interrupting the players' experience in any way. </p>
<p>I don't see any clear way quantum computing could help here either. Quantum computing isn't a &quot;just like regular computers but a million times faster.&quot; The technology behind quantum computers is useful for a very small subset of all problems. For They'll definitely do things like break current forms of encryption since factorization falls into this subset of problems, but quantum computing is not the future of computing that some are making it out to be.</p></div>

<p>You're not taking into account that some objects are moving too (trees, grass, animals...). </p>
<p>Real-time detection and discrimination of objects versus the real players on the map will require a lot of computing, and thus will considerably increase the latency.</p>
<p>Also, video stream codecs are not lossless, and create artefacts in dark areas and moving objects (trees, plants...), where players of FPS usually tend to hide.</p>
<p>The only way to overcome this, is to bribe one of the devs working at the game company your game is from, and get him to code/install cheat modes for your character. ^ ^</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It is, given current technology, <em>relatively</em> trivial to rapidly identify the 'class' of objects within a scene. Image recognition has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of deep reinforcement learning. The current 'turing tests' for image recognition have gotten to the point that competitors are not expected to just identify features/objects of an image but describe implicit relationships - <em>the cat just jumped from the table on the right to the chair on the left.</em></p>
<p>The reason frame continuity is important is because you can prioritize a scene into various regions. So for instance if you know for a high certainty that a certain region of the frame is a wall with no actors - then you an lower that regions processing priority for future scene analyses. And similarly if there's some sort of dynamic object that can't be carefully identified you can prioritize it. And these prioritizations carry over from one scene to another. For instance once you do find a player it will be trivial to 'lock' onto him every frame until he is completely obfuscated. &quot;Increasing latency&quot; makes no sense. From a player's perspective it would be completely seamless.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I was making an text-based game recently and it occurred to me that you could have cheater-free multiplayer by doing everything server-side and just streaming the text to display back to the client. Translating this to a 3D action game, you'd need to render graphics server-size and stream video back to the client. Any amount of latency would likely be unacceptable for a fast-passed competitive game, but maybe not for a slow or casual game.</p></div>
