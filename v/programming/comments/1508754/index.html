<p>I did notice some problems with the community that it shares with C++: the denial of problems and blaming the user. It’s much less severe but in some areas it’s near absolute. Any mention that parenthesis is a problem is the obvious one of course, but I soon hit another one: a macro can only evaluate to a single form. Suggesting this is an annoying limitation elicits many a comment of “you shouldn’t ever need that” and “you’re doing it wrong” without managing to show good alternatives and in many cases just outright ignoring the examples I gave. Or the worst response: “that doesn’t even make sense”, which is the response you get from people who are so deep into the language they can’t escape the box. This is a pity and makes it impossible to introduce fixes for these problems. You can’t fix a problem you can’t even accept exists after all.</p>

<p>Yeah, it sucks to be told straight up that the best way to progress in your learning is <code>sudo /bin/rm -rf</code>.</p></div>

<p>I have seen this in any language. It is extremely rare to encounter a developer that cares about his code and especially designs it in such a way that it makes the users happy. In a lot of cases, designing, the code for the user actually reduces the complexity. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical responses I hear from developers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't reproduce the error, so it does not exists.</li>
<li>You have tested it wrong, first you must click button A and then B not B and then A.</li>
<li>My program crashes because you did not install service pack 34.54.3.45</li>
<li>My program crashes because that printer has the wrong firmware v578.651.26.21</li>
<li>My software crashes because you installed it on a D drive instead of a C drive</li>
<li>My software crashes because you added a space at the  of your name.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you as a developer already take into account how users make mistakes or even when the computer you install on will not be perfectly configured, you will be less on phone support and more time to develop new cool features.</p>
<p>The same for the code, if the code mimics how the user uses it then it is almost a one on one to test your code. I do not have enough time to explain this. </p></div>
