<p>Now is the question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you actually think that your best developers would stay in you team when that teams sucks every single project?</li>
<li>Do you really think that your best developers will stay in this team when a burn down graph every single day tries to make them feel like losers?</li>
<li>Since when did NERDs become social and have a group mentality?</li>
</ul>
<p>Agile/SCRUM teams tends to become below averaged developer teams. The good ones already escaped to better job, and you end up with bad ones are trapped into your team with no hope for anything better.</p></div>
