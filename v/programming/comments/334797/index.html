    <div class="md"><p>I have it in my head. What I visualize ends up on sticky notes. Stickys are great in general. Quick and simple, easy to acquire, and not bound by any limitations of random tools. E.g., I just thought about an authentication scheme. I drew a small login button, some steps as text or small 'images', and then a bunch of arrows. Doesn't need much more. Before you found those elements in some kind of tool, you either forgot it or took way longer than drawing a rectangle and putting some text into it.</p>
<p>In general, don't over-engineer on this level. If I had to share this stuff over the Internet with coworkers, I would probably use some kind of multiplayer paint and use it as whiteboard.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally, the most planning I do is to create the model first. So, I open MySQL Workbench (of alternate database equivalent) which has a diagram browser of the relational structure of the database.</p>
<p>This gives me a good idea of how to plan the project itself. Because 90% of the project is going to be determined by the structure of the model anyway.</p>
<p>After the model is created, often a scaffolding script can read the model and make a bare-bones prototype of how the program would roughly work.</p>
<p>I like this approach because the planning isn't just &quot;mental masturbation&quot; It actually creates a usable prototype which can be demonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> don't draw things out. Make a prototype of the model.</p></div>

When it's my project, I have to start with UI-screens mockups to make sure that my model doesn't just run-away and turn into a design-paralysis type of thing. That's just how my brain works, as you can see everyone has their own way of thinking.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That's fine, whatever floats your boat. I have a few problems with the &quot;Top Down via UI&quot; approach though.</p>
<p>The reason I don't draw things out is because I consider the UI &quot;marketing&quot;. For the same reason you wouldn't make the package for the toothbrush before you design the actual toothbrush. I won't design the interface before the model.</p>
<p>The model is the product. The UI is just what marketers use to sell the product.</p>
<p>UI is a subjective thing while the model is objective. Put 3 guys in a room and have them approve the UI and they will be there for hours arguing. Put them in a room with a model and</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They tend to think more rationally about what the NEED and less about what the WANT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They would rather get out of there because models are boring to pointy-haired-boss types.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, a project is likely to have multiple UIs, especially if it's a RESTful project. So, when I have a prototype of the model I just send the marketing guy the API and tell him to do what he wants with it. He can build a UI for web. He can build a UI for Android, etc.</p>
<p>Generally, I think UI should be considered separate projects in the same way designing a toothbrush is a separate project from designing a toothbrush package.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Notional Velocity. I need to be able to just type it out as it streams off of my consciousness. So far that's the only real productive tool I have found. Others have too many workflows which really break my concentration.</p>
<p>I also use &quot;Tree 2&quot; (OSX outliner) to better organize the chaos that can happen when a linear note gets too big. If I had to, I would write an app that makes breaking a linear note into a Tree system by merely selecting the text and letting it form a new window/bubble. Since ideas tend often sporadically spawn new categories.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I use Evernote (premium). I started using it years ago and it fell by the way side. I started using it wrong, so it didn't really work for me.</p>
<p>I fired it back up again a year or two ago, and have it organised in a way that parallels my workflow. The biggest thing that actually made it work and become so powerful was to put <strong>everything</strong> in it. I use the android app to photgraph handwritten notes, napkin sketches, etc., and if there's a key email I forward that to my evernote. I now have thousands of notes, but have used notebooks, titles, and tags to make it all searchable.</p>
<p>Why is it so powerful? I now have everything of import in a single place, so no more wondering if that thing was on a sticky note, email, whatever - I know I can find it easily in evernote. Also, I have a brain like a sieve, so I'm able to dump thoughts to evernote and get on with my life without worrying about forgetting things.</p>
<p>I know it doesn't work for everyone, but it you use it right (i.e. always) it can be very powerful.</p></div>
