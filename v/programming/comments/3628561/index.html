<p>'Consequently, executing WebAssembly code is much easier for the browser than executing JavaScript, since the translation distance from source code to machine code is greatly reduced. ' </p>
<p>'If we want to run WebAssembly outside of the browser, it’s only going to be useful if it can access basic things like files and network in a platform-independent way. ' </p>
<p>'They had no idea of what was to come, of what would be possible in the browser in the future. ' </p>
<p>'Despite the incredible amount of infrastructure and applications built with JavaScript, no one could say that it’s a perfect language. ' </p>
<p>'Consider all of this, along with the rise of the Single Page Application (SPA), and it’s easy to see how critical browser performance is to the modern web. '</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, let's reinvent javascript because we have so much junk going on in the browser that we need some more.</p>
<p>The current state of things is that &quot;web interface&quot; is a half backed stuff that works only when internet is active and depends on the latest and greatest Chrome browser to produce some meaningful results (without blockers) </p>
<p>Can we have some RELIABLE applications that are tested and WORK ?</p>
<p>In case you get irked, I am not talking of google apps, Google has enough manpower to actually have something that works.</p>
<p>I am talking about the big companies web, HP, netapp, cisco, etc. their websites are flashy but when you are searching for something.... you are screwed (unless you search for the latest gizmo, obfiously)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason all this junk keeps getting pushed is Jewgle, in case you're not aware. They want to own the internet--and the easiest way to do that is to buy and own or destroy everything they possibly can. Drive the standards bodies to make the latest and greatest before it's ready, making the standard itself terrible and allowing them to control what actually gets made. Slowly force your way deeper into the internet until nobody can work without your tech, and force everyone to have to keep up despite the changes being terrible (http2), or meaningless, or wrecks the solid foundation that used to exist so that they can move in and take control (QUIC). </p>
<p>Nobody wants to sell you a working application anymore. You're not the customer anymore, the half-brained brainwashed masses are. They buy anything the TV tells them to whether it works or not, and theres so many of them with so much government-granted money that it's a terrible choice to cater to anything else. Why fucking service people when you can rush Product™, spend half of what you save on liars and cheats and Marketing™, and make triple the money because the government is giving the niggers their gibs, and they Must Have their Product™. </p>
<p>Search is Useless™. Nobody wants you to <em>search</em> they want you to buy Product™ like the rest of the brainless retards that have infected the internet. So they intentionally gimp search, alter the search results, fill them with ads, point you anywhere but the actual knowledge you might be looking for. They don't make money <em>giving you knowledge</em>, Nobody™ wants knowledge, they want your data. They want to be able to sell you to (((them))). They want to control what you see, not <em>educate</em> you. </p>
<p>But what about manuals for old products? LMAO. They don't want you on old products they want you to give them money and things they can give Them for money. The harder they make it to get the stuff you actually want the more money they make, of course the search, old stuff, etc is garbage. It's made to be like that, otherwise you won't Consume™. </p>
<p>It's even better if they can let internal bureaucracy take over. While everyone's talking about left hand right hand niggershit they're making out like bandits with literal scads of cash, and when the old company implodes they can simultaneously make a disgusting killing on the stock market and force everyone to rebuy shit that should last from New Company™. Even better if they can do rounds of investing and pad their wallets a third time thanks to Startup Culture™. You get to steal from the suckers that call themselves employees and work overtime at minimal wage, the suckers that manage them, the suckers that buy your company shortly before it explodes, the suckers that think you're not doing this, and the suckers that think that your new startup that's basically plaster over wood instead of stone is worth millions. Even better if you can hire a bunch of streetshitters to keep the suckers in line and yes-man their way to get suckers with more money interested. </p>
<p>If anyone <em>actually</em> read google's TOS they would realize that at the bottom it says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protect against harm to ... the public as ... permitted by law.</p>
<p>Now, let's make the assumption that google is evil. And let's assume for the moment they're not interested in any modern techniques, they just want to Control The Public like good stupid evil people. Now, introducing Pavlov's Dogs. Classical Conditioning. Show event, provide reward. Show event, provide punishment. The effects are not conscious. They have control over your email, your search, and if you've got an android, your phone. They also have full license to manipulate you according to their policies. You speak about Them? Enjoy shitty search results. You don't even have to notice, the experience just has to suck. And slowly, when you try to think on your own life feels worse. You're not sure why, you're just sure that life's harder if you don't Buy Product™ or Espouse Good Politics™. </p>
<p>Attach sentiment-analysis driven AI, and now they can tell if you've said something positive or negative about them. Say something negative? Oops... all video ads. Call the wrong people? Google AMP™ stops working randomly. </p>
<p>They want control over your life, your money, and your mind, and they've <em>automated it</em>.</p></div>

<p>If your spending money fixing things your not making money. Meanwhile they have infinite fed money and can destroy whatever business you make and replace it with their own.</p></div>
