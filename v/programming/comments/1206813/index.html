<p>Then if you look into it you'll see something called &quot;stackoverflow careers&quot;. Now this in combination with having seen a person on stackoverflow with over 100k rep writing extremely newbish questions that generated a ton of traffic, therefore gaining him more rep, I thought to look up what was really going on on that website. I mean, they were blocking so many posts of mine I couldn't fucking do anything on the site, and it was so rife with that behavior I knew something was up. In my searching I found this article about the <a href="http://archive.is/hJDjO">decline of stackoverflow</a>. I think everyone who uses the site will find that a fantastic read, and I can personally confirm all but one of the claims made in the article.</p>
<p>I'm sick of these people learning about computer science and using their knowledge for selfish and evil gain; I'm referring to performing the expensive task (for a human) of spending linear to quadratic time to search through posts to have a look at what the high rep users have been censoring on the site - IF these posts can even be seen after they've been &quot;put on hold&quot; or &quot;marked as duplicate&quot; or whatever other excuse they have to block the question from letting a user gain rep. </p>
<p>If anyone here has posted on that site and had something marked as a duplicate you probably noticed that your post wasn't a duplicate. I think what those people on the site are doing is pretending to have researched your question thoroughly and have verified that <em>similar</em> question titles are exactly equal to the question you wrote (without even clicking to so much as glance at the content of the similar questions, let alone comprehensively analyze what how the questions are different). I'd move further to also claim that I believe the high rep users are trying to implicitly convey that they've fully comprehensively analyzed your question with the <em>similar</em> questions and you're simply wrong, and &quot;if you weren't wrong, how did I mark your question as a duplicate?&quot; </p>
<p>TLDR; stackoverflow is gamed by the webmasters for programmers to put on their stackoverflow account on their resumes to get jobs. They're creating artificially scarce high rep users by blocking competing users from gaining rep.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Stackoverflow has its ups and downs.</p>
<p>What you need to understand about SO is it's primarily aimed at finding solutions to obscure problems rather than stuff you can easily find via SO or Google search. Moreover, you need to provide clear cut info on what the issue is, and most importantly, what you have tried. This shows to the people there that you've taken some initiative to solving the problem and that you're not looking for a handout.</p>
<p>Simply put, don't ask questions which answers can be found easily and dont just post &quot;i need a script that does XY. K. Thx. Bye&quot;. SO community is for the most part quite toxic and nasty, but if you remember the above you should be fine.</p></div>

<p>I wasn't disputing this, and I did happen to specify in my OP that there are high rep users posting easy to answer questions. And they were very clearly getting away with doing this (and I presumed that meant it was appropriate) because they had a TON of them. And as you said, they answers were easily found in like the freaking android changelog ffs. They were questions that were so easily answered by using common sense to find the document that has always been the source for that sort of thing. This user was posting this stuff because they knew someone might simply google the question they used as the title for their post and so they'd get rep for traffic and upvotes for the post.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, and we know the story with SO. </p>
<p>As a side note, it's the same reason it's so irritating that google is censoring search results right now. Sure, they'll say google is a company and they can do whatever they want with their product, but when it gains that much influence over people's lives they better damn well believe the users of the service (everyone) have a say it what happens with it. There are families and people with serious careers using the service, their livelihood is at stake. Also, Eric Schmidt has been using google as his <a href="https://www.voat.co/v/FuckGoogle/comments/1180468">personal political influence device</a>... he deserves to burn.</p></div>

<p>Gamification is the use of game design techniques and mechanics to solve problems and engage audiences. […] Gamification works by … taking advantage of humans' psychological predisposition to engage in gaming. The technique can encourage people to perform chores that they ordinarily consider boring, such as completing surveys, shopping, or reading web sites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is. The game is the deletionist-style forum janitorial services, not the content generation.</p>
<p>The former is dull and routine, while the latter people clamor to share info and ask questions in a place where they'll be seen (as we can deduce from SO's original quick success). The benefits of playing the answers-and-comments part correctly is the ability to block other players from both sections of the reputation system.</p>
<p>I think that at some point, if not at the beginning, this became a deliberate decision on the part of the site's developers, which is why I linked to that article.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If that's part of what they're doing then that's really dumb. It's like buying a game, starting it up, and the game is illogically, inconsistently and arbitrarily difficult with impasses as the developers see fit. And if you come up with an original way to play the game (a new question) they block you, then can publish their own version as if they did it first or any other action after the player has been silenced and censored from speaking on the site...</p>
<p>That's all bad, and it's why I don't use the site anymore. If there are 2 sites in the search results I click the non-SO link.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I also really hate the attitude towards new users, as if the first thing you do when starting to program is make an account with them so if your account is new <em>you</em> must be new to programming. It also seems to have a perception that there is a constant accumulation of points over time, so if your account is past a certain age you should have a set amount of points or you must be stupid.</p>
<p>I still remember posting once about an SQL question, and while my answer wasn't the best it was one that I was using on a personal site at the time. I knew it worked but I still got the asinine comment of &quot;this is awful and won't work&quot;. No explanation as to why it shouldn't work, or how to improve it, just that it was wrong. I sarcastically replied that he should definitely have a sit down with my server then because it was obviously going outside the bounds of it's programming by working for me.</p></div>

<p>It gets corrupted just the same. I'm doing some stuff with the city council and they're breaking rules that are easily read and understood by any joe shmo off the street and they pretend they're coming to some sort of incomprehensible solution in their behind-the-scenes discussions and simply authoritatively dictate things to people. It's actually really wrecking the city I live in right now. Shockingly though, the state has intervened and told them what they're doing is illegal (on many occasions, and that's just what I know about), and one of their dirties deals has landed them under a corruption investigation by the state.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I don't think the &quot;duplicate&quot; complaint by Stack Overflow is (necessarily) as concerning as the &quot;irrelevant&quot; problem.  Now hear me out because I'm not saying that duplicate is bad by any means, and this is only one person's experience.</p>
<p>However, I have found that, whenever I have a programming question, and many times I have a theoretical computing question, I find an answer that is at least somewhat useful is from Stack Overflow on the first page of Google results.</p>
<p>And pushing 80% of the time that question is in some way marked as irrelevant, off-topic, or otherwise stating &quot;this question is low quality and/or beneath us.&quot;  I get this strange, instinctive feeling that I am, by far, <em>not</em> the only one who experiences this phenomenon.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed for some web sites on the Internet is an overwhelming zeal to improve their &quot;quality&quot; to the point it strangles the site.  This is often in more private venues, but Stack Overflow is a very prominent and public example of this, and it's been like this for several years.  They're increasing the &quot;quality&quot; and narrowing the &quot;scope&quot; to the point that, sooner or later, <em>questions</em> are going to be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Also, as a note, lest anyone say &quot;it's been asked before!&quot;, just because someone asked it eight years ago does not mean it does not warrant a new explanation.  It is unreasonable to ask someone to plunge through the archives of a web site for 12 hours in the vain hope of finding some question that's already been asked.  Always has been.  It kind of defeats the purpose of asking the question when they could beat their head against the wall for 12 hours while trying to read official documentation and/or textbooks and probably have about the same odds of &quot;getting it.&quot;  This particular problem is not limited to Stack Overflow, either, but as with &quot;improve quality onto death,&quot; it is a prominent example of it.</p>
<p>Thank you for calling them out on their bullshit.  I would have considered doing so a long time ago, but this attitude has made me want to only look at the site for questions and not actually participate (and be berated for doing so).</p></div>

<p>Omg, so much this. I've been repeating this shit to professors and people on SO for <em>years</em> and they sit there and pretend I'm some sort of mentally retarded person whom they hate for proposing such a thing. I'm going to publicly rip my professors at the university I graduated from a giant new asshole. And then I'm going to rub salt in the skin tears.</p>
<p>Anyways, yeah, if they're trying to &quot;improve&quot; their site they're doing a bad job of it, and I have expressed to them multiple times that there is something wrong with the site. You should have seen that shitstorm. The posts got like 25-30+ downvotes, they must have been sharing the link with their high rep buddies that they know IRL because the flames were massive, the fuckers started doxxing me (this is all on the very first post I made on meta), they went and deleted one of my accounts.. I mean, I think they honestly believe they're doing all this stuff and think people are bowing down to them and submitting without realizing their fuckery. If I didn't know they were completely wrong before, I did then with all that backlash... there IS <em>NO</em> WAY the nail wasn't hit right on the head. Love watching wrong-doers squirm, I'll tell you that.</p>
<p>Also, I have seen the useful posts marked duplicate before or whatever other tag they would like to insult the poster with. Problem is: when it gets marked that people can't post, so I think the answer was given before a rep-whore mod got a chance to intercept the points/block someone from gaining rep. I mean, it's definitely all about rep it's like lemon11 <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/1206813/5964683">said</a>, it's gamified; and some users have gained an unfair advantage and would like to pretend their number one on the highscore board (that people can see and observe their almighty godliness as world's best programmer - or whatever it is they believe others will believe by looking at that).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm not really seeing your complaint. Stock Overflow is a resource and the question is whether or not it does a good job at that. As I think most any developer could attest to, the answer is yes. I don't really care what high karma, point, or whatever they call their little numbers people are doing. I do know at least some of the very high karma users are very deserving of it. If you program in C#, there's a very high chance Jon Skeet has answered at least one of your questions and he has about a billion magical points, so good for him. If companies are genuinely hiring people because of a SO score without having the intelligence to verify that their content is meritorious then they are probably the last people you'd want to work for anyhow.</p></div>
