To me the interface and layout of the site was pretty confusing, I even tried a few of the sites guide/tutorials.

<p>Here is my current profile. <a href="https://github.com/cooledcannon">https://github.com/cooledcannon</a> I dont even have a complete understanding of what I did, so basically it was me trying to figure shit out. </p>
<p>I already have learned the basics of languages like C# and Python and have dabbled in HTML/CSS/JS, Jquery and Angular tutorials. Best projects I did were simple games like Breakout/Pong in unity using C#. </p>
<p>If you have more general advice about jobsearching/work etc it would be much appreciated. I have not completed highschool/college and pretty much have no work experience =/. I live in Auckland, NZ.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Here comes my unfiltered opinion/advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move away from xp, it's propably the best to learn linux, but win7/8 or OS x are used in the industry too.</li>
<li>Actually learn how to use git, not just the website.</li>
<li>If you are coding something that you don't mind others seeing, put it up. Even if it is not terribly complicated or innovating.</li>
<li>Focus on what you want to code. Webdev keeps growing, but there are a <strong>lot</strong> of web developers out there, usually with years of experience. If you feel like you can catch up with them, by all means. Try to choose something and practice until you excel at it, knowing the basics 10 languages is worse than being great in one. You mentioned C#, it's currently the 4th most sought after skill in programming by employers. Take courses online: <a href="https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-8295">Microsoft codeacademy</a> is one example, but there are many more out there. When you know one language and understand most of the concepts of programming, then you can start taking on other languages. Other popular languages are Java, Ruby, Python (Although that's a saturated market in some places, a lot of people get python in uni), ...</li>

    <div class="md"><p>My plan is to do something in python as it seems significantly easier and faster to code than C#. But since Im familiar with it, it should give me the flexibility to do something in C# or Java or something like that if I so please. </p>
<p>I guess my main sticking points are, which projects should I work on, and where should I apply for work. But thanks for the advice.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea what the education system is like in NZ, but if its anything like the US there is no such thing as programming in school curriculum until maybe senior year of high school, freshman year college in a CS program.</p>
<p>Try to sign up for any decent programming course in high school. In the US they have &quot;AP classes&quot; which are pretty well accepted courses which are classes high schoolers can take in preparation for an end of year exam which some colleges will use to apply credit for certain courses. For example in the US if I took an AP English class and scored a 5 on it I could go to a lot of colleges with that info and receive credit towards my degree for an english class if I enrolled there.</p>
<p>If your high school has an option to take something similar, try to take an AP computer science class. Or look into if your high school has &quot;dual enrollment&quot; options with a local college. My high school had an agreement with a local college that I could take courses at the college on the high school's dime and receive both high school credit and college credit for the course. I ended up going to that same college that i took dual enrollment courses from so that worked out great.</p>
<p>If you come out of high school with CS related course already on a college transcript, that looks great even if the college you choose to attend doesn't accept it as transfer credits.</p>
<p>As for what to do for work, I'm from the US so I can't speak to how it works in NZ but it's probably not too far off: Usually colleges have job fairs. go to the college fair with a resume, wear a shirt and tie and look professional, show them a CV/resume/whatever you have. Go to your high school/local college's career center, ask them to help you make a resume, tell them your situation and that you want to do programming work. I don't know how they'd react but if they're not douches they'll help you out to give you tips on how to write your resume well and even edit it with you in person.</p>
<p>This is assuming you have at least a page worth of content that you can fill out into a nice looking document.</p>
<p>Once you get to college start going to career fairs, go to literally all the places offering programming internships and talk to every rep. tell them about yourself, as long as you don't lie to them they won't be douches. Maybe they'll be terse and say they're looking for a more experience person but that's just how it goes for an inexperienced high school grad, it's nothing personal to your character. Companies like to pick up college seniors so they can groom them for full time positions so the closer you are to graduating the more a company will try to snag you, on top of having more experience from classes in college. The hardest step is getting your foot in the door as an inexperienced freshman/sophomore, but if you talk to as many people as possible and express enthusiasm, and show them you have some experience with their set of tools so they don't literally have to teach you how to program, you have a good shot at getting a job.</p></div>

<p>Stick ubuntu on your fucking computer - FYI, my macbook from '08 is blazing fucking fast and I develop loads on it and it runs Yosemite. My rMBP is awesome an all but realize that plastic laptops are a false economy.</p>
<p>Now go get a $5 USB stick and run lubuntu on your fucking shitty laptop and go through a 101 git/github tutorial and then look at a good solid &quot;branch merge and patch&quot; workflow for git.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Management minor here. Your hiring manager, or HR person, won't have a clue how to use Github. Just hand them a cheap flash drive with EXE files on it that they don't have to install, and that they can run from a flash drive. Even that will be super challenging for them. </p>
<p>You can tell them you know how to use versioning software (Github) but don't make them to stuff with Github. </p>
<p>Seriously, you can get a 4GB usb flash drive for about $2. </p>

<p>If I was going that route I pretty much have three projects down(Pong, a simple 2D moving a ball game, a simple 3D minecraft like game with less features) and have it ready to go. That leads me to my next question- where(what sorts of companies) should I apply to? I really dont mind a relatively bad job in terms of work/pay as long as I get started somewhere. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought I wanted to write games, but doing research tells me that its underpaid, overworked, has crunch and long hours etc. So definitely not. </p>
<p>I think I would want to do business software, it should be interesting enough and pretty meaningful. I think my strengths are that I learn and think pretty quickly. 5 year plan- start anywhere, ideally get trained doing something cool, then keep working my way up. </p></div>

<p>Otherwise, just work on whatever you are interested in. Eventually, you'll have a portfolio.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Every day you commit to a repository on github you get a green square. You have one green square because you committed some code on that day.</p>
<p>It could be on one of your projects, or a collaborative project with someone else. As long as you are committing code to Github, you are creating a provable record of work. Employers like to see that.</p></div>
