<p>I'm Nujabes, a 5th year undergraduate majoring in IT with a minor in IS. I enjoy programming a lot and want to enhance my skills in programming. The problem is, I tend to learn a programming language's basics then from there I get bored of the language and move onto another one.</p>
<p>What I WANT to do is take a language and actually create something out of it. Something interesting or fun/funny. I need some guidance in how to start.</p>
<p>The languages I know are Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, Java, MongoDB, Node, and Git.</p>
<p>One thing I want to do is create an app for my Pebble Time watch to check on upcoming times for the NJTransit. I dunno how possible that is but that's one thing I do want to do. Another is to start up a website for motivation. I already have a youtube channel I'm working on for motivating others and want to try and make a business out of that.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a bit broad or something but I just want to really get myself going on growing in programming. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance and have a fantastic day!</p></div>

<p>Create a need to learn, and then everything will fall into place.</p>
<p>For 8 years now, I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails. I would get as far as <code>rails generate my_blog</code> and then stop. Then I took on a contract job in which I promised a client  a user authenticated Rails app. The contract provided 2 things that I never had before when learning Rails: 1) because I had to explain my development plan to the client, I thought through and documented how I was going to design and implement this app. Doing so provided a clear direction on my path to learning Ruby on Rails. 2) Because my bank account would be affected on my performance, I was sincerely motivated to turn out good work in short time.</p>
<p>I can't just write code for the hell of it. There has to be a compelling reason behind it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The best thing to do would be to join a project with experienced devs.</p>
<p>I have some open source projects with some entry level / low commitment work that might be good training for you. I'd be willing to mentor you in exchange for contribution.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Pebble, but I can get you started on some web stuff, or game engine stuff.</p>
<p>PM me if interested.</p></div>
