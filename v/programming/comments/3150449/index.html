<p>This is why I'm thinking about getting a postgraduate diploma in software testing from a good University. This would take me about a year, but I'd like to get an ISTQB certification. It's always a plus from what I've seen. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to get any experience? I've been involved in several IT projects, so I could always lie I did some testing there, e. g. wrote test cases, etc. I guess it's the only way nowadays. </p>
<p>What programming language would you recommend me for test automation? Java, Python? Would JS be good, too?</p>
<p>Any advice? What do you guys think?</p></div>
