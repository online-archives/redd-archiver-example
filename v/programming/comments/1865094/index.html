    <div class="md"><p>So jQuery is still quite relevant to the internet, it's not been replaced? </p>
<p>Edit: Online literature seems to suggest that one should put it into a folder and reference that folder/file in a &lt;script&gt; command whenever jQuery is needed. Since I'm beginning I'm guessing it would be prudent to just host it in my localhost?</p>
<p>Edit2: After downloading a <em>jquery-3.2.1.js</em> file to localhost and altering the referencing of a script that I had found on StackOverflow to test if jQuery was working it apparently works... w00t.</p></div>
