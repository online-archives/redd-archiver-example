    <div class="md"><p>the problem with stuff like this is that it creates a demand for people who will do as instructed. want to watch an american firm that pays decent move to india? just have enough of its US employees refuse to do the ordered tasks on moral principle. i can see why someone might not write straight up illegal code, but unethical code is 1) subjective and 2) strategic. sometimes some unethical code is simply a legal loophole to get around an unethical law. sometimes an unethical code is unethical to person A but not to more reasonable person B. </p>
<p>so i am going to call bullshit on this whole article. will businesses do unethical things? yes they will. but you know who is really at fault? their fucking customers. YOU need to vote with your money, and YOU need to be a customer of ethical businesses. what you purchase matters. </p></div>

<p>as for the fed, well we can't do much about that. but you can invest in bitcoin and the like to take monetary power out of their hands. as for unethical collusion. consider this, in a capitalist world of competition if business A cheats to cut a bigger profit than business B, than it can drive business B out of the market. over time this creates business survival selection pressure for unethical businesses. this all relies on rules keeping the system rigged or it relies on free trade with competition on uneven playing fields. </p>
<p>so can you get rid of unethical business altogether? nope, not in this world you can't. but you can draw your own moral lines and support this business and not that business. </p>
<p>keep in mind the fundamental problem of subjective morality and ethics. what is unethical to person A is not unethical to person B. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think would happen to the Japanese culture, if sjws got ahold of their media and brought in sub-Saharan cannibals as examples of ethics and morals.... the ethics and morals you have been programmed to accept are substandard, not up to par, and a reason to minimize and displace you with anyone other than another European American male, because now incompetent standards are somehow acceptable, you could probably be replaced with a pet rock or a cockroach or a bedbug if you lower your standards and expectations enough..... this is why mind control drugs like fluoride are heavily used successfully,  you are an accepting of anything example$$$$$.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>funny you pick japanese culture, i like a lot of their morals and principles. a lot of what we would consider to be &quot;immoral&quot; they would consider to be personal matters. they have more social acceptance of liberty, but it is expected to be kept in quiet while putting up a polite public persona. in this manner they have both respect for each other and civility while still allowing for a wide variety of individual preferences. but they are caving to US and EU trade cannibals which are trying to crush their liberty. </p>
<p>japan will resist SJW culture, because it attacks public persona and personal liberty. it would be detrimental to their work ethic. work hard, play hard. besides the women there have no desire to work as hard as the men do. </p></div>

<p>Programmers confess unethical, illegal tasks asked of them - Business Insider </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'&quot;Unfortunately, many of todayâ\x80\x99s software developers are self-taught or are learning through so-called 'coding bootcamps,'&quot; says Sourour. ' </p>
<p>'The focus is on pumping out people who can write code as fast as possible to satisfy a growing and insatiable market for coding skills,&quot; he adds. ' </p>
<p>'But Martin pointed out, &quot;The weird thing is, it was software developers who wrote that code. ' </p>
<p>'Decades later, he still feels guilty about it, he told Business Insider. ' </p>
<p>'He pointed out that &quot;there are hints&quot; that developers will increasingly face some real heat in the years to come. ' </p>

<p>Wait scratch that. This is the problem with our whole species. A great many humans are willing to forego moral concerns for financial gain. Or is it a problem of society emphasizing and encouraging financial gain at all costs?  Or both?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole thing is silly bullshit, honestly. Bill Sourour was a little pansy for writing the article BI is talking about. I won't argue that ethical dilemmas in programming don't exist, but Sourour's wasn't real. Basically this comes down to what everyone else here is saying; if the programmer doesn't write the code, the company will find someone else who does. It's not an ethical dilemma to do your fucking job (in the case of Sourour).</p></div>
