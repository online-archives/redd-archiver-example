    <div class="md"><p>Everyday resembles Atlas Shrugged more and more. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you know the hallmark of a second rater? It's resentment of another man's achievement. Those touchy mediocrities who sit trembling lest someone's work prove greater than their own - they have no inkling of the loneliness that comes when you reach the top. The loneliness for an equal - for a mind to respect and an achievement to admire. They bare their teeth at you from out of their rat holes,thinking that you take pleasure in letting your brilliance dim them - while you'd give a year of my life to see a flicker of talent anywhere among them. They envy achievement, and their dream of greatness is a world where all men have become their acknowledged inferiors. They don't know that that dream is the infallible proof of mediocrity, because that sort of world is what the man of achievement would not be able to bear. They have no way of knowing what he feels when surrounded by inferiors - hatred? no, not hatred, but boredom - the terrible, hopeless, draining, paralyzing boredom. Of what account are praise and adulation from men whom you don't respect? Have you ever felt the longing for someone you could admire? For something, not to look down at, but up to?&quot;
&quot;I've felt it all my life,&quot; she said.” 
― Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we have <strong>further evidence that there is measurable bias against women in computer science</strong>. Women who work in CS have to be better prepared and perform more competently than men in order to survive, and therefore it should come as no surprise that the few women who contribute to open source projects are more skilled than their male counterparts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So women doing BETTER because their Github contribs are accepted more is... proof that women are discriminated against...... how the fuck they got to that conclusion is only possible to an SJW brain. </p>
<p><strong>So if women's Github contributions were accepted less it would be proof that women are discriminated against. Since women's Github contributions are accepted more, it's still proof that women are discriminated against.</strong> Feminists make no sense.</p></div>

When it gets this blatant, it seems inevitable that even mainstream opinion will come round eventually. It's like the boy who cried wolf. Remember when everyone thought D&amp;D was a satanic ritual? People at large seem credulous at first, but they cotton on eventually.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The Graph on the right in Fig. 5 is interesting. At first I thought it was important that for outsiders the acceptance rate is lower for known females and higher for unidentified female contributors.</p>
<p>Then I noticed something far more obvious. The acceptance rate for gender neutral contributors is ridiculously higher than for either type of known gender. Is there a ridiculous bias against anyone who clearly identifies themselves?</p>
<p>If you look closely at these chart's you'll see that the vertical is zoomed in tightly. The differences between the genders are only 1%‐3%. The difference between known genders and gender neutral is still about 10%, which is odd, but there is definitely no widespread bias against either gender here. A small handful of project maintainers could be biased against women they don't know and cause that difference. It could be a statistical anomaly.</p>
<p>Now I'm wondering why identifying yourself enough to discern gender makes you 10% less likely to have a pull request accepted as an outsider.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The conclusion - &quot;we have evidence of bias against women&quot; - is a bit strange, and should really be evidence of a bias against outsiders of known gender. As for the theory of survivorship bias, that seems pretty clear. Considering that males outnumber females by an order of magnitude, there is far greater competition between the males. More competition means even the most skilled programmers have to withstand peer scrutiny, and many of those peers are, quite frankly, retarded monkeys.</p></div>
