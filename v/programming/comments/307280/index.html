    <div class="md"><p>I'm doing some self directed full stack education and I've come to really appreciate what this site has to offer, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Test driven practice problems. You code to pass the script, which forces you to think about your approach.</li>
<li>Exercises are downloaded and submitted via command line.</li>
<li>Once you submit your code it's put out on the community for people to leave feedback on your code.</li>
<li>The problems don't lead you by the hand, which is good if you are at a point where you know how to write code and just need something to practice daily with. The tests are often structured in a way that encourages you to explore your language's library to find the best way to solve the problem.</li>
<li>There are a lot of languages supported.</li>
</ol>
<p>Come check it out if you're looking for something that can help improve your programming skills. The community has a lot of users, but we could use more people to give feedback on other people's work.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>What test/language/os?</p>
<p>I've been doing Python on Windows and I did the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have the language libraries you are trying to do installed and add to the windows PATH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cd in to the directory the test file and the file you made for the test is stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>type language keyword and the name of the test file (for my Python stuff its: python &lt;name of test file&gt;.py, make sure the other file and method names of your submission match what the test file is importing and calling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If done correctly you should get some feedback in the command prompt indicating if all test passed or how many failed. My instructions are for Windows and Python specifically (I've also done some JavaScript), so you might want to look on their site for more info about doing this on other OS's/other languages. </p>
<p>Also, just in case you are just starting out programming I would consider these tests a bit much. You'd likely want to start with some <a href="http:\codeacademy.com">codeacademy</a> or <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Team Treehouse</a> to get the basics down. Other than that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nt1dXuYeqKA">this youtube video</a> shows how to get setup and use it.</p></div>

<p>I gave up and started with C++ and got that rolling.  I have never used gradle and when it fails it really fails.  It said it didn't show me 43 failures in a ~10 test file lol.  I think it is actually the test failing but it says that it is failing with toString which I don't even have.</p></div>

I've just started a new project and quickly found that I really know just about nothing about how to actually develop something, but I tend to learn by doing, so here goes! Thanks!</p></div>
