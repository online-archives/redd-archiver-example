    <div class="md"><p>In my own case I know why. My earliest code was bad because I didn‘t yet know how to logically divide code into separate, independent pieces.</p>
<p>It didn’t help that in my early days I was doing Windows programming. The win32 API was intentionally designed to be onerous to hinder small competitors. Any experienced programmer would build a wrapper around it for whatever he is working on. I was not experienced, so my code tended to be long sections of hard to read win32 function calls.</p>
<p>I also had few comments because at the time I was writing it those win32 function calls made perfect sense to me. I assumed I would still remember what they are later. Another amateur mistake.</p></div>

<p>But somewhere just a few years ago, I can look back and I <em>do</em> understand what I was trying to do, and how, and why.</p>
<p>I think that indicates improvement!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that's why, over the years, I've developed some techniques that help to make code understandable.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This seems backwards, but <strong>NO</strong> comments. If code is so complicated it needs to be explained, it is a good indication that it needs to be broken up into smaller pieces. So break it up into functions and literally name that function what you would have said in the comment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No code longer than 1 page scroll (This is a loose rule). If you can't see everything that needs to be understood on 1 page, again, it's a good indication that it needs to be broken up into logical families, like classes. Furthermore, classes can usually be broken down further into an MVC or other similar paradigm so, you aren't bombarded by unnecessary information (like the view) when you are working in the model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always use long descriptive variable names. Never abbreviate unless the variable is a temporary variable or an iterator. Ex. tmp, or i</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep it bone DRY. DRY requires breaking code up. Breaking code up means descriptive class and function names. The code is literally readable because it is telling you exactly what it is doing.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I read it and am saddened by how much happier I used to be. It all used to be so much more fun.</p>
<p>Frameworks are all about &quot;magic&quot; plumbing that shuttles your data from one place to the next in a completely obscure way. All in the interest of saving you time. Of course, it ain't free, it's paid for by all the extra cruft put in place to make it all happen.</p>
<p>Agile is responsible for a lot of it. When you have interchangeable developers instead of people that focus on what suits them best, all of a sudden you need tools to that even the weakest database guy can get his database tasks done. Agile never fixed the mistrust between stakeholder and developer, it just tied the developer's hands. Terms like &quot;polish the cannonball&quot; are used to beat down and suppress the desire to do things beautifully and just turn software development into a machine in and of itself.</p></div>

<p>Agile is responsible for a lot of it. When you have interchangeable developers instead of people that focus on what suits them best, all of a sudden you need tools to that even the weakest database guy can get his database tasks done. Agile never fixed the mistrust between stakeholder and developer, it just tied the developer's hands.

A lot of my older code was more ambitious than what I do today - I was trying things which I didn't know how to do already, so you can easily see where the grand plan wasn't fully formed yet.</p></div>
