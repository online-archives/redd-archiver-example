I got fed up enough to quit my job and build a platform to help creative developers/engineers/etc take pledges to help them build awesome stuff. I would love your thoughts because I'm pouring my blood, sweat, and tears into this -- and all my money.</p>
<p>It's called Baqqer: <a href="https://baqqer.com/">https://baqqer.com</a></p>
<p>It's super new, might have some bugs, but I'm really reaching out and honestly trying to provide something valuable. If you're a developer, engineer, maker, creative, whatever --  it would in theory help you quit your job to work on your passions full time. Try it out, give me your thoughts, and I promise to make this beautiful together. </p>
<p>I'm here and happy to answer or help out. Thanks for taking a look. :)</p></div>

<li>a.) It's all sent securely through our payment processor. Since it's continuous crowdfunding (subscription-based model) backers are charged monthly, and creators bank deposits once a month as well. </li>
<li>b.) Instant transfers do happen inside of &quot;mini-campaigns&quot; creators can make. These are typically used for one-off tool/material requests that aren't in the current budget. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>You can still get pledges. This is a super early beta. I do plan on providing all the copy thoroughly explaining how all of this works. </p>
<p>I'm working on issuing variable ownership SAFE warrants until an equity event occurs. (you build a product and take it to market, etc) It's all optional at this point (or will be).
Converting participation/pledges into warrants probably will be limited to friends/family until the SEC/FINRA finalizes their rules on Title III of the JOBS act. This should happen sometime before/beginning 2016.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>What happens when a backer charges back or payment fails?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back charges suck for everyone. They can be disputed but it's a pain and costs real money if you lose the dispute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The website is essentially selling virtual stock. 
You can accept regular pledges without the option for participating in variable equity SAFE warrants. I'm going to have to change the rules on participation until some rules are passed by the SEC in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>you added that it's the obligation of the campaign runner to provide what they owe. Do you plan on adding a section where it explains what the % of product owned actually is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you clarify this?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually go with Django. I haven't hosted anything production at this point, just building pet projects. Though, I'm currently working on a resume website with cms capabilities and comments. I don't have the code hosted on a repo yet, but it's fully functional. I need to pretty it up a bit and fix some minor bugs.</p></div>
