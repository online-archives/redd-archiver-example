    <div class="md"><p>Very true, I'm a new grad who has been interviewing around and at first I was getting my ass handed to me. I wasn't expecting some of the simple data structures and other questions. The reality is, if you can't answer these questions, chances are someone else interviewing were able to. And guess who they're gonna favor. I've finally landed an interview with a big company (not big 4, but close) and I've got a 3 hour interview next week. Only hope is to study most of this week to be best prepared for any related questions. </p></div>

<p>That's the key.</p>
<p>Nobody needs a bubble-sort implementer. They need proof that you retain at least some of the concepts of &quot;data structures&quot; and &quot;algorithms&quot; so that they have a reasonable expectation that when you are presented with problems whose solutions will involve those things, you will have some idea of where to begin and will be able to use <em>your</em> time to solve the problem, instead of taking up <em>other employees' time</em>.</p></div>

<p>But here is the thing, you ask me the question and give me the time and Internet. I will come back an give you not only different variations of what you asked, I will probably also create a new one you never seen before that is even better.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of those seem to be missing the point (or they suffered through whiteboard interviews that missed the point). A whiteboard interview shouldn't be about your ability to recall language- or library-specific interfaces. It should be about your ability to understand and solve a problem.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to get the length of a string in Python 3, that's not a problem. If you don't know that getting the length of a string <em>is a thing you can do</em>, then <em>that's</em> a problem.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. If you do not remember the standard syntax/API, just define a syntax/API of your choice and use it consistently. Serious interviewers are interested in being able to solve problems given whatever interface fate shoves down your throat. Sure, some will only care about the exact syntax of some library, but you don't want to work for such idiots in the first place. That library is likely to be obsolete in a few years.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think white board is fine as long as the expectations are rational. I think Google has a reputation for looking for a specific algorithm rather than assessing problem solving ability. If you need something to be fast you'd research it anyways or an architect would specify the algorithm. The correctly remember a specific algorithm exercise doesn't really have real world applications but hiring is a mistake minimizing activity not a hiring maximizing one. </p></div>
