      <div class="md"><p>There are two competing methodological approaches in software development today. The approach often idealized by corporate types is what I call the ‘million monkeys approach’. That’s the approach where each project takes 10 times more engineers to complete the same project, but allows those engineers to be mediocre (or moreso <em>requires</em> them to be as such lest they start pointing out too many obvious engineering problems). This results in code bases that are a horrific mess, a work environment that is totally politicized, legitimate engineering concerns that are ignored or punished for being raised, and an order of magnitude more cost. Once all the non-code-monkey level of talent jumps ship (and right soon), only through sheer throughput of human misery does the project get shipped — often months or years behind.</p>
