    <div class="md"><p>Last time I did any work using scrum the manager decided we all lied about the estimated time to completion and took each of us to task then said we &quot;agreed&quot; to knock 50% to 66% of the estimated time off the timeframe. Then he started pestering and nagging us to twice daily complete a document listing what we've done so far. After 3 days into what was meant to be a 3 month long part time project we all left and never went back.</p>
<p>Ended up being a real shit show because it was a project done in cooperation between my colleges engineering department and its business center that hosted this fuckers pet project (a fitness / smart watch / internet of things wonder product). We were meant to not do the work of professionals but build a rough proof of concept prototype over the course of a semester but he wanted it done asap to well some pretty fucking ridiculous standards for college students because he was desperate to pitch the idea to investors, we completed the project to our original spec on the original timeframe (because we needed to finish something to get a grade) but made doubly sure the college did not give him anything from the project. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Similar thing happened to me. Design and development of an app for a small startup with backing from a large technology company. Gave original estimate of 6 weeks in the best of chances but realistically between 7-8 weeks for iterations and testing.</p>
<p>Start pestering me within days. Daily meetings with management and leads that have no technical knowledge. No one even understands the framework that was chosen. App had to have administrative privilege built in along with encryption. No one understands what the hell that means.</p>
<p>2 weeks and abour 20 meetings later being lambasted and told to hurry up. Cannot sleep due to stress and constant code filling my dreams. Given ultimatum that 4 weeks needs to be ready to be tested. All styling finished and corporate was going to be reviewing project.</p>
<p>3.5 weeks in and there is no way to finish and several scrum meetings a day forces me to never get anywhere.  Finished with some faggot know it all telling me how disappointed he is in my performance. I was seriously thinking of reaching across the table and destroying his face. Told them to go fuck themselves and the invoice was being emailed immediately. Fucking administration that has zero knowledge using scrum and agile as shackles. The project never completed in time and they lost their backers all because of this toxic mentality. </p></div>
