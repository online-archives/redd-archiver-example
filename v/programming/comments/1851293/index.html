    <div class="md"><p>I work at a company where 100% of everything before  I got here was done by indian programmers. Needless to say everything they programmed was as shitty as the ganges river.  Over the course of 6 months I cleaned up the entire project and turned it into an actually usable, sellable, product.  I'm honestly super lazy but management thinks i'm the greatest programmer in the world because all they have to compare me to are the retarded indians before me.  They let me get away with pretty much anything because they think im so invaluable and irreplaceable. I smoke weed at work pretty much every day and on &quot;bring your daughter to work day&quot; I brought my gf to work, told everyone she was my daughter, and then fucked her on my desk in the afternoon.  I mean, they hired a bunch of programmers who litterally shit in the same river they drink from. What did they expect the end result to look like?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>At the company I used to work at, the owner, being a money-grubbing s.o.b., hired five Indian programmers to write our new application.  The program manager (white guy) was lazy and careless, and he didn't do his job of checking the results of each of the Indian people.  Everything the Indians wrote was shit.  The owner, not being a fundamentally honest person, refused to face the fact that he had fucked up by hiring these cheap-ass Indians who only wanted to get out of India and weren't concerned about actually producing usable code.  This &quot;new version&quot; crap got started in 2002.  By 2009, all the Indians were gone and just about all of what they wrote had to be laboriously fixed or just scraped and done over from scratch.  It was an enormous waste of time, money and opportunity.  We were one of the leaders of our market when the re-write started but the company's fortunes are going down the drain now.  The owner thought he was a smart s.o.b. but it turns out he was dumb-ass of the first degree.  Oh, and he hired an Indian as CFO and all this guy did was constantly badger the owner for raises.  
</p>
<p>I actually have a very low opinion of Indians now.  The Hindoos who came into India thousands of years ago were white, and they established the first civilization in India.  Since then, race-mixing has steadily lowered the Indian IQ and what we get are these semi-smart cunning liars who get their H-1B's and then pretend they can do computer work.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The 36% number is pushed by people who can't math worth a fuck. <strong>The actual number is 2.1%</strong>!</p>
<p>The dumb editor added 14% and 22% for the 36%. That's completely wrong. Only 2.1% could perform at the intersection of both problems. Only 14% could solve the problems at all.</p>
<p>My experience places it at around 0.05%. Comments from others I've worked with, at lower tiers, say that they see around 2% of Indians are worth a damn. So it seems as the technical complexity increases the odds of an Indian performing satisfactory decreases dramatically. Even for basic grunt work, the odds of success are fairly low.</p>
<p>Really underscores the idiocy of pure fraud of the H1B program.</p></div>

<p>Only 36% could write code any code that would compile at all, not taking into account whether it would run without crashing, was correct, or solved the problem.</p>
<p>This was of two simple toy problems given to them. 36% were able to write code that compiled for one or both. However only 14% were able to write compilable code for both toy problems.</p>
<p>But it's worse than that. Less than 5% could write <strong>correct</strong> code that <em>actually solved the problem</em> and didn't crash.</p>
<p>And most of those guys wrote code that, although correct, had terrible performance. Only 2% could write correct code that was reasonably efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recently 'had my position terminated' after 9 months as a senior dev. LAMP stack, mainly DevOps type of work, ranging from diagnosing server issues to debugging jquery to dealing with their proprietary feed system (php and MySQL). About 50 people work there, its in SoCal, and theyre pretty profitable. </p>
<p>There is a healthy mix of people. Asian, white, indian, hispanic. No blacks though.</p>
<p>There is this one shining example of diversity that recently came back from maternity leave after 13 months. Yes, thirteen. First day back I get to meet her, and she cant understand a single word I said. I politely exited the conversation and promptly forgot about her. In my mind, she was just a non-entity. Never interacting except with another indian, never contributing, never socializing.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. My position is terminated because 'its just not the right fit.' Not a performance reason. Just, I dont fit in as well as the non english speaking, 13 month maternity leave, non contributing indian.</p>
<p>Yeah, I sold my login info to a hacker site this week. Call it my severance package, fucks.</p></div>

<p>Holy shit you are a slave morality faggot. The state controls the value of the currency. The state can devalue the US Dollar the same way China and other shit countries do. The lower the value of your currency relative to other currencies, the more your exports and jobs go up, because foreigners can afford to buy more of your shit, and foreign companies can open up cheaper factories in your country. </p>
<p>So it isn't the case that the only thing to blame is yourself. You can blame China for devaluing its currency and other countries for having shit labor laws. You can blame American entrepreneurs for chasing after risky higher returns in foreign countries instead of taking lower, but safer returns domestically. You can blame the American government for making the American job market and environment so shit for businesses. And you can blame Indians for coming to America to work instead of staying in India and improving their homeland.</p>
<p>The last person you should ever blame for anything is yourself, unless it is an accident you made directly. Government policy is out of your control.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Breh. You can be creative, technical, minimal, controversial, the list goes on, and make money. Are you trying to say it's healthy to blame problems on others? Sounds like people we don't take kind to here you pussy fart. You're flimsy as shit.</p>
<p>These things you blame are huge forces. Either do something or shut up. Evolution has always existed. When a cold winter came to primitive humans did everyone say oh well we'll all die ill blame the winter? Doesn't matter. But the people that stocked up, had formidable shelter, etc got through it. Do illegal non violent shit if you don't agree with the laws. I don't give a fuck as long as you provide for yourself.  
</p>
<p>If you're value added and interesting you'll have opportunities. Maybe not go out every weekend and have a brand new iPhone every release, but opportunities. Don't settle if you don't want. But don't be entitled either you pathetic victim.</p>
<p>I agree I'm not getting to down on yourself (blame) if opportunity passes. Keep looking for it. Later Sally. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This would be interesting if there weren't so many people in the industry already trying to put down other people for small, easily fixable instances where code doesn't compile. Sometimes people made a small change and didn't build before checking in code or a single file is excluded from the check in and people go &quot;REEEEE anon's code didn't compile. REEEEE anon can't code REEEEE give me a raise now for identifying this and clearly I'm king coder for writing code that compiles. No one has ever said this about ME!&quot; even though they might have made the same mistake a dozen times and simply covered it up.</p>
<p>So this article doesn't really mean much.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with having the machine grade it. That's what ALL my profs in college did and it was retardedly brittle and they'd use naive programmer technique to do one thing: do an exact string comparison at the end of the program for all or no credit.... i never fucked with that &quot;get every single character right&quot; shit, good thing my programming partner was behind me in skill and i did the bulk of the work while he did the little shit. I didn't even know those were graded like that for a long time.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I find these results very questionable. They're based on an automated assessment tool <a href="http://www.aspiringminds.com/technology/automata">http://www.aspiringminds.com/technology/automata</a>
There are only sparse details on how that works. They also appear to be basing it on &quot;known&quot; good coding techniques, without any listings, and despite the rest of us always arguing about what is good and bad.</p>
<p>While the situation may not be good, this study is completely untrustworthy. It's just a company trying to sell their questionable HR product.</p></div>
