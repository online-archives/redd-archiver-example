    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to the dirty secret of the professional programing world. Doing it fast, with half-assed tools and stupid, every-changing constraints is not a thing that gets in the way of the job, it is the job. </p>
<p>Doing it right, the way that you know is best, is a hobby. </p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, pretty much every job is like this.</p>
<p>Embrace the suck. You got good at doing things right, now get good at doing it fast, with shit tools, and in a way that makes the guy with the cash in his hand happy. Be one of those scrappy dudes that can fix anything with a hairpin and piece of string. That's rewarding in its own way too.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've felt the same till I realised that badly designed websites keep the customers coming back for do-overs which means more money. It also means they listen to me a lot more when I say something a designer has designed may look pretty, but usability wise it's a steaming pile of shit. On average, the customer would roll in to get a 3-5k website done and then spend the same amount (or more) in improvements.</p>
<p>If you want it done right the way you know it should be done, then get people with good UI/UX experience.</p></div>

<p>&quot;Didn't we just finish the back-end overhaul last month?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, well [vendor] pushed an update which borks systems running on X.XX so now we have to do it all over again for the update&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the hell does this update accomplish?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It moves the user settings menu into a sub menu of the system settings. And there's a new logo on the splash page.&quot;</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You want to enjoy it? Pull out an old system where you just had the CPU and some RAM, and program in assembly language (machine is too cruel). There is nothing except you and the hardware, no social/historical baggage (aside from the instruction set) bogging you down. Old game consoles from the 1980s are pretty good for this, and have some graphical output. Newer, the AVR microcontrollers are pretty clean and you can work on the bare metal as well.</p></div>
