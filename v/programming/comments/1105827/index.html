Which seems pretty odd.  
Debugging output is whargarble to me as it's just too specific to what's going on with this code, and google searches for that error seem to be about other servers/services.   
Also, the Submit a new... form won't let you select Text, AND the Create button for Link posts doesn't seem to trigger / "do anything" either.   
Anyone have insight / clue / pointers / experience?   
If it were *just* Java, or *just* front-end / js code, or *just* SQL, I might have a fighting chance... but with all this fucking cassandra, rabbit, memcache stuff that I don't have experience with... whew. I don't know where to look.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Which voat clone are you talking about?</p>
<p>What that error is saying is the page POST_submit has not been programmed yet and is just a placeholder. It sounds like the software you are trying to use is not quite finished or polished. Perhaps look to see if there is a newer version of the software available with the missing functionality added.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It's the code that gets installed when you use the &quot;reddit source&quot; code from Git hub, via the install script. <br />
<a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit">https://github.com/reddit/reddit</a><br />
They have it so automated that you don't even have to &quot;follow instructions&quot; as the script rolls through everything. It installed without error. (That said, I have done some basic troubleshooting and &quot;looking around&quot; and manually reading through the steps and checking things... etc. I haven' t just &quot;run the script and then stopped&quot;)   
</p>
<p>Now, to your point, that doesn't mean there's not something missing / wrong / buggy with what's there, but it just seems... unlikely... that such core functionality is present as just a stub. </p></div>
