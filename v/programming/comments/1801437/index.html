<p>Moreover, there are actual methodologies that build on this idea of perpetual incremental improvement. Agile and lean methodologies require codebases that can manage and deal with change from day one, from the first line of code. That are written for change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They suck at change! Agile has become a mega big industry of certificates where scrum teachers gets rich by promising companies eternal wealth by firing half of their developers and replace the other developers by low wage developers.</p>
<p>There is nothing Agile in Agile development, been in and out of Agile development and the development speed and development quality really sucks. </p>
<p>And the sad thing of all, you create a generation of developers that does not know that all their projects can be done faster, easier and cheaper. being brainwashed that AGILE is the only way, but it is not. It is the stupidest way, based on religious believe that AGILE is the lord and savior!</p></div>

<p>But what exactly are these skills? What does maintainable code exactly mean, that a software developer candidate needs to have expertise in? How can be a codebase’s resistance to change kept low, so that more and more features can be added without interruptions, and more and more developers can be hired to add new features even faster, and less and less full rewrites are needed, every couple of years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding more developers doesn't work, all you do is cripple the team even more. </p>
<p>I heard someone here as example that SCRUM is like climbing a tree and expect that when enough people climb trees that you will get to the Moon.</p>
<p>I also heard on a Youtube discussion that AGILE is like running a marathon by having your team gave 100 meter sprints every 1 week. That team never ends the marathon, they burn out or leave the company.</p>
<p>The only thing AGILE do is giving  the illusion that your team is productive but in reality they are wasting 90% of their productivity time on senseless meetings, planing, and creating spaghetti code that will fail the project.</p>
<p>To give an idea how deep the SCRUM madness gets: Imagine that you have 3 contractor workers that has to wire some building. </p>
<ul>
<li>Contractor A opens the road, puts in the cable and closes the road.  
</li>
<li>Contractor B has to wait until contractor A has closed the road before he can open the road put a cable in and close the road.</li>
<li>Contractor C has to wait until contractor B has closed the road before he can open the road put a cable in and close the road</li>
<li>Contractor A suddenly discovers at the demo that reds are red and it turns out that Contractor C has damaged the wires of Contractor A.</li>
<li>Contractor A has to reopen the road to emergency repair the wiring  and close the road again.</li>
<li>Contractor B now suddenly discovers that Contractors A emergency repairs now sens false sensory data to their wiring system.</li>
<li>Contractor B has to reopen the road, introduce some noise reduction filters and close the road again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the madness of wasting precious time and energy that could have been used for development instead.</p>
<p>One guy could have opened the road, put in all cables, cross checked of the cables are not damaged or interfere each other and only after he tested then he closes the road.</p>
<p>I challenge the companies to do this simple test. Take one good developer, and let him implement the same features as the complete scrum team. But no planning, no meetings, not predefined order no daily meetings, let him ficus on the work and stand back. That one guy replaces your complete SCRUM team and the end result will be better!</p></div>
