    <div class="md"><p>You've gotta have the right upbringing, brain, and interest for it. If you've been brought up in a dull, uncreative, unstimulating environment; are apathetic in life and don't enjoy learning new things; and simply is born with a brain that doesn't remember well, doesn't learn well, i.e. low cognition and memory...then yes, coding will be hard and boring to learn.</p>
<p>But I Iearnt Java and C++ in the early years of high school (Year 8 onwards, or for you american folks, uh, Grade, well I dunno your weird ass system so I was about 12yo), and it was great fun, actually one of the best things I ever chose to do. I was playing minecraft like the dweeb I was, and thought <em>&quot;wouldn't it be cool if I could make things like this and make mods for this!&quot;</em>. So I went to my local library one day in the summer when I was bored, and picked up a book, Java for the Absolute Beginner, and I was hooked.</p>
<p>Now I can code in Java, C++, Python, HTML, etc., and still enjoy it.</p>
<p>Poor journalism on the article's front, writer clearly has no idea what they're talking about.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I know few guys who do C++ professionally and they are very afraid to say that they know C++, always some disclaimers, it's just a very difficult language.</p>
<p>Having HTML in the same sentence as Java, C++ or Python makes me believe that you may overestimate your coding abilities.</p>
<p>Do you code professionally (for money)?</p>
<p>I'm not attacking you personally, I just think that C++ is not something you can teach 12 year olds as you seem to be suggesting.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>So everyone should just omit HTML from the list of their coding skills? Fun fact: Most people who go out of their way to point out how easy HTML is are actually really bad at it. I've seen way too many programmers who think they're too smart make static layouts with tables and use JavaScript everywhere for things that can easily be done with HTML/CSS.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>C++ is easy, it's basically C and C# without the bullshit, and with aliases.</p>
<p>Also, HTML is pretty easy, it's very repetitive, especially the basics. </p>
<p>Also, Python is basically C++ but without a few brackets and some little changes here and there.</p>
<p>Also, I don't code for money. I didn't say I know them through and through professionally. I know them well enough to do some interesting stuff.</p>
<p>I think you overestimated my age to be fair.</p>
<p>Lastly, I <em>did</em> struggle. It took me years. But I enjoyed it and got the basics pretty quickly. Good author, good programming languae :)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>C++ itself is not at all a difficult language (done this for 7 years) . but you need the discipline, to go for quality code and clean up what you allocated. </p>
<p>The reason why I prefer C# over C++ is because the compiler is way faster and there is Resharper that aids C# development. I can build projects way faster in C#.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Well HTML and CSS is a very easy coding language to learn and can help a lot in your everyday dealings on the internet.  Just like 0x5f3759df said it is more on pair with reading and writing in this day and age.  Sometimes I need to download elements from a website for referencing.  Knowing  HTML and CSS makes it so much easier; as I just have  to look through the code to find the location of said  content.  </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I don't see that happening.</p>
<p>I can drive a car. Small trucks. I can refill petrol. But when it breaks, I throw my hands in the air and call someone. I won't be able to build a car either. If I'd ever want to change my car, I'd buy a new one or ask someone to make it work.</p>
<p>I see this similar to programming. <em>Someone</em> needs to be able to do this and it's a valuable skill because most people cannot program or not at the level e.g. to make a smartphone application. Those people can create other things. But it's not a <em>required</em> and basic skill like writing. Like repairing or building cars. Everyone uses cars. Few can repair them. Very can build one.</p>
<p>That being said, I foresee that being able to program even in small amounts helps someone a lot, and with more and more computers everywhere, it's getting better and more useful over time. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is why everyone should have at least some basic training in programming. Not so that everyone can program, but so that those who can't will at least have some understanding of what goes into it, rather than &quot;well I dunno what you do but it can't be that hard.&quot;</p>
<p>I've tutored university-level programming courses and in my experience there's a clear and definite gap between people who can learn to code and people who can't. And it's not just &quot;how smart&quot; they are - many people who can't code are highly intelligent, but nonetheless just aren't able to really 'grok' software.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I whole heartedly agree with this article, though I think education can solve it, just at a much more fun dental level. You see the same problem with real math and science. People don't seem to get the ability to work with complex systems from current education.</p>
<p>From my experience, a critical thinking and logical analysis are the most important parts of being a programmer, or working g with any other complex systems. The ability to break down systems and visualize complex relationships in the systems is a necessary skill. I was lucky enough to be part of a school program that taught me those things at an early age, and I've had great success in programming, math, etc. Without it though, regardless of intelligence, I would have fallen flat on my face. The answer is to incorporate these things into school's curriculums.</p></div>
