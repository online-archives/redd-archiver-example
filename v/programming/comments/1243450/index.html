<p>Offline programs will always be better than online ones. Not to mention a command line interface is always useful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck everything about this article. It's no wonder why programming has turned into the mess it has when it is believed that these things are where the future is. Framework this, pre-processor that, algorithm all over- we've lost sight of how to build anything properly anymore. Just look at all these popular pieces and parts and ask yourself where they will be in 2 to 5 years and that will tell you how insignificant to software engineering they are. I've spent my career honing my skills and growing my knowledge to be a capable software engineer and architect only to have the most recent 5 years completely turn that into chaos. As soon as I use my new &quot;Just-in-time education&quot; about a new hot technology it becomes passé because some new hot thing has just popped up and the technology I was working on integrating is no longer being contributed to. I was far more productive and project successful when I simply built my own libraries and techniques and grew them over time to be what my projects needed. I've grown tired of all the promises that HTML5 + JS + framework du jour + back-end technology stack are supposed to give us but never deliver. HTML5 was supposed to finish off Flash because it could do sooooo much yet we have few examples of anything remotely as good. All the hype these days is to draw money to a select few popular people while the rest of us are supposed to worship them and struggle to manage the cluster fuck they give us as technology. If I didn't have so many years vested in this career I'd just change professions and be done with it all. What a crappy time it is to be a seasoned programmer. Young guys, I don't envy your futures. /rant</p></div>

<p>Hot: Just-in-time education</p>
<p>Not: Four years up front</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see many developers that have a crash course in &quot;Just-in-time education&quot;, their projects all end into failures.</p>
<p>Even seasoned developers can't create good solutions with &quot;Just-in-time education&quot;. That never Works. Good developers already started years before to learn new technologies that may be used in the future. The moment they need it they already solved most of the issues before.</p>
<p>The fact that it is hot does not mean that the project will not end into tears.</p></div>

<p>Hot: GitHub</p>

<p>HR have no clue what to hire and they surely will have no clue what GitHub is. HR wants you to give them some excel spreadsheet that contains the number of years of experience for a certain item. Their choice in hiring you is just based how many bingo words you have written on your resume. </p>
<p>No one is going to look at your code on Github because no one that hires you will have a clue what they are looking at. They don't even understand if your code is good or completely bad. 10x developers will have big fights on Github to get their code committed. These fights are caused because 1x developers have no clue what you are doing. When HR looks at the discussion, they will favor the 1x developers since there are more of them and not hire that 10x developer that would actually make their project a big success.</p></div>
