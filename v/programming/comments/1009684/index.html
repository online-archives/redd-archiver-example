    <div class="md"><p>This individual seems to be rather clueless about the goal of interviews. When they ask you a question, the intention is to ask something that you don't know off the top of your head to try to get a bit of insight into your thought process. A maze solving problem is a perfect example of this. They're not asking you to recite A*, they're asking you to share how you'd go about solving it. So you might start by drawing a simple maze and interpreting your own thoughts into general control flow and then convert that into an algorithm. In fact simply code dumping A* would probably result in the interviewer asking a different question as that response is almost as useless as <em>&quot;I'm not a recent college grad. You expect to have this memorized?!?!?&quot;</em> The fact this individual is seemingly incapable of producing algorithmic thought without having memorized it is most likely the reason they were not getting hired for anything. All the above applies 100% for Google who has the reputation as a tough interviewer. Your credentials get you in the door, they don't get you the job. Your display of skills and logical/creative thinking gets you the job.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with your statement about the goal of deeply technical interviews, the most important point of the article is &quot;why am I doing algorithmic interviews when I'm applying for a front end position?&quot;</p>
<p>While there still might be some merit to testing someone's problem solving skills, front end work tends to involve few to absolutely no algorithmic problems, and is generally very simple, and more about understanding the process and usage of the front end frameworks you use. I think if this guy was interviewing for a position that involves heavy data manipulation and storage, then sure, these are interview questions are quite important. That's generally just not the case with front end dev.</p></div>

He should at least ask (when scheduling an interview) something like &quot;As I'm applying to be a front end dev, how technical or algorithmic is this interview going to be?&quot; It's a perfectly valid question, and at least gives him time to prepare so he's not blindsided.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The complexity of front end work is determined by your level of seniority and what kind of work the company does. I've written entire validation frameworks for the front end. The work ended up being pretty complex. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect front end devs to have some basic algorithm knowledge. A depth first traversal is trivial, you do that kind of thing regularly.</p>
<p>Even so, interviews aren't just a test of knowledge, but of personality. It's about learning - How does this person approach problems they're unfamiliar with? How will they respond when they <em>don't</em> have the answer memorized? I'd rather watch someone struggle to think something through and then finally admit - &quot;I'm not really sure, I think I'm close but I'd have to ask around or do some googling at this point.&quot; Rather than throw their hands up and whine about algorithm questions in front end interviews. No one is going to hire the latter. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I don't know shit about algorithms, but I'm a Lead UIE because I can build shit. When I get contract work sometimes I can tell they're just testing the water and planning to put up an offer in 3 weeks. I've based my entire success on proving I can build complex features without having a C.S. degree whatsoever, hell I was a graphic designer (really just a production artist)  prior to getting into heavy JS programming.</p>
<p>The interview questions for a frontend, if you want someone who can produce, should really be about pre-processors, CSS/JS technical, HTML accessibility, RESPONSIVE experience and practices, maybe some SVG data charts, ask them what their opinion on jshint or semicolons are (frankly they don't result in higher quality UI code, but &quot;feel&quot; like that's the case). </p>
<p>That said <em>if</em> I interviewed at Google I would expect to hear performance questions which could be very difficult to answer (I'd point to Matt Bynens, Nick Zakas, JD Dalton blogs). </p>
<p>As far as inverted binary trees go, I'm sure someone has a job to handle that already.</p>
<p>Many of the big recruiters reach out to me (Amazon, Imgur, Microsoft, Adobe, etc) but I don't bother because I know their interviews aren't for me. Just have me prototype something and you'll probably want me on your team. And yes, it doesn't have to be my niche (Angular on Rails), ask me to prototype something that's not my niche and the result should still be strong. I've worked on a dozen platforms (PHP CMS, proprietary CMS ~x3), .NET CMS, Rails CMS, Phonegap), and delivered every time. You'd think the ability to ship features over multiple years and systems has value...</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If I'm hiring a software dev specifically and solely for the rote UI work then sure. But if I'm not some accounting software company that survives by grunting out yet another quarterly revision of the same mediocre software package, then I want someone who can do more than just the grunt work, I want a team member who can analyze new problems and create new algorithms to solve them. And to test this skill, it's actually <em>better</em> to give them a problem to solve that they don't already know off the top of their head.</p></div>

<p>That's the textbook answer. But you just have to read some of the replies on that article to see that a lot of interviewers don't know this - they expect you to know these kinds of algorithms off the top of your head. </p>
<p>I knew one old-school interviewer that asked every candidate the layers in the OSI model. He told me in all the time he'd been asking, only one person knew the answer. My response to that was &quot;Doesn't that say more about you than the candidates?&quot; </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be the case, but I know for a fact that I what I said applies to one of the companies he listed by name - Google. While there certainly may be some issues with hiring at some places, I think there's also another issue at play here. In computer science there are a large number incredibly skilled individuals since for many the work itself is intrinsically rewarding. This means some otherwise smart and skilled, but not as skilled, individuals are going to end up being second tier candidates. At most companies they'd still be in the upper tier of engineers, but at a company that attracts all the top talent like Google - they're not even going to get hired. And I have 0 doubt that some percent of these people are going to reconcile their failure not as a failure of themselves but as a failure of the hiring system itself - <em>How could they possibly not be hired?!? Clearly the problem must have been in the hiring system itself!</em></p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you're kind of repeating yourself there. I get what you're saying, but what I'm saying is that his big lede example was <em>not</em> this sort of scenario that you're describing.</p>
<p>Inverting a binary tree is a really trivial problem that again shows whether or not somebody is capable of algorithmic thought.  He even mentioned doing it on a whiteboard where he could have easily fleshed out his thought processes even if he couldn't produce the code 'cold'. I don't think I've ever had to invert a binary tree (<em>I actually had to look it up to make sure it was what I assumed it was</em>) and decided to give the problem a quick spin. </p>
<pre><code>void Invert(Tree root)
{
    Dictionary&lt;Tree, Tree&gt; parentLookup = new Dictionary&lt;Tree, Tree&gt;();
    FillDic(root, null, parentLookup);
    foreach (var entry in parentLookup)
    {
        entry.Key.left = entry.Value;
        entry.Key.right = null;
    }
}
void FillDic(Tree root, Tree parent, Dictionary&lt;Tree, Tree&gt; dic)
{
    if (root == null)
        return;
    FillDic(root.left, root, dic);
    FillDic(root.right, root, dic);
    dic.Add(root, parent);
}
</code></pre>
<p>10 lines of code, and it works. The difference here is that in your example you're putting as a prereuisite &quot;anybody who has done significant RDBMS.&quot; The prerequisite for this problem by contrast is being capable of thinking in a logical and algorithmic fashion and having a grasp on the most fundamental computer science datatypes. Furthermore solutions like mine which are not going to be the most pin point optimized give a clear insight into my thought process. <em>&quot;The only complexity in this problem is access to the parents. We need to get the parents in a fashion where we can iterate the nodes and mutate them without screwing up the iteration.&quot;</em> From there it's wham, bam, done.</p></div>

<p>So you <em>didn't</em> know what it was for sure. Also, the amount of programming experience necessary to even guess what &quot;invert a binary tree&quot; means is probably far beyond what <strong>I</strong> am saying when I say &quot;anybody who has done significant RDBMS work&quot;</p>
<p>And here's the thing - I'm going to guess you've never done any data modeling, so my &quot;many-many join&quot; question looks completely alien to you. Does that mean I shouldn't hire you for any job that touches a database? Or should I ask you questions to see if you have the aptitude to grok data design and database interaction and that I can teach you what you need? Note that to do this kind of poking, I'm going to have to get out of RDBMS terminology and try to discover where you are with concepts <em>you</em> know (key-pair sets, hash tables, linked lists, arrays, etc). </p>
<p>And I'll say it again - you went with pseudocode to solve a problem you'd never addressed before. I'm asserting that I know for a fact there are interviewers who would expect you to be completely familiar with the concept and write down the standard book solution, otherwise you get a &quot;No Hire.&quot; Someone who asks you the question and works with you through your lack of familiarity is fine; the issue are the people who think their perspective of the world is the only world and if you can't answer something <strong>they</strong> learned when they were 17, then obviously <strong>you</strong> are an idiot. </p>
<p>To go meta - don't think in terms of how <em>you</em> would treat a candidate in this situation. We're talking about pedantic asshats who don't understand how to interview. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>And I am stating that it's not an &quot;employer&quot; thing, it's a &quot;person&quot; thing, and unless you can tell me that Google has specific training for hiring interviews and has managers periodically audit the interviews of their employees, then yes, <em>it even happens there</em>. Because if you have a thousand people doing hiring interviews, you're gonna have a significant percentage that think it's supposed to be an exam instead of a conversation. </p>
<p>As for the code - my apologies. I didn't even glance at it. &quot;Pseudocode&quot; was not meant to be dismissive - only a lowest-common-denominator of &quot;enough codelike substance to show your thinking in designing the algorithm.&quot; Looking at it now, it's fascinating in that it's theoretically correct, but we both know that in reality you'd have to optimize / rework it because it would freaking explode in memory.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no I didn't take it that way. I think it's great that it looks like pseudo code. I strive for clarity in code so that's definitely a compliment! In any case the algorithm is actually perfectly performant. The entire memory required is N pointers. You could make the traversal nonrecursive if necessary, but that would not an issue in anything except rather extreme circumstances. I think it's a pretty nice implementation!</p>
<p>As for the interview stuff, interviews at Google don't work like at a normal company. It's not like you have your interviewer who then deals with a line of 50 people chopping them off one by one like the headsman at his block. It's a full day affair full of numerous interviews with people in the department you're interested in. The questions are prepared and reused and designed to test the technical creativity of the applicant. The phone interviews are relatively trivial and are just to ensure somebody has a basic degree of competence.</p>
<p>In any case this individual is in no way is describing the scenario you are. He seemed mostly upset that the interviewer only focused on actually doing things instead of talking about things he'd done in the past. And this is by design. Most of these comments are coming from chats with a friend who worked as an interviewer at Google, as many of their engineers do. One night we had a conversation about why I'm working solo since my technical interests align pretty much perfectly with Google's pursuits. My complaint was pretty similar to yours and that I felt the entire hiring process was a charade that I didn't feel like participating in. It turns out that Google's entire hiring process, and the reason they arguably end up with more top talent than any other company, is because they've specifically developed a system to counter this charade. Occam's razor here is stating pretty clearly that this guy probably just not a particularly sharp coder.</p></div>

<p>After about 10 minutes we jump right into whiteboard problems — implement a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The thing is, it takes less than three seconds with Google to find a perfect implementation of a breadth-first search algorithm, and if you actually wanted to implement one in production, no programmer in their right mind would write a solution to a known problem blind instead of using code that's already been tested a few trillion times.  If the test is to discover the thought process I would follow on the job if I knew I needed to implement a breadth-first algorithm from scratch, my thoughts are that I would use Google.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be better to ask what the advantages and disadvantages are over other means of tree traversal, or whether I have ever used it before, which I actually have, in a chess AI, whose code they can look at if they want...  To see if I actually know why and when I would use it is more important than the details of how one is implemented, when that is public information that is trivial to look up, I would think.  Good judgement and understanding is not.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've done tree traversal for a flat array of nodes with only <code>parent_id</code> references as the main association across thousands of objects. This was based on the linux inode pattern. </p>
<p>My first draft of building the tree was shit, 10s of thousands of computations. My boss showed me that a dictionary (or literally a JS data object that saved some IDs) would solve almost all of that performance. We ended up looping the nodes twice, which took the feature from factorial complexity (something like N^n, to 2N, and I don't know big-O notation at all).</p>
<p>So I have respect for that skill, but as a standard frontend dev it's mostly irrelevant. Such a frontend dev will be already employed at a major performance shop. e.g. Google.</p></div>

<p>While I agree with the sentiment (was rejected several times a few months ago), knowing basic algorithms is rather important. I would assume most competent programmers can write BFS on the spot.

You need to look through an object tree for something, you're generally going to end up either going breadth first or depth first. This isn't something you do <em>every</em> day but I'd say I do it once a month.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It is. Logically, as the biggest names in tech are mostly on the west coast. That's a sweeping statement, of course there are big companies to the east, but they're not as hungry for C.S. geniuses, they want production. I gotta think 95% of frontend producers out there, with legitimately valued jobs, can't pass C.S. questions @ Google/BigName.</p></div>

<p>The second round was a 2-on-1 interview with a whiteboard problem. I was asked to write a function findSum(array1, array2, sum) that returns true if two numbers from two sorted arrays add up to a given sum. I was able to solve it with my eyes closed using a double for loop — O(n²) time complexity. For the remaining time I was able to reduce the time complexity by converting arrays to hash maps, then finding the difference by subtracting sum from the first list element and checking if that difference is a “key” of the second hash map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is illustrative of this guy's lack of interest in problem-solving.  Any interview question that I struggle with on the spot, I will spend time puzzling over after the interview until I get it.  It's natural CS instinct and also good for future interviewing.  (Although I agree that CS interviewing is pretty fucked up, and hate having to do it)  I would also probably make sure to have it solved before writing about it in a blog post.</p>
<p>Given x1...xn in array1 and y1...ym in array2.  Let i=1 and j=m.  While i&lt;=n and j&gt;=1: if xi+yj == sum, return true.  Else if xi+yj &lt; sum, i++.  Else, j--.  End-while.  Return false.</p>
<p>Pretty sure this is correct and would write out a proof if I had more time or wasn't on my phone.</p>
<p>This solution seems intuitive to me, and is even hinted at by the arrays being pre-sorted, which he apparently didn't try to make use of.</p></div>
