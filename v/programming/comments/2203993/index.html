    <div class="md"><p>I think this video is off the mark in many ways, primarily by assuming development is only happening in companies like FB and other tech related businesses. I have been in the game for a long time and have done very well in non-tech companies who have internal development needs. While most of my knowledge is outdated due to the march of technological advances, I keep relevant by choosing which technologies to learn and by having good project management skills as well. I don't jump on fads like most jr level upstarts and I don't waste time on new and unproven languages that will be dead in a few years. I focus on strong and maintainable code that meets the business' needs. I usually get exclusive development of special projects that need quick turnaround since the other greener developers would take three times as long and with 100 times more errors. We over 35 years old developers who don't transition to management (by choice in my case) get where we do by being highly capable and we can keep going as long as there are jr level fuck ups making sure we will have jobs by making crappy code. Plus I get the advantage in that I have the technical say in which young upstart gets hired when a opening comes up. Try to pull some young developers are better bullshit with me and you'll be sent back to the job search. Being a senior programmer has its privileges.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you about jobs outside the FB type companies and outside the tech industry.</p>
<p>When it comes to the tech industry, especially the top companies, I wish I were wrong, but this is what I see: It's up or out. Top companies will pay someone in their mid-20s more to be a programmer than most people will ever see in their lives. They will not hire someone in their mid-30s for these positions. They will pay someone in their mid-30s even more to do higher level work, but you have to reach that level in your 20s or you are out. Laid off at the next recession, not able to get your next job, &quot;managed out,&quot; whatever. At that point you can go from a higher tier company to a lower tier one, for instance, from Google to eBay, maybe become a manager or consultant, start your own business, or leave the industry.</p></div>
