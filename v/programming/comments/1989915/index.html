<p>That said I know the community is festooned with SJWs/radfems/marxists/identitarians, they use the CoC (<a href="http://citizencodeofconduct.org/">CoC Cancer</a> --- don't click the link, save your sanity, it's too late for me but not for you) which promotes creating friendlier and more welcoming communities, fair enough yeah? But the fact that's it's used, first and foremost as a vehicle to force identitarianism into the tech and open source community is what I have a problem with. You can't just be a coder/programmer/developer/whatever... you have to be a BLACK coder, a QUEER programmer, a TRANS developer... and that is the most important facet of your contribution, that you're black, queer, trans, whatever :/ They also use the Node.JS Policy on Trolling (<a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling">Node.JS Cancer</a> --- just read item #1 and then run).</p>
<p>I think I'm going to push forward with learning Rust, technically it look's sound (so far) and I have no issues with it, I don't plan on engaging with the <em>official</em> Rust community and if I need to there's plenty of sane places to engage with others (like right here, hey everyone!).</p>
<p>Just interested in your thoughts on Rust, it's community, SJWism being forced into tech/open source and so on...</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Most communities around newer programming languages are shit.  There's the obvious SJW infection but I see a few other problems on occasion.</p>
<p>For Rust in particular whenever a significant bug appears in some old C program/library there's always some Rust people saying &quot;you should rewrite in Rust&quot;.  Fucking annoying and do it yourself if it is such a simple task.  Honestly these people drive me insane.  I will even get myself banned for insulting them.</p>
<p>Then some of these languages want to use their own package manager and repositories rather than what I have on the system, namely pacman.  Perl (not exactly new) has CPAN, Python (also not new) has pip, Ruby has &quot;gems&quot;, and I am sure Rust will get its own segregated shithole.  The ones used for &quot;web apps&quot; are the most annoying because those retard devs have no idea how to do anything other than hardcode a dependency with a specific version.  Fuckers!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is I'm like a fucking magpie, I like the new and shiny shit :P</p>
<p>Couldn't agree more, dunno what you'd call it? &quot;technology preaching&quot;, maybe? And if it is such a big fucking issue why don't they code the same program or library in Rust themselves? Don't expect everyone else to change just to make you happy.</p>
<p>I do get your beef with the individual package managers, different commands and shit, Rust sort of has this for library dependencies but once the programs compiled it's done, it's not too bad, you can do it manually so it's not a huge deal. That's said I'm still just starting out in Rust so there may be surprises later :/</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>My computer language of choice, a newer one, is filled with faggots. I don't mean queers, because I don't mind queers, I mean faggots. I don't think I've met one that I didn't want to punch where their man parts should be. SJW, cucked, pussies. I swear I stole their lunch money when we were kids. I still use, and like, the language, I just don't deal with the &quot;community.&quot;</p>
<p>TL; DR - If you like the language, ignore the faggots.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, what BS. Even back in the 90s, anything with a gendered pronoun in a positive context had to be female. Science and maths textbooks used exclusively female pronouns... 'the scientist notices <em>her</em> experiment does X', '<em>she</em> inverts the matrix' etc. And still, any time anything ever uses male pronouns we have to change them to female pronouns &quot;for equal representation.&quot; So fucking sick of it.</p></div>

<p>EDIT - why would there be an SJW problem in a coding community? It's totally divorced from SJW issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'd think so, but no, not since various SJW trolls decided to use their bullshit as a platform for seizing control of online communities. Example: <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12004">The attempt to take over Ruby with the 'Contributor Covenant'.</a>.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Srazash, can you keep in touch with me as you learn? When I first came across Rust, I was like this has the potential to be one of the best programming languages invented and I study several languages. I haven't had any issues with the community aside from not giving good tutorials. The tutorials are almost close to the worst I've ever came across. I guess these people who know Rust well want to keep the knowledge all to themselves... good luck with that. That is how languages die. Python and R became top dogs. They also have some of the greatest tutorials and communities ever. Remember, it's not what is said but it's how something or someone makes you feel. I really want to keep Rust in my selective list of languages to study, but the lack of good tutorials make it hard.</p></div>
