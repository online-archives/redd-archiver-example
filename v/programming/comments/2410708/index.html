    <div class="md"><p>I think it's a bit of the reverse...  I'm very fond of the Python programming language, but in a lot of ways I don't think it's ideal as a first programming language.  He goes into how every computer used to start up in an IDE, however primitive, and now it's too much for the speshul snowflakes to install a language, but he misses that the language that IDE used was BASIC.  And despite a number of reasons real coders don't like BASIC, especially the old-fashined BASIC where every line of code has a line number, I think it's a much better language to learn in.</p>
<p>I've helped teach a few people, programming, and the one thing a number of novices find surprisingly hard to get is how a program is stepped through linearly.  How a computer is, in one sense, a complicated clock that ticks through its instructions.  Isolating blocks of code as functions is very nice but it can derail that concept and leave students struggling to understand how the processing is ordered.</p>
<p>Gonna leave this here, there are a number of other reasons I think BASIC has an advantage, and other reasons why BASIC could be better, but I don't really feel like writing a dissertation.  :-P</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the article is retarded.</p>
<p>It's extremely easy to get started programming nowadays.</p>
<p>Especially compared to when you had to write code by hand and then get it stamped and all.</p>
<p>Sure, you can't inject code straight from the OS boot screen.</p>
<p>But any &quot;programmer&quot; who complains about downloading an IDE being to complicated is not with a dime. How lazy.</p>
<p>And often times as with Python you don't even /need/ one, you can just use note pad.</p></div>

<p>I am very sympathetic to these reactions.  And in one sense, their frustration is completely justified:  it should not be as hard as it is to download a program and run it.</p>

<p>I am the opposite of sympathetic to these reactions.  If you can't download a fucking program and set a system variable you have no business programming.  Go be a salesman or suck cocks for a living, anything that is fit to your level of mental development and ability.</p>
<p>I am so tired of marginal (to sub-marginal) shit stains cluttering up my profession.  People like this, who want to learn programming because it pays well, and who do a quarter-ass job learning it, then shit up every office and development team I've seen in the last 15 years.  It's like a plumber who barely knows how to lay pipe.</p></div>

It just kills me knowing that people like this can land the job, and then are difficult to get rid of (because of the overly PC HR policies) when they don't understand the basics, and/or are not willing to put in the work to learn how to do these things themselves.</p></div>

<p>And some people don't have the gene necessary to be a successful programmer. It's one of those occupation with a minimum IQ requirement, you can't have &lt;90 IQ and be a good programmer. The thing is that some races have average IQ on that range or even lower so....</p>

Many of them requiring reading a book to fully understand.. and if you're using third party software to save time I have to question what is really bring saved</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In my age the difficulty of learning programming was due to the idiosyncrazies of the programming language itself, say, Turbo Pascal. Today Python is just too easy. I agree with you that <em>something</em> should be hard because we need to filter for IQ, because low IQ people even when they can program on a basic level will ultimately fail when they have to design a larger application.</p>
<p>And what the fuck is hard even in downloading and installing Komodo ActivePython then either just using their editor or one of the gazillion Python IDEs.   And in this case Linux is even easier, they don't have have to learn the magic scary command line (lol), there are graphical package managers, search for python, click on something that looks like a python distro, click on install, same for some good editor, done. It is so easy it is not even a good IQ filter. It is about as hard as installing Skyrim or Fallout 4 mods. So all it proves the future programmer has at least as much technical aptitude as any random faggot capable of installing the prerequisite for Loverslab mods because they want to fap at dickgirl orcs in Skyrim. Not a very high obstacle to jump.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I with you. I used to teach intro to programming at the university level. If you don't understand the fundamentals of how the computer works, chances are, you're going to be a pretty shitty programmer. This is a barrier, sure, but I think of it more as a gateway, a filter if you will. We need better programs/programmers, and we won't get it by lowering the bar.</p></div>

<p>Most of the how-tos on how to setup an working environment absolutely suck donkey balls. One thing that isn't <em>exactly</em> the same as the writeup and you get lost in hours of troubleshooting.  
</p>
<p>After doing this for a few years now it is fairly easy to do, and fixing the install/setup crap usually takes less than an hour.  But when you have 30-50 hours of homework each week wasting time on shitty setup procedures is a pain.</p></div>

<p>I remember typing code from a magazine into a green+black screen to make a game.  I just never followed up on it until now.  Currently learning binary commands to RISC-V machine code into assembly and translating to C. Boring stuff, but weirdly interesting to see how code makes the physical interface into actual logic gates and such.</p></div>

<p>Some of them send me email.  They often express frustration, because they are trying to learn Python, or Bayesian Statistics, or Digital Signal Processing.  They are not interested in installing software, cloning repositories, or setting the Python search path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned to code in the 90s, so my opinion will be colored by that, but i don't see this as a bigger problem than what we had back then.</p>
<p>The install processes have gotten a lot smoother over the years, and you have more languages to pick from with varying difficulty. Want to do PHP? You don't have to set up the trifecta of php, db and apache manually, just download XAMPP and boom, it's done. C#? Visual Studio educational edition is free to download for everyone and works out of the box. Want to have a shot at creating games? Unity. Don't want to install anything? Plenty of JS environments online you can use to execute your code. Want just the basics? You can try those in bash/powershell. Need something more complex? GCC is default in damn near every linux distro. In a lot of instances the complex setup of the environment was reduced to running one file that bootstraps it for you, or even just booting a live cd that has everything you need.</p>
<p>In addition to that new coders these days have access to much more resources, from articles to video tutorials to actual source code. Not to mention lowering of one barrier that seems to be omitted - the admission fee in form of buying a computer. You can get a laptop for 200 bucks, even cheaper if used. Sure it'll be a piece of shit, but perfectly capable of running basic programs.</p>
<p>I always took setting up the environment to be very much a part of programming. I also always found it to be the easiest part. The &quot;i can't learn how to code because i can't set up the environment&quot; seems like nothing but a convenient excuse. </p>
<p>It's true that programming in general has gotten more complex. More languages, more libraries, more everything. But you don't need any of that to learn basic concepts. If anything i see the barrier of entry being a lot lower, not higher.</p></div>

<p>Want to have a shot at creating games? Unity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either I am too old and not kept up, or you are wrong in this, dunno. But AFAIK the truly hard and time consuming part of making a game is making the 3D objects and textures in 3D Studio or Blender. Not the programming. I mean if they start with Unity, without making that 3D or even 2D stuff that will be actually visible on the screen, what will their game consist of? Maybe I am wrong, maybe Unity has some built in stuff already...</p>
<p>This is what keeps me out from game dev. I can program all right and have some good ideas. But no way in hell could I draw and texture a 3D human or say weapons in 3D Studio or Blender without it looking like a retarded ass kindergarten homework. I am no visual artist at all, not by long shot. I can't even handwrite without it looking like something straight out of the autist tard ward.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess i should have said &quot;learn to program games&quot;. Unity runs an <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/">asset store</a>, with a lot of prefabs available for free, so you can grab those and focus on the code.</p>
<p>Obviously in order to make a shippable game you'd have to create your own everything to have a shot at it being any good, but if you want to learn how to mess around with physics, object interaction, camera work etc., you can focus on learning that without any modeling knowledge if you use some of the free assets.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I can express the idea here, that there is a malevolent corporate conspiracy behind this, without immediately being viewed as schizophrenic.  That's one of the things I appreciate about Voat.</p>
<p>In my observation, the single biggest problem with the programming industry, is the coercive dominance of object oriented programming as a paradigm, and the desire which many OOP programmers seem to have, to ensure that OOP is the only form that anyone ever uses or learns.  I view OOP as a maladaptive, tyrannical perversion that makes everything associated with programming more complex and difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p>If mobile phone interfaces have taught me anything, it is that the technology industry views its' customers as the enemy, and it does not want users to have understanding or control of the systems they use, because if users had said control or understanding, they might be able to use their systems in ways which were more conducive to their real needs, and less compatible with the rules of Capitalism.  OOP is the perfect coding paradigm for an industry that wants programming to be elitist, and for the majority to be locked out.</p>
<p>Programming has had the same measures taken against it as agriculture.  Operating systems being neither open source or having development environments by default, are directly analogous with Monsanto's introduction of Terminator seeds, which do not allow plants to reproduce after the first generation.  This has also been done for the same reasons.  Money is made via scarcity and monopoly, not via the presence of abundance.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this, most comments here assume a level of expertise that someone who is literally just starting to learn how to program can't have. Maybe it's a 14 year-old who grew up with GUIs and Smartphones, but is legitimately interested in writing software. Rather than diving right into it learning about datatypes and control flows, he has to undergo a potentially painful process of installing all kinds of software on his machine, learn the basics of git and sift through a garbagepile of unfamiliar buzzwords to find the answers and guidelines he needs.</p></div>
