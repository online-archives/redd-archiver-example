    <div class="md"><p>The biggest problem I have with coding test is not that I would have to do it. But there is no reciprocity.</p>
<p>They won't tell you anything about the job until you take the test.</p>
<p>I take the test pass it and find out that it is 20k below what I am making. </p>
<p>Then they are dumb enough to ask you, &quot;Why do you want to work here?&quot;. If that isn't the dumbest question, I dont know what is. You're going through the interview process to decide why you want to work there. But many hirers have this attitude of here's our website, now we want people who are excited to work for us.</p>
<p>I've had more bad experience in doing coding tests, than positive. So I don't waste my time if they aren't willing to reciprocate. If they spend like 20-30 mins answering your questions, about the job, team culture, I have no problem doing the extra work. </p>
<p>Now if I get an email saying they are excited about my resume, but won't spend any time to explain, these things, I just delete it.</p>
<p>Whats worse is for even if you do the coding test, there is no dialogue. Like why did you do this vs doing that. If it doesn't conform to some eggheads way of programming, you don't even get an email back saying someone else was selected.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. But my experience is that people who want you to take coding tests are the equivalent of the robot phone calls. Its so automated there's no personal aspect to the hiring process. </p>
<p>I understand hiring new people is a very difficult and time consuming thing cause you can do coding tests and still get bad hires. </p>
<p>Bottom line though, I want to speak to a real person who can answer questions vs the HR person who doesn't know anything who gives you the coding test and then process you to the next step. </p>
<p>If I'm happy with the interview process and I feel I have a genuine interest in the company and the salary is within my range, I have no problems doing coding tests or coding projects. </p>
<p>I've literally had people tell me that salary, questions will be answered once I satisfy my end with the coding test.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a portfolio that shows your ability to develop stuff that works and a potential employer asks you to take some stupid coding test, I only recommend doing it if you need the money.  Then get the fuck out of there as fast as possible after finding an employer who looks at your portfolio and says &quot;this one looks like a good prospect, they make stuff that works.&quot;  
</p>
<p>Those coding tests have about as much to do with being a developer as the FE and PE exams have to do with real engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A portfolio isn't sufficient. I don't have time to figure out if you actually wrote the code in your portfolio. Even if I've narrowed down the applicant pool to five, I'm not going to go through all of your repos and start googling snippets to see if you just pulled half of this thing from someone else. So, no, a portfolio of any kind doesn't prove you can code. It's certainly nice to see because it gives me things I can ask you about during the interview, but it's not proof.</p>
<p>Having said that, I <em>have</em> found that presenting people with a complex snippet and asking them what it does is just as effective as any code test. It takes <em>much</em> less time, there's a lot less pressure because they aren't coding in front of you, and honestly, we all spend a lot more time reading code than writing it. It also gives them a chance to talk about anything they would do differently to improve the code.</p></div>

<p>I always wondered if there is a coding job where you take existing code to make it do what you want. I'm not a programmer, but I've created programs from existing snippets and modified as required. Performing selects, updates, deletes on data is simple, especially since there is a shit ton of existing code that already does it. Just need to modify it to match what's needed.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Real programmers do not like those people. I have seen code like this and it is absolutely abysmal. They don't know enough in the first place to know what's worth copying so they just copy whatever appears to work based on some blog post. Then you inevitably get in there to fix it and can't understand why on earth they would be doing it that way. Then you realize, this code looks nothing like their other code. You slap a snippet into google and... there's your answer. They just cut &amp; paste garbage from someplace without even understanding its purpose. Amazingly horrible code. If you do this, your coworkers will despise you.</p>
<p>Grabbing snippets to run a SQL query != mashing together snippets to create production code.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can't be transparent to your boss about your copy pasting, then that is a red flag.</p>
<p>Also, if all you know how to do is wire existing shit together, you won't be able to succeed in a programming job.</p>
<p>It's still a skill though and makes you more valuable than your average person who can't do anything with a computer outside of MS office.  But this isn't usually its own position.  Usually you would still need domain credentials in some field, get an &quot;analyst&quot; position or something like that, and then just use the computer skills to push your productivity to the next level.  There are lots of non-programmerd who have the skills you do and it sounds like you'd fall into that crop.  It's not a bad place to be but it'd be hard to get a legit programming gig.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That's the thing though- if you have someone who comes in claiming to be an experienced coder, you don't need to be so condescending as to make them write a code snippet.  It should be apparent just from talking to them.  Ask them for a story about a time when they were challenged by a low-level programming situation on a past job.  If they start talking about how a concurrency bug was introduced by the fact that an assignment to a 32-bit variable marked as 'volatile' was not properly ensured to be an atomic operation by the proprietary compiler for the 16-bit architecture they were working on, you'll have a pretty good idea they can code.  Then you can ask them more questions about what the software did and what the implementation looked like and so on.  How hard is it for a programmer to recognize another programmer in conversation?  Trivial.</p>
<p>The only reason coding questions are needed is at a shithole like amazon where they have such high turnover that they don't even know what percentage of their current devs are capable of programming.  They have to institute such policies because nobody plans on working there longer than a couple years and so they don't give two fucks about the capabilities of the candidate.</p></div>

<p>I am a <em>terrible</em> test taker but an <em>amazing</em> interviewee. Hell if you ask me to do FizzBuzz I'll probably so fuck it and leave (because I'd look like an idiot) but if you ask where a race condition is in a bit of code I could pick it out easily. I'm the guy that you can give a simple problem and say &quot;explain how you got there&quot; and I have a deer in headlights look. Give me a complex problem and I'm all yours.</p>
<p>Every job I've ever gotten was because I knew someone. Only two had a &quot;test&quot; that the blog refers to. One of which, to this day, I'm still the highest test taker on it. The other.. I did shit on and still landed the job. And now we've brought back my .NET 1.1 memories that I thought I drank away... fuck me.</p>
<p>edit: removed some stuff because I'd rather not be head hunted.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You're sounding really really pretentious here, and unfortunately this way of thinking is also real common among people who lack skills, so watch out.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Weed out the non-coders from the ones that do</p>
<p>We assume you can code already otherwise the recruiter/headhunter/HR would not have contacted us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only get the developers that are interested enough to perform their test in a ordered and timely manner.</p>
<p>I assure you that most developers I interview have yet to ever raise a concern about being tested, regardless of what point they are in their careers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather insight about my proficiency for their position</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of times it is more about your problem solving skills and creativity, than whether or not you actually finished the problem. </p>
<ol>
<li>I know how to code, and can show it. They can check my blog, my numerous repositories on GitHub, my public sample projects, my freelancing portfolio, and even my fully-working apps and sites out there. </li>
</ol>
<p>You seem to think a hiring manager has enough time to review all of your stuff. We don't have that much time for you, we're already over worked as it is. Also, I don't know what stuff in your repository is all yours or collaborative or something else altogether. </p>
<ol>
<li>I've already expressed interest in their position. I have a day job, and several side projects: I won't spend a sizable chunk of my free time so they can tick some boxes about my coding skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately the reality is that there are a million guys from India who will.
Take into account that the big companies will get most of those first. Mid sized companies get a few. Tiny companies usually get none. Hence, smaller companies will be easier to start at. </p>
<ol>
<li>No matter how general or specific their tests is, it will never replace the proper way to see if someone fits your position: work with them on the real job, and see how it feels.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing can really do this reliably except for interning, and that is a ridiculous time investment. I want to see if you can solve problems and use your brain, period.</p>
<p>As for your alternatives.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bring the candidate to the office for a day, and work together. They'll get to know the company and its environment, and the company can see how the candidate fits within their team and culture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Intern for a day? 1 day is hardly enough to learn a stack if it isn't exactly what you already do. However, as it is it would be more valuable than a non technical interview. Some could say you'd also be lowering the performance of the rest of the team through distraction, but overall I think this is viable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pair program with people from your team for an hour or two (Screenhero works great), so the candidate can learn from them as they learn from him/her.</li>
</ol>
<p>Same problem as above, also potential confidentiality problems in some cases.</p>
<ol>
<li>Assign the candidate a real feature/bugfix to implement from home, remunerated accordingly. Make them sign an NDA, and both parties will have come out benefitted from the exchange. </li>
</ol>
<p>This again can work for small companies/teams, but if you're work is unacceptable then we've wasted that money and that time as well as legal's time, so for large companies this just wouldn't happen.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you, not sure why you're getting downvoats. This attitude would seem nearly identical to the one of someone who can't code. </p>
<p>This is like when people get back their tests and get angry because it doesn't <em>really</em> represent their mastery of a subject. They say: &quot;Of course I can do the work! Look at my homeworks, projects, and open note quizzes! I obviously understand the material!&quot;. They are just <em>bad test takers</em> they'll say - which is imo way too common of an excuse. </p>
<p>Almost anyone could eventually figure out the test a company gives you if you were free to use the Internet and look at code repositories...</p>
<p>Personally tests are learning opportunity for me. Either I know the answer and can strengthen my knowledge while applying the solution, or I don't know the solution and I must learn a new way to do something. Even when failing tests, make it a point to never fail that material again</p></div>

<p>I would simply add that just as important as your ability to code / do your job is you ability to get along, stfu, and execute a simple task without it turning into a UN debate. Too many know nothings come along and start telling everyone how things need to be and throwing around words like &quot;wrong&quot; with zero knowledge of how an organization got to where it is and why. Many decisions are cost based based and, <a href="#s" title="you're just an asset.">real life spoiler,</a></p>
<p>The way to improve an organization is to master their model and gain reputation, eventually people will want to listen to you, then you can improve things.  </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You're working on a lot of misconceptions here. Firstly, HR types don't know shit about coding. If the test is out of a book or online and the HR people are looking up in a book to find out what the answer is, then that is a warning sign right there. If you're doing the test during the interview, then it is part of the technical interview. It likely came from someone on the development team or the person giving the interview. This is a chance for you to show off and not for an HR type to waste time and money being clever. Mind that you can also use this as an opportunity to size up the interviewer's skills, as you will likely be working for or with that person. </p></div>
