    <div class="md"><p>Most importantly, how are your math skills? If you want to work in advanced algorithms, be prepared to use that calc 4, advanced set theory, linear algebra, and all the other things for which you weren't sure you'd find a use. </p>
<p>As for your question, it really depends on what you want to do. If you just want to do basic machine learning, it's fairly easy to pick up <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> or <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-Learn</a> and start entering <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> competitions. If you want to work on the cutting edge of machine learning and artificial intelligence, you typically need significant contributions to the field, an advanced degree, or (preferably) both. Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS program at Georgia Tech</a> is pretty cheap (~$6k - $7k total) and is surprisingly rigorous.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, stats! They're extremely important for machine learning and AI as well. I erroneously omitted states because it's on the easier end of the math difficulty scale and was more obviously useful (kind of like algebra), somewhat contrary to the list provided in my previous comment. Stats generally provide a base that's used as part of more complex calculations like in Kalman/Particle Filtering, error/confidence computation, randomized optimization, and Bayesian learning. I'd also like to add that ML/AI is not just difficult..it's awesome. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Undergrads can work summer internships with the advanced robotics/machine learning/big data research groups on campus. If you are willing to do the work, the readings, and most importantly the time, you can compete in competitions, or build hobbyist projects. Most applied AI is found within games, and an undergrad degree + skill/completed projects will get you further then a masters + no experience outside academia. Hell, with enough experience in security, you might be one to write white papers <a href="https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-21/dc-21-presentations/Pinto/DEFCON-21-Pinto-Defending-Networks-Machine-Learning-WP-Updated.pdf">like this one</a>. 0x00 is right on the money with their advice. </p>
<p>That all being said, if you want to work with the more abstract, theoretical algorithms, and resources, there is a reason why grad school is a major option. There are more labs, other students/researchers/profs that are all part of the support network, as well as a strong competitive undercurrent that keeps everyone looking up to date on the most recent papers, and tech, to make an impression, first or sustained, in the field. </p></div>
