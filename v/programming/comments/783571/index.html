I am part of a game in  v/modernpowers,  people can claim countries and run them like a govt. The claims process is very time consuming for the moderators because it involves many steps, I had an idea that go something like this:</p>
<p>~~~
User submits claim form
           |
form goes into database
           |                     moderator logs in
           |                              |
                          |
     mod reads over claims and accepts or declines them
           |                              |
        accepted                       declined
           |                              |
something puts data (username and         emails other mods or sends message       
country into a public spreadsheet           to mod IRC chan notifying them
~~~
Now, this is probably really complicated because it involves so many different steps to work out (there was more but I removed dynamically exiting a hot-linked map image and a few others).</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>P.S.: my programming experience is pretty much just python, HTML and CSS.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm a big fan of node.js and it does allow you to do some real time stuff where polling would be needed otherwise but in this case each event is &quot;human&quot; caused so you just have to run the appropriate code to get the right consequences in each interaction.  Any language can do that.</p>
<p>I bet using node would make interacting with that IRC really easy though.</p>
<p>The backend to whatever web form the mod views will just need to support spreadsheets and IRC.</p>
<p>I suggest researching the hard parts first and making some quick prototypes of those interactions.  This will make your code cleaner when you put it all together because you won't be doing guess work at any point.  This will also help you pinpoint if you will be using node or python.  First test if you can use python to enter into a spreadsheet, like if you personally can, and then do the same with IRC.  If you run into a snag with python try it in node or php.  Then you know what language to use to accept the form.</p>
<p>Can you use csv for the spreadsheet because you could get away with some real ducttape code if you can't find a good module to work with?</p>
<p>If you find that different languages are needed for different parts or you would like the web facing code to all be the same process so you don't need a reverse proxy then you can also encapsulate any code into a command line executable and then you can mix and match languages.  That's not preferable but if you find yourself in a bind willingness to do that guarantees the project will get done one way or another.</p></div>
