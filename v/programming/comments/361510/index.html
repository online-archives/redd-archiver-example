    <div class="md"><p>I think it happens to almost every developer at one point. One thing that I've found to be of some help is to listen to <a href="https://unicornfree.com/">Amy Hoy</a> advice on bootstrapping a project. Not that you have to launch products, but a lot of her free newsletters contained an idea or two that really hit home with me.</p>
<p>Some of her advice that may help you is to take one of your unfinished projects and look at it from the beginning. Who is the target audience, what purpose will it serve for them, and what is the minimum you need to deliver? If you can't do everything already for what the minimum requires, list everything that is a requirement and review them to see if it is really necessary and if it is, what exactly are the steps needed to accomplish it. As this process goes on, you'll have a good plan of what you need to do and what you need to learn. Keep breaking down what you need to learn and work on that one small piece at a time. Build on little wins and progress.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried the Go programming language? It's really easy to learn, a joy to program, fast, safe unless you explicitly want to be unsafe, and it has great concurrency natives built in. With how quickly you can learn it and get going, maybe you'll still have steam left over to finish your advanced projects.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I just re-read your post. On second thought if your problem is not knowing how to start your advanced ideas, have you tried Python? It's a great prototyping language at the price of being a bit less manageable once your code base becomes really large. But once you code base is really large, you'll know how to program your big ideas, so you'll be able to migrate to Go to make your program better in most every way.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Please don't downvoat me for recommending one language over others. Python and other languages are great languages; I just personally like Go the best.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop picking up new languages when you don't even know what you're doing in the ones you already tried. Pick one out of the bunch and focus on it for a while. Read a couple books, lurk in blogs and social media posts by senior developers working in that language. You're sabotaging yourself. Computer languages basically do the same thing when it comes right down to it. The basic principles don't change. The only thing that changes are the abstractions.</p>
<p>Maybe you should worry about improving your skills instead of finishing projects. You can't just hop from language to language hoping it will somehow come to you easy on that next try. It's going to be tough. It's going to make you feel stupid. You're going to get stuck, the problem will seem completely hopeless. Then you analyze your approach, refactor a bit, look at it from a few more angles and somehow you manage to make it work. It feels great, you jump around for joy and get back to it only to figure out there's a serious flaw in your implementation. So now you have to figure that out, eventually fixing that too. It gets easier when you get used to working past roadblocks, you get better at it.</p></div>
