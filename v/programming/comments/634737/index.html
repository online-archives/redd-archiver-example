We're probably going to do Hour of Code with some younger kids, which is fine, since you can teach it without being that great at programming. Other than that, though, I can't think of anything within our reach. Some people wanted to try to develop an app, but with only Java and no experience, the learning curve is probably too steep for most people. I'd love to just talk about floating-point representation with people, but it would be better if we had something to show for our work at the end. Do any of you skillful, handsome, dashing programmers know something we could work on?</p></div>
