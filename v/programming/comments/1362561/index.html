I would like to do a kickstarter primarily to fund the development but also to fund recruitment of someone who could actually get the system sold to various state entities.</p>
<p>My experience with coding goes back to PERL, but I am comfortable now with PHP and Python web development and pretty good with SQL. I am slow with interfaces, however my design is very well fleshed out.</p>
<p>Please contact me on here with your qualifications and we'll talk.</p>
<p>Edit: It will be open-source, and I am considering &quot;Ethereum&quot; as the blockchain to use. The corporation will be like a company that does a certified Linux-Distribution.</p></div>
