    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>By restricting the discussion Of this proposal to 1:1 conversations between myself and members of the Community, I hope to better hear everyone’s specific concerns without generating unnecessary noise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An explicit goal of this proposal is to promote cultural diversity within our community and make it more welcoming and inclusive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who cares?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diversity is critical to the project; for Go to become a success, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds. (See Go, Open Source, Community.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh, no it doesn't. Not really. What it needs is competent people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I knew that would be in there somewhere.</p>
<p>You know, all this stuff is a good idea:</p>
<p>Be friendly and welcoming
Be patient
Remember that people have varying communication styles, and that not everyone speaks English fluently.
Be respectful
In particular, respect differences of opinion.
Be charitable
Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
When we do disagree, try to understand why.</p>
<p>But you know it's a foil for suppression of free speech and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Go was created by Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, wasn't it? Why can't they be dictators of the project? Instead we have this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reporting issues</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct Working Group are a group of people that represent the Go community. They are responsible for handling code-related issues. They are:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a committee of people who'll decide if what you said was inappropriate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you encounter a Code of Conduct-related issue, you should report it to the Code of Conduct Working Group using the process described below. Do not post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This I can agree with. Too often complaints about harassment turn into harassment themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, if your conduct outside the Go community is against our values (below), it may affect your ability to participate within our community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fucking disgrace. It means someone could be excluded from the Go community for voting for the wrong political party, for example!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>J responds to D by asking them to &quot;butt out&quot;.
S emails J privately, noting that J's reaction was uncalled-for, and suggests that J apologize to D.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might do this myself, although probably wouldn't suggest an apology, I'd just say it was inappropriate. Again keeping this private is the best idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go’s type system is so simple even my grandma could understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it's true that most people's grandmas aren't interested in computer programming.</p>
<p>All in all I don't think that people being rude to each other is that much of a problem in free software or open source. I read a lot of email threads as well and don't see it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of utter bullshit makes me mad in a very specific way.  A programming language should just be a programming language.  No politics, just a specification and maybe a compiler/interpreter, etc.  If a community dedicated to a language wants to have it's own stupid microagression rules, I would disagree, but fine, whatever, it's just a website.  But you can't just go making that part of <em>the language itself</em>.  I almost feel like this would be breaking the sanctity of the language.  In the end, all a language is is a collection of rules for a computer to follow to get meaning out of some text/flowchart/whatever.  Computers can't understand politics, so keep that garbage away!</p>

<p>How is one supposed to avoid subconscious behaviour?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>J is a regular poster to the golang-nuts mailing list. On one thread, they make the comment “Go’s type system is so simple even my grandma could understand it.”
Another poster points out that the comment goes against the code of conduct, since it marginalises women and the elderly by implying that something need be simple for an old woman to understand it.</p>

<p>J should have pointed out that he wasn't making an observation about all elderly women, just his grandma who is specifically an idiot.</p></div>

<p>No. No, this is wrong. Who the hell is anyone to tell anyone else what opinions they are allowed to have? In any context? Imagine if Walmart or McDonalds said 'we can hire you but if you work for us you can't vote in ways we don't like and you are not allowed to complain about work to anyone'. That's just fucked up!
