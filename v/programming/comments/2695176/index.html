    <div class="md"><p>Every version of JavaScript builds on the previous versions, so if you learn ES6 you'll still be able to read and understand the vast majority of ES5 code. There were a few tricks in ES5 to make &quot;classes&quot; that don't make a lot of sense if you start with ES6, but so long as you never have to work on a codebase solely developed in ES5, that shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a prototypical language, meaning that it's duck-typed (if it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it is a duck). You can assign any object the prototype of another object and suddenly it is the same type as the other object. With ES6 classes, it looks more like an Object-Oriented language, but it is still a prototypical language under the covers. A big reason that JavaScript has become as popular as it is is because of its support for non-Object Oriented programming paradigms, such as passing functions as arguments to other functions. It has become a popular bed for a sort of &quot;modern Renaissance&quot; into Functional programming paradigms, such as data immutability and pure functions.</p>
<p>As far as learning JavaScript goes, one of the best places to start is on the web. Just search for JavaScript tutorials, there are thousands (millions?) of them.</p>
<p>Really, JavaScript is a good language to start with primarily because you can learn any programming paradigm (Object-Oriented, Functional, etc.) when using it. You're not coerced into any of them, because there is no compiler to enforce a pattern.</p></div>
