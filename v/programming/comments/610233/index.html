I would also suggest you install https everywhere.</p>
<p>Privacy Badger and https everywhere are made by eff.org, a legit place to get this kind of software from, they also support tor (something you can look into as well).</p>
<p>Stay away from adblock, they allow ads now. /2cents</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>They will NOT prevent chrome from doing that.  They can, however, block third party things like facebook if set up properly.  As for the privileges, they need that to work.  No getting around it.  The only way to be sure 100% they themselves aren't doing anything is to read the source code.</p>
<p>If you care about privacy my recommendation would be to use firefox, enable their extra privacy stuff in about:config (under privacy.trackingprotection) and then download and properly configure ublock origin and https everywhere.  That cuts your surface down to Mozilla, the ublock guy, and the EFF.</p></div>
