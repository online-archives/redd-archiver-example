<p>I recall being pressured 20 years ago to focus on something, that the days of end to end systems development from hardware to software were over.

<p>A front end developer that has 10 years of experience will not be as competent as a backend developer that also has 10 years of experience. Even if he makes a just as good job, I bet it will take him more time because he will have to learn a lot in the process.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This post makes me legitimately angry for so many reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Full stack&quot; developer is a bullshit term which really just brings to light the fact that 95% of people in the software industry are fucking morons. Development is development. The only difference between C++, JavaScript, and Lua is syntax. If you aren't &quot;full stack&quot; then you aren't a developer, you're a monkey who memorized a couple of commands</li>
<li>SO MANY FUCKING COMPANIES want to hire someone who's motivated to take ownership of a project, but then they don't compensate them as an owner. &quot;We want you to work from 7am to 11pm and really LOVE what you do.... and we'll pay you $30,000 annual salary (no overtime) and you won't get stock options&quot;. If you want people to feel invested, then give them a fucking stake. I won't care about your profits if I don't get a share of them</li>
<li>SO MANY FUCKING COMPANIES want to hire someone who comes pre-built with all of their ridiculous goddamned demands. &quot;We want someone with 20+ years of experience writing apps on every conceivable platform&quot;. It's called on-the-fucking-job training. Every 5 years the number of software developers doubles. Written another way that means OVER HALF of all software developers have less than 5 years of experience. SO FUCKING TEACH THEM</li>
<li>The reason there are so many fucking job openings is because a bunch of fucking morons think they can make a &quot;software company&quot; and magically produce cash. Every blow joe and his mother wants to make a &quot;million dollar app&quot;, but if it doesn't generate a million dollars of economic value then it's not a fucking million dollar app. There are millions of &quot;me too&quot; companies trying to re-invent the wheel for the 8000th time</li>
<li>The OTHER reason there are so many fucking job openings is because there are so many fucking bad developers. One good developer can do the job of 10 bad ones. Therefore if there are 5 openings per 1 developer that means you need HALF as many developers, but they need to not suck - which would happen if you actually fucking trained people instead of expecting them to front the cost of their own training for 10+ years before getting paid absolute shit</li>
<li>After talking about &quot;unicorns&quot; and &quot;full stack developers&quot; and how companies want to hire a fucking 30+ year experience PhD for pennies on the dollar, they then &quot;solve&quot; the problem by saying you should split your stack and have two dev work entirely independently with no communication on the same product. What the ever-loving fuck?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just a small part of why development is fucking terrible now. I fucking hate what companies have done to programming.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the expectations on developers are often not aligned with reality, that is the point I am making here. Also on the teaching comment I also agree that training and teaching is key to gaining mastery, in fact one of the quotes in the blog specifically addresses this.  About the shitty code comment?  I can’t comment on other companies quality of work (actually having been in tech 29 years I can, but I wont), at Nearsoft we’ve seen some code monkey work over the years ourselves, and have had to do a lot of cleaning up of that code, which in turn has gained us a roster of very happy leading software company clients. Finally I am not suggesting working in silos, quite the contrary, I am suggesting working as teams in a coordinated fashion, but without co-dependency that often slows things down.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and disagree with some of the points above. </p>
<p>First, the difference between C++, JavaScript, and Lua is not only syntax. That statement shows a lack of undestanding of the ecosystem of each language and what the language is commonly used for. I considere myself a backend dev and have been involved in projects that involve a lot of frontend work (JS) such as React and Angular, and to be honest the frontend is as complex as the backend. Applications in the browser are so complex now that they do things like message passing between its components, inmutability, virtual DOM manipulations and so much more. Add to that the you have to know the HTTP protocol indesincracies, the critical redenring path of a browser, CSS quircks, etc and you have pretty hard to write apps in the frontend. The difference is not only syntax. Being an expert in the frontend takes years and I agree with the original post that companies that look unicorns are somewhat delusional. There is a reason why Node.JS became so popular, because the differences between the frontend and the backend are lessened by using the same programming language and ecosystem in both places. I'm sure companies of the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc know this and don't look for unicors when hiring all the time and isntead screen for people that know operating systems design when looking for persons that will work on the windows team and screen for people that know artificial intelligence concepts when looking for someone that wil join the Cortana team.</p></div>
