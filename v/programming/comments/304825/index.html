    <div class="md"><p>Flume, Chet Faker, Glass Animals...probably not what most people code to. I pick this stuff because it's what I like and I always feel motivated and more positive when I listen to good music. I sometimes get distracted but chances are I would have gotten distracted by something else if music wasn't playing. </p>
<p>When I do math though I listen to classical music, especially Bach. And now that I think of it, I would probably be more productive if I were to listen to stuff like that while coding since it's so similar to mathematics. I'd be curious to know if anyone listens to classical music and notices a difference.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are actually three of my current favorite bands, oddly enough. I've never tried coding to them, though. I might have to give that a shot. I can see why Toes, at the very least, would be a good &quot;get things done&quot; song. Most of Gooey probably works for that, now that I think of it.</p>
<p>I've never gotten much into Bach. I was always more of a Erik Satie kind of guy.</p>
<p>Lately I've been listening to random Vaporwave while I code. It doesn't have lyrics and a lot of it is upbeat, which helps a little with motivation. I'm not a huge fan of the genre, but I thought it somehow fitting.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I listen to a lot of random music when I do. Depends on my mood prior to writing code. Sometimes opera, sometimes Something Corporate, sometimes Mr. Chief, but generally speaking I have a playlist for when I code with a mixture of different types of music. I also like to listen to the Kingdom Hearts OST, which I have on my phone so it works out. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Trance-ish type stuff on Spotify, usually found on the ASOT show.</p>
<p>I sometimes listen to music with lyrics, but I find they can distract me. Instrumental only seems to provide enough distraction from the outside world and random thoughts passing through my head, while not distracting me from the task at hand. I often say that the most productivity-enhancing technology ever created is a pair of headphones.</p></div>
