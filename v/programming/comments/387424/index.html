<p>I'm not sure if there's a huge amount of support, as <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming">/v/programming</a> seems to be where a lot of news related stuff goes already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello again,</p>
<p>It looks like you're still tired of the github in action type posts... I don't think they will die any time soon, either.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/comments/404524">In light of this</a>,</p>
<p>I would like to again request thinking about changing the rule that submissions must contain code/ be directly related to programming and the sub rules be more inclusive about the content that can be posted here, since the user base seems to appreciate a lot of posts that might not directly relate to programming.</p>
<p><a href="/user/atko">@atko</a> specifically referenced the way <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/technology">r/technology</a> on reddit banned Tesla posts, just because the mod was tired of seeing Tesla content dominate the sub.</p>
<p>Once again, I appreciate the discussion and transparency that you've had.</p></div>
