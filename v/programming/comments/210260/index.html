<p>To narrow the question some more, what technologies should I learn in order to start this project; I know I will need to learn C++, but what else?</p>
<p>Heres an image of what the finished product should look like: <a href="http://www.foobar2000.org/images/img/main-black.png">http://www.foobar2000.org/images/img/main-black.png</a></p>
<p><strong>edit::</strong>
I already have experience with C, and am looking to make my media player as lightweight as possible, and cross platform, this is why I chose C++ as opposed to Python, Java, and C#.</p></div>

<p>Now, libraries — is what important. You surely will need some GUI library, and some media codecs too.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to break down the project in terms of all libraries you'll need. So, GUI, playing music from files, accessing the file system, playing music from a stream and so on. For the GUI part, if you wanna make it as customizable as foobar's, you wanna make sure the library you use allows for that level of control over its GUI elements. Basically, just think of all the basic elements of the program and try to find some libraries that implement each individual piece. Use whatever language you feel more comfortable with that also has those libraries. And just start researching and trying things out.</p></div>
