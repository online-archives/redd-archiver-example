<p>*For those who don't know unity its a game engine that has physics and math built in. So all you have to do to make a game is know how to put the pieces on the board and a little bit of scripting. You can get all the models and graphics you need from their store.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair Unity sucks, and the reason it sucks is C#. The reason that C# sucks is the garbage collection has to be spayed and neutered in order not to piss on all your hard work and run at fairly random and inconvenient intervals.This is tolerable for almost any other application, but not for gaming. Try playing a game you really really love, and then try the engine for it. Unity has a ton of games I've never played. But quake, I would play even today in a heartbeat, so quake engine would be my goto.</p>
<p>There's a shit ton of game engines out there, and what Unity fucks up with in how well it runs it makes up for in OS compatibility. So if you want a piece of shit that runs on several operating systems, Unity is a great choice.</p>
<p>Edit: And oh...it's not cheap either.</p></div>
