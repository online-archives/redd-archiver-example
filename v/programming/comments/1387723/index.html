<p>Self respect?  Some of us enjoy coding?</p>
<p>I am one of these ol' farts;  still a foot soldier,  partly by choice,  partly by lack of the social / political skills required to get into management.  Funny thing is that I have mostly reached my FI (financial independence) target a wee while back,  so the day I am no longer enjoying the game,  I'll just kick back and retire (i.e.,  work on my own projects instead :-) )</p>
<p>ps and I'll keep behaving like a teenager as long as I am still enjoying it too,  you darn kid.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I fall 4 years short of the 34 year mark. I count decades because it's less intimidating for younger developers to hear 3 decades rather than 30 years when you're introducing yourself and giving background info on your experience. I still act like a teenager/20-something because I may have grown old but I never really grew up. It's more fun being young at heart. I did try the management path for a while including becoming a product manager but I missed the action and hated the useless (to me) social pandering needed to get interface with upper management. I'm in the trenches again where I'm happy so I will probably stay here until I can't do it any more. Why be boring and old when I can be old and still have shitloads of fun doing cool things?</p>
<p>When I started programming it was in the before time when PCs were still fighting to gain the top spot. My first paying programming gig (1986) involved writing Z-80 assembly code for embedded microcontrollers used in data acquisition on fuel pumps. I wrote code on a Morrow Designs MD-11 and a Kaypro II and burned the resulting compiled code to EPROMs for the microcontrollers. I didn't touch a PC (IBM compatible) till 1989 when I did some projects on commission in QuickBASIC. From there I bounced around the 90s programming in DBase, Borland C, Visual Basic, Delphi and VC++ (MFC/ATL). In the more recent times I've settled into C# mostly because it's easy to get work in my area with that. I miss the old days of Win32 programming where it was you and the bare metal but it's nice to make things happen quickly and with less hassle. I still have a special place in my heart for ActionScript and Adobe Flex because that was a fun language/framework that let my creative side play with my technical side and make awesome stuff. I despise modern web programming but that's a much bigger discussion that doesn't fit here. I've forgotten more programming things than most of my colleagues have learned so I feel weird and out of place at times until my dinosaur knowledge saves the day and I'm a rockstar again for a while. It's fun and I wouldn't really want to do much else professionally if given the opportunity.</p></div>
