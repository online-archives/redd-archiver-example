<p>Over 65,000+ developers responded from all over the world. If you <a href="https://i.imgjar.co/jar/N7N9_s8cU0We6PJL1QFqVg.PNG">look down to the demographics</a> of the respondents, you'll notice something interesting. Despite the left's desire to make women the God-Empresses of all things STEM, only 7.6% of the respondents reported as female. 88.6% were male, and the other 3.8% identified as mentally retarded. </p>
<p>It's funny, it's almost like women, in general, prefer not to go into programming fields... There are those that want to paint women into a corner. &quot;If you're not into STEM, then you're somehow lesser,&quot; they claim. This is why they push so hard to get women into STEM fields, even if those women don't want to. If their philosophy is true, then this survey shows that women are <em>faaaaar</em> more inferior than men. Or maybe it doesn't matter if you're in STEM fields or not; maybe men and women have different interests and men happen to enjoy programming more, in general, than women?</p>
<p>There is a ton of other interesting info, like the <a href="https://i.imgjar.co/jar/aBq7zm34z0iluxcBimckGQ.PNG">ethnicity of the respondents</a>.</p>
<p>Just thought this was interesting and worth sharing.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about programming is that in a proper shop there's zero room for emotional arguments and ego. Facts rule everything. You think your plan is better? Then you'd better have hard numbers or some seriously solid reasoning to justify using it over someone else's method. I'm not saying women are incapable of this, but they tend to make emotional arguments. Those simply will not fly when you're talking about compiler optimization, database scaling, host replication, etc. </p>
<p>Having said that, I've worked with some great women in the industry and they've understood this. I have a feeling that the same people that are making emotional pleas for &quot;more women in STEM&quot; would not understand this. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. In my 20+ years as a developer, I've had the chance to work with many women in the industry. </p>
<p>For the most part I've respected most of them. The one's I tend to respect and they also get the respect of the team are the ones who can figure things out on their own, contribute ideas to the team even though they get shot down; because sometimes they do get great ideas but also know not every idea is a winner, when the team works late; they work late, when the team goes out for team events; they join and become part of the crowd. The one's that don't get any respect are the ones that after contributing one idea and get shot down, escalate saying its because they are a female, even tho they are behind on work, they clock out at 5pm leaving the work to be picked up by another team member, never figure out anything even tho the concept could have been googled, and want guys to do work for them because they are female, yet complain all the time about not getting equal treatment. </p>
<p>The latter seems more over the past 5+ years. I think it has to do with the progressive left movements that are forcing women down development teams throats. Most women today aren't qualified but get hired because they are female. I've actually seen incompetent women programmers get promoted to team lead because they couldn't program but no one wanted to fire them. My recent job, that I recently left, there was a muslim female who was so fucking entitled, and would always say she'd rather be programming and all the devs including female devs would have a joke, where they would say, No they don't want her to program. </p>
<p>She's taken every small low risk project and turned them into $500k-$1000k fiascos when the project estimate was for less than 1 month for 3 people including her. Her 1 month projects are always finished about 9 months later and clients usually refuse to take delivery or would have to be coerced into taking delivery yet she still works there after screwing up 3 projects pretty badly since i've been working with her. There are other female programmers, not much maybe 1 for every 20 male developers. But she's the most hated by all developers male and female alike. </p>
<p>Ironically because of her more people end up in management meetings for insulting her or disrespecting her in some way. Like I was called in because in a meeting I had my laptop open and was working while she was talking. Context of it was she kept picking up her cell phone every 3-5 minutes and would talk for like 10-15 minutes each time. So I got tire of waiting and opened up my laptop and tried to get some work done so she went and told the director how I'm disrespectful to her in meeting and won't pay attention. </p>
<p>Women who can work, does the work, takes pride in their work, ask for help, offers help, gets respect. Women who don't work, always late in finishing work, yet clock out and leave early are never respected. It sounds like a great meritocracy to me. Because the guys are treated in the same way.</p></div>

<p>Sadly enough I also have witnessed this with males. Sometimes you wonder wtf is wrong with the managers for keeping them. The answer is mostly because he is such a social good guy.</p>
<p>Also the victim playing, I have seen many males play the victim card why again their projects refuse to work. They always blame it on something else, like the wrong Windows service pack installed, the wrong version of the OS, the wrong firmware on that notebook, the wrong version of Flash installed. Must be 13.0.1.6532 and you installed 13.0.1.6522..... And fro some strange reason managers keep these idiots destroying every project they get in their hands for years. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Incompetent men can screw up projects just like incompetent women. The only difference is, its not taboo for developers to speak to managers about the incompetent male whereas it is considered taboo to speak against incompetent women. In my case, I made mention of the problems that was causing the problems with her project and I was pulled into a meeting with the director. Mind you, I take on more riskier projects and for the most part have a great on time on budget delivery record, therefore I was just spoken to vs let go like in other cases. </p>
<p>In that department, I saw incompetent men have less than 4 week lifecycle where they were given extra chances but at the end of about 4 weeks if they haven't improved, they were let go. She's been there for over 2+ years and promoted because her code sucked.</p>
<p>But the one female had 2 PC stereotypes going for her. She was female and she was also muslim. </p></div>

<p>One would think so but I have met a lot of developers that have an ego the size of a planet. And somehow these people befriends the managers and they stay in the company for many years.</p>
<p>It is amazing how managers gets so easily fooled by these big ego and victim blaming developers. I have always wondered why, but I think these managers lack technical knowledge and don't want to admit that they don't know what you are talking about. So they lock onto the guy that acts the most cool.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>As I told my GF, the developers world is one of the harshest and brutal career you can take. It takes 24/7/365 effort to keep your knowledge up to date.</p>
<p>Forcing everyone to learn coding, and forcing women to choose for STEM will put all these people that are unfit into a burn-out within a few years. </p>
<p>On top of that software developing is always disappointing because you work very hard and no one understands what you do. And one of the weird things is that code that looks elegant and easy to understand is actually the hardest to create. Managers don't get impressed if these 100 readable lines is all you did in the last week. They get impressed when the idiot created 10,000 lines of code all linq statements no one understands.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a few possible reasons why there are so few women in programming:</p>
<ul>
<li>For them, staring at a screen all day long is extremely boring and uncool.</li>
<li>It isn't aligned with their biological imperatives. It's well known that women tend to be better at communicating and forming relationships than men, so they may be more attracted to fields that will allow to them to leverage those skills.</li>
<li>There's a &quot;herd effect&quot;. Programming is &quot;seen&quot; as mainly a man thing by other women, so they don't pursue it.</li>
<li>It's a very harsh world for different reasons, and they've already heard about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are there so few men in nursing? The reasons are probably similar.</p></div>
