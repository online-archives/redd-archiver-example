    <div class="md"><p>A central problem with this approach is that, at least in the form presented here, it doesn't guarantee accuracy. There will always be a probability (presumably low, but nevertheless non-zero) of error. Whilst this may be useful in some areas it's not obvious to me that it's always a desirable approach. How would you feel about a system that mostly got your bank balance correct, but occasionally got it wrong? And how about a system that, for example, monitors some mission-critical component? Would you feel happy with a system that &quot;mostly&quot; got things right when it comes to your heart monitor, or &quot;mostly&quot; spotted problematic objects in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceguard">Spaceguard</a>?</p>
<p>I don't deny that this is an interesting way of building on ideas in the cellular automaton tradition, but I'm not yet convinced that it can be exploited in a real world problem.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, accuracy vs robustness. But I think it comes down to what you want to build. </p>
<p>The bank account, for example, could get &quot;enough&quot; accuracy if the chain was long enough. Imagine the accuracy of his Horde Demon Sorter if it were to extend thousands of cells in each direction. If a glitch were to occur, the frequency would be so low, that it <em>could</em> outweigh the benefit of precise computing. Yes there will be errors, but they wont crash the entire system like we are used to today.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly. I think it would be very difficult to persuade senior management in many commercial firms to adopt this approach without a paradigm shift in the way corporations make their decisions. Imagine the conversation in the board room:</p>
<p>&quot;The CTO advocates that we switch to this new system that is 99.9999% reliable. There will never be any hardware failures, but about 0.000001 of our bank balance calculations will be wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good. What's the reliability of the existing system?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we aim for 100% accuracy in our bank balance calculations, but we have occasional hardware problems that prevent us from reporting any bank balances at all. This happens about once in 100,000 transactions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you're offering us a choice between a system that goes wrong one time in a million, or a system that doesn't tell people anything at all one time in one hundred thousand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll stick with the existing system. Failing to deliver any information is a better outcome than delivering incorrect information.&quot;</p>
<p>And this is before the legal officer steps in with questions about legal liability!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. The 'suits' wouldn't approve anything like that.</p>
<p>But if we think ahead a little. What if the margin of error was more in the order of 1:10^100? What if they no longer had to care about backups and other redundancies?</p>
<p>Then it starts becoming a question of funding. If you spend $100M per year having techs/programmers on standby, and buying replacement hardware (yes, hardware would need to be replaced in a MFM system as well - but is done cheaper because of the modular design - I think), you'd probably be happy to hear that it could be cut in half with another system (pure speculation here).</p>
<p>I think the concept has merit - but a very poor language for our current x86 architecture.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to elaborate on where I think it has merit.</p>
<p>Nanotech - The ability to recreate entire systems after damage will come in very handy for these little fellas - or just for general communication between them (think about how hard threading is today - now write a program that utilizes a million threads efficiently).</p>
<p>Aerospace - One of the issues today is slow communication, or no communication at all (because some circuit got 'to close to the sun' and got fried). With a MFM system, the satellite or whatever could simply bypass faulty hardware on the fly, and regenerate the routines that are now missing.</p>
<p>But it's a very different way of programming. Instead of 'paths' we must create 'rules'.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps in domains where verifying that an answer is correct is easy, but finding the answers is hard.  Perhaps at the output nodes you verify that a result is correct, and if not, feed the data back in to the input layer.</p>
<p>My confusion with this idea is whether it is easy or even possible to express interesting problems, and whether it can solve problems efficiently.  This example strikes me as an over-engineered bubble-sort.  I can't tell if he is just trying to provide inspiration with fun toy examples, or if this is a sketch of a more concrete idea that would make more sense but would be too technical for the type of video he's trying to create.</p>
<p>The other thing is, if this is talking about distributed computing, it seems like it might be leaving a lot out.  He doesn't talk about how the grid maps to actual compute resources.  Or how nodes discover their neighbors and so on.</p>
<p>I guess I could take a look at the paper ...</p></div>
