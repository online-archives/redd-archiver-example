<p>It seems that employers are getting very tired of interviewing unqualified people from coding bootcamps. You might even be better off hiding it if you went to one when applying for jobs.</p></div>

<p>The hallmark of a good developer is that they figuring it out all themselves. Use that money that you would waste on bootcamps on books, software and hardware that you purchase.</p>
<p>These bootcamps are money sucking scams and are even dangerous. Because they force you in a fixed mindset and bad coding practices that will take years to unlearn. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Folks who come out of those are very similar to most Indians who just graduated from a tech college over there.  That is not a compliment.  You are much better off to pick a language to start with and see how you can do on your own.  If you hit a wall early and can't figure anything out with all of the doc and message boards available on the internet then you won't survive as a coder anyway.  Truth is, 99% of coding is not what you know as much as how quickly you can figure out something you don't know.  We joke about StackOverflow and GoogleFu but that shit is the lifeblood of any coder.  </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be a way to start coding. Give you some of the basics and helps you get motivated. It all depends on if it's cheap.</p>
<p>The problem with online courses is that most people don't complete them. So maybe these bootcamps are a good way to get the basics. But you're not a coder after a bootcamp. You'll need a lot of practice before becoming a real coder.</p>
<p>The best way to become a coder is give yourself a project and take it to its completion. Better is to get paid for a small programming job - even if you get paid peanuts. Like freelancer.om. Best way to learn. You'll be even more motivated to follow online courses when you can directly apply the knowledge.</p>
<p>The key is motivation.</p></div>

<p>Python Beginner Tutorial 1 (For Absolute Beginners) 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpPG0bKHYKc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpPG0bKHYKc</a></p>
<p>Calling other people elitists assholes or saying that you didn't want a work anyway just a hobby is not a very good mindset for becoming a developer even a hobbyist. The problem with coding is that you will slam into walls every second of your  time. Examples you see online won't work in your project and you can fail for hours even days not understanding what you did wrong. </p>
<p>Software development is not very rewarding because you really work very hard in the code but at the surface you don't see any change. Then you see something visually change but it does not do what you had in mind and you have to dig into the deeper layers to discover why and how to fix it. You only succeed if you push true, develop a mindset of a winner and take no prisoners.</p>
<p>Bootcamps will initially give you fast results but as the teaching goes further they also induce a fixed uncreative thinking that will lock you in the only course you have followed. Your mind will be fixed to that only solution and all your projects will fail in the next few years. They fail because the technology world will have changed and you are still stuck in that ancient bootcamp mindset. Unlearning what you learned in a bootcamp takes minimal 2 years. </p>
<p>Even if you only want to take up developing as a hobby, you need a mindset that shows off that you are the boss over this code you just written. If you don't then that code is destined to fail even on your own small projects</p></div>
