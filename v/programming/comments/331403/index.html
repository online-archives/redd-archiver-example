    <div class="md"><p>The article puts it nicely  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the internet, and I’m here to learn about other people’s thoughts, not be protected from them.<br />
[...]<br />
Here is the problem with using offensiveness as a standard in a code of conduct:<br />
    * It judges the speaker by the listener’s opinions.<br />
    * Opinions are subjective and cannot be known by the speaker until after they speak.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not even mad about stuff like that anymore. I'm just tired of it.<br />
I couldn't give any less of a fuck about anyone's feelings when reading what I write, more so when it comes to code or anything else that underlies logic or some natural law.<br />
Just don't be a dick. Although if someone is known for repeatedly not putting any effort into their questions and show no eagerness to learn from their mistakes, you're fair game.  
</p>
<p>I'm glad to have access to a world wide community I am free to share my ideas with and get (hopefully constructive) criticism.<br />
And the more this 'safe space' mentality spreads the more I fear progress is hampered by restricting thoughts and ideas in exchange for coziness..
If your code sucks you should be told so and not pampered because it could hurt your feelings. Otherwise we will deal with the same shit over and over again.<br />
Opinion-based arguments are something else though. Empirical, unambiguous data should be used to determine who's right, if possible to avoid emotional quarrel but that's just me.</p></div>

<p>Yes. If people are failing to get offended on the internet then it's clearly not working as intended. We need to figure out the source of the problem and submit a pull ticket.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This talks a great deal about offense and the right (or lack thereof) to 'not be offended'.</p>
<p>I think a far greater flaw with this code is the explicit statement that &quot;we will not tolerate discrimination based on [...] technical ability&quot;.</p>
<p>The act of developing software explicitly requires technical ability. The machine will discriminate between correct and incorrect code. Their attempt to make technical competence irrelevant to the process of software development is inherently broken, and the fact that they suggest anything of the sort shows a deep lack of connection between the authors of the code and the subject matter they attempt to address.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I complete disagree with the path we are taking right now as developers as community.</p>
<p>Code of conducts, gender-only conferences and all other related things are turning the developer's world into a sort of unstable community.
If I say that one doesn't know how-to-code, later figuring out that is a her, I would probably be banned and burned by the SJW.</p>
<p>I also completely disagree with the necessity to have groups like &quot;Girls Who Code&quot;, &quot;Rails Girls&quot;, &quot;Women Who Code&quot;, etc... why they don't come to the all other conferences instead of creating one women-only? This is a kind-of discrimination.</p>
<p>At this point, I would actually want to see if somebody will ever come up with a &quot;Blacks that Code&quot; or &quot;Hispanic that Code&quot;, both of them are minorities in the IT world and no one gives a heck about them. Code of Conduct will drive us into the hell of not being anymore able to have a serious confrontation. Without confrontations the community will never evolve anymore, we will lose smart developers driving open source projects because an opinion offended someone and they got kicked out or, even worser, banned from the platform. This is going to be the future of Github.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>While I generally agree with the sentiment of your comment, I think gender specific groups can be a good thing. Coding and suchlike is very much a male dominated field, and if we can give some extra support to encourage the fairer sex to get involved and make them feel welcome and more comfortable joining such a scene, that's gotta be a good thing.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://djangogirls.org/">Django Girls</a> for instance. Just from looking at their site for a few minutes, the photos seem to show that it's not strictly a &quot;male free zone&quot; and their events seem to be part of larger Python related ones. They contribute tutorials, blogs, set up classes, and promote the Django platform.</p>
<p>I think I get the point you were making, but let's be careful not to lump these rabid feminazis that contribute nothing useful with genuine groups that benefit the wider community. And you're dead right about confrontations sometimes being necessary. Anyone who's read the Debian or Linux Kernel mailing lists should realise that :)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Code of conduct is used by sites like github and others to push an agenda while making it 'acceptable' for general populace who for the most part has become so fixated on social justice that they fail to see free speech component of the issue. Code of conduct is a solution to problem that does not exist. It's also a blunt tool to silence and bully people.</p>
<p>What made hacker / programming community great is its relentless drive to make things better. Sometimes it means telling stupid people that they are stupid, or saying that stupid idea is stupid. This also means that you have a rowdy culture (which I rather prefer) which some labeled 'bro' culture. I think there is a distinction to be made here, 'bro' culture is very different from 'hacker' culture.</p>
<p>Hacker / programming community also has what's called natural order. Someone who contributes a lot to the project, which hundreds may benefit from, should be listened to. Have you seen House MD? While it gives no one the right to be jerks, I think immense contribution they make should afford them some leeway in dealing with the counter-productive or actions unrelated to benefit of the coding project. SJWs in general decided to jump in on the fray, using the highground they achieved on the platform field (e.g. github.com). What they are wrong about is that they believe SJWing is what made coding communities like github great. It's not. None of the coders posted their code thinking it will make everyone safe and sound from offense. They coded and pushed code because it's their passion. </p>
<p>SJWs are conflating the economic success of San Francisco to their dogma - it's wrong. Their whole stinking edifice will come crumbling down when people realize this is a load of crap.</p></div>
