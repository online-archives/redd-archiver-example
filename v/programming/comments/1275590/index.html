    <div class="md"><p>C is fundamentally a subset of C++. If you simply restrict yourself to a subset of capability, you can treat C++ exactly like C. C# vs C++ is where fundamental differences start to come into play.</p>
<p>If you're consider which language to learn I'd always recommend going from the bottom-up: assembly, C, C++, C#. This is not commonly recommended since the lower level languages are quite challenging to wrap your head around for a new developer, but if you can manage it you'll achieve a far greater understanding of niceties each language gifts you with and their underlying costs that can allow you to develop far more robust and performant programs than somebody who started at the top.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>C# is more closely related to Java than C++. It's easier deal with than either of those in my opinion, but that's really up to personal preference. Up until recently you were locked into Microsoft's playground if you wanted to use it with any real support, the Mono project notwithstanding, so a lot of people have avoided it for that reason. I can't really blame them given Microsoft's tendency to hold out an olive branch only to shoot you if you go to grab it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Assembly is the mnemonics for opcodes, you can calculate out each op code ahead of time then fire it into instruction memory for really fast results. You'd be basically doing Assembly to machine code by hand. Only really a thing you'd see in embedded programming when you have to shave off any unnecessary clock cycles where resources are extremely scarce or when your brand new x86 processor is being evaluated in the lap only to discover that certain instructions are returning incorrect values and you need a bit of microcode to correct it (also happens with GPUs all the time).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'd never use the word advanced since it's going to bring out the &quot;strongly opinionated fans&quot; of one language or the other. I ordered them in terms of <em>&quot;What, why can't I [do thing from other language]?&quot;</em> You're never going to find yourself missing a feature from assembly in C. You're never going to find yourself missing a feature from C in C++. And you're [almost] never going to find yourself missing a feature from C++ in C#. There are a couple of exceptions there like neat things you can do with templates such as template meta programming, and things that are nasty as like multiple inheritance, but in general it's true. C# was designed to take the best of a variety of languages including C++, Smalltalk, and Java and create a modern language featuring all the strengths of those languages while minimizing their individual weaknesses. It's for this reason that you'll find updates to the C++ standard regularly borrowing things that are already present in C#. It's also for this reason that having a very good understanding of what's being abstracted away, like memory management, is absolutely crucial. </p></div>

<p>I agree with you. Programming degrees should focus on the basics. Then students can branch out from a solid core instead of knowing parts of all the branches and none of the roots. I mean, you can't navigate a binary tree from a random node, you have to start at the root node. The same applies to learning how to program.</p></div>

<p>Hes that guy that pushes everyone around him to use Linux and acts like you can be on par with how you'd use Windows overnight because again hes been using it since the late 90s and its ingrained knowledge to him, you know that kind of snobbery of how much more superior Linux might be while ignoring the fact that doing anything more advanced than browsing the web can be a real struggle just trying to find valid information on how you'd go about fixing the problem can take a lot of time as well as trial and error. He'd know that he can do this, this, and that to fix the problem were as a novice would putter around trying to find out how to start the few first steps. Some people are just totally unaware of how many niche things they know and how much effort its taken for them to gain that knowledge.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>AVR micros get a but funny when you accidentally change a port fuse and nuke a port pin. Arduino stuff was introduced to us last semester and theres nothing wrong with it or AVR micrcos but using Arduinos native language would hog up a lot of program memory space if you wern't careful when things got more elaborate than flashing LEDs and needed a internet connected sensor that also had a user interface so some of us learned a little AVR C as a way to save an awful lot of program space, quite a few of us managed to permanently damage their microcontrollers very quickly.</p>
<p>PIC also uses one really well developed, really powerful, really helpful tool called MPLAB where we could simulate most if not all of a supported PIC's functionality before programming it meaning you can get really nitty gritty over usage of program or instruction memory. Theres a like for like equivalent for AVR but those fuses potentially a nightmare for my colleges lectures and maintenance. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I don't like that in most universities they teach you first stuff like Java and the like, and then move to lower level. You need to understand how the computer works internally to be able to program good imho, and high-level programming languages teach you the other way around. They are very useful, but once you know how the lower bits work!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I also believe that all programming degrees should require a course on compilers. That was seriously the most helpful class I took at university, it really tied together a lot of the random bits and pieces of knowledge I'd accumulated up to that point, and it allows me to write better code because I understand how compilers work now.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely hate OO and I wasn't even programming in 1994. Interfaces are ok, but don't go far enough (type classes are more powerful and useful) but subtype polymorphism is just cancer. Attributing ownership of functions to datatypes is only reusable if you introduce internal states, which is a huge cause for bugs in major projects. Internal states should be reserved for very few things like thread-safety and encapsulated into explicit contexts, instead of that in OO every single object potentially has hidden internal state.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The right tool for the job. OOP is very helpful for expressing business logic. If you are writing a fixed set of instructions, something like take this string and send it via SMTP, then you might as well stay with C.</p>
<p>You can easily emulate OOP in C, but nobody wants to write all that extra code.</p></div>

<p>&quot;Oh well C++ is just an extension of C, it can do everything C does and more...&quot; is a fucking retarded statement. That's like arguing a 13 wheel car is inherently better than a 4 wheel car.</p></div>
