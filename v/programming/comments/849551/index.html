<p>I've thrown together a list of potential ways to make money out of the skills I have, and wouldn't mind some input from developers who have been doing it for a while on either alternatives or advice on how to make these ideas work.</p>
<p>Going freelance: I've been learning about web development  for a bit so this is the most obvious option, but I'm not overly enthused about being subjected to someone else's whims. Still a possibility, though.</p>
<p>WordPress plugins: I've done game development in java using the Android sdk but ultimately quit because there are way too many developers willing to be worked to the bone for peanuts, and I get the feeling that doing WordPress plugins (and web development in general) will be more of the same, given that everybody with a MacBook wants to be a web designer.</p>
<p>Utilites/browser plugins: given the right inspiration, definitely a possibility, but maybe hard to monetize.</p>
<p>Web scraping: Being familiar with markup (and being personally interested in this) might make this a possibility. Either selling whatever data I collect (unlikely), creating a service around the data (seemingly plausible) or using the data for my own personal use to understand certain markets and create something tailored to that market (maybe difficult, but seemingly plausible).</p></div>

<p>I've been learning about web development</p>

<p>Consider doing whatever you can to get a junior position at a <em>reputable</em> digital/ad agency. They'll give you plenty to do and probably burn you out after years, but the web industry experience should be substantial (otherwise, quit).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wordpress plugins</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since WordPress is free to begin with, I don't see much money in this. But do explore and enjoy creating features people want.</p>
<p>I've done heavy freelance and heavy full-time development. </p>
<p>If you go freelance, remember that you are the: account representative, project manager, designer, developer, [possibly] copywriter and more. You're responsible for all your bug fixes and sick days don't exactly exist. You're also your own tax rep, as even if you hire one you'll most certainly need to be on top of your taxes.</p>
<p>If you go full-time, even with &quot;junior&quot; status at a web, software, or digital agency with a team of 10+ to share and learn from you could gain a lot of momentum in the industry versus knocking out some 1099 (misc income) cash gigs.</p>
<p>If it wasn't obvious, I'd suggest interviewing at places which can move your career, and building followup projects if you get rejected.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Freelancing is going to be your best bet, if you don't want to take a job as a developer.</p>
<p>Start with your local craigslist, place an ad advertising your services, and then start replying to stuff in webdev gigs, and internet engineers.
From there branch out to other states.</p>
<p>You could write a scraper to find potential gigs for you on craigslist (though CL is pretty good about detecting scrapers)</p>
<p>I dunno about plugins, but you can make some passive income on the envato marketplace (<a href="http://market.envato.com/">http://market.envato.com/</a>) with wordpress/drupal/magento themes and snippets.</p>
<p>As you get recurring clients for webdev work, see if they'd be interested in managed hosting services. Go buy yourself an EC2 instance, or digital ocean droplet, learn how to use nginx or apache and you can likely undercut whatever hosting service your clients are using.</p>
<p>Though that last bit might take some security experience to be worthwhile. Doesn't look good if you (as a host) get pwned by skids with webshells.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of Indians flood the market now so picking up work if you don't have a presence on say ... WP forums is going to be tough.</p>
<p>Envato was suggested below and that might be a good start. However, look at what's popular and also realize that getting several thousands of buyers isn't all tang realistic.</p>
<p>Getting money up front or at least half is a must. I've been fucked before. Not everybody is an ass but make sure you only demo on your own site.</p>

<p>I'd still say local dev shops would probably have enough work to supply you with pocket money.</p>
<p>If you could be usable within 6 months and handle learning Java lots of temp companies would probably consider taking a risk on you at least once.</p>

<p>Lots of Indians flood the market now so picking up work if you don't have a presence on say ... WP forums is going to be tough.</p>

<p>I've found this not being much of a problem. Their quality of work is laughable. I've had leads return after couple months asking me to rebuild their brand new website after the Indians fucked it thoroughly through and through.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Worked as an independent programming contractor for about three decades, doing various sorts of systems, anything from accounting to programming tools, in maybe twenty languages.  It pays well but the work is intermittent, and requires a good social network.  It's got rough ten, fifteen years ago when contract agencies decided the only way to grow in a saturated market was to run the independents out of business.  I held out for a few more years, then went corporate, but there are still a good many niches where an independent can thrive, most notably in handset / tablet software.</p></div>
