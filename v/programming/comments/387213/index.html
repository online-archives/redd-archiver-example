<h2>Community wars on &quot;social justice&quot; (Whatever that is)</h2>
<p>I'd like to take a moment to reiterate on the recent events on GitHub and &quot;SJW&quot; trolling on services targeted at programmers. The submissions ranged from &quot;Codes of Conducts&quot; over interesting decisions on banning repositories to the boycott domain. I already posted a <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/371626/1536868">lengthy comment here</a> on it. I don't want to repeat it as a whole here. As a user, I'm not pleased with current events. That doesn't mean that the subverse will take a stance in favor or against those actions. I want this place to be political neutral as much as possible. Everything else is feeding trolls. And feeding trolls is a waste of time.</p>
<p>While I won't just begin now to delete these submissions (See the next chapter please), they are also reaching a mass of where they're just too much. Honestly, I'm tired of seeing them.</p>
<p>Thus I'd like to <strong>hear your opinion</strong> on how to manage this. Leave it as it is, or have something like a Rant/Drama Friday 'megathread'? Or something else?</p>
<h2>Trolling, CENSORSHIP, and I'm literally reddit</h2>
<p><strong>This paragraph is more from me as a person and less about <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming">/v/programming</a>'s moderator stuff.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes I think that some users don't know what a moderator is. A moderator is not there to win popularity contests. A moderator (tries to!) keeps the community running by sorting out stuff that doesn't belong into it, and may impose rules to try to cater to the community. Q.E.D.</p>
<p>Please, don't spout crap like &quot;The reddit mod-type is strong with this one.&quot; <em>[sic!]</em> and don't cry censorship if my opinion differs from yours. I'd rather have a smaller community than a big one full of trolls. You can quote me on that. I mean it. Always remember that I'm also a person. I'm not in the mood of fighting every waking hour about stuff if someone posts a rant on censorship in here or whatever. I don't want to be the guy who pulls the delete lever. But, mindless ranting shows me that the person is not capable of structured discussions, and that maybe the loss of that individual is not so bad for the mass. I'm sorry that I have to say that. I do know however that most people understand it. I don't want to piss you off. We may disagree. Some may not like me, and I may not like everyone. That's life. That's perfectly fine and <strong>won't</strong> get you banned or anything like that (That would be really insane!). If you don't agree with this paragraph, you're, as always, free to discuss this in here. Please don't rant on me. That would just show why I had to say that. Please proof me wrong.</p>
<p>On a more general note, things will go wrong. You will mess up, and I will also mess up. Please bear with me and I'll bear with you.</p>
<p>On a related note, by being a welcoming and open community, we can also proof the &quot;triggered&quot;-by-existence &quot;SJWs&quot; wrong. Would be a win win for everyone I guess.</p>
<p>I'm always all ears when someone posts constructive criticism, and if at all possible, ideas to improve upon it.</p>
<h2>CSS / The design</h2>
<p>There are some scattered voices that would enjoy a different look on this subverse. Please know that you can probably use user-defined (&quot;custom&quot;) stylesheets if you so desire, a recent submission by <a href="https://voat.co/user/TCGM">@TCGM</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/380767">here</a> should get you set up if interested.</p>
<p>In general, I think we're best off if the subverse stays overall vanilla with some touch up here and there to serve our needs. For one, it doesn't make a difference <em>to me</em> if something is gray/lightgray or e.g blue/lightblue. We're also not designers (Well, maybe some are?), and at least I for one don't pretend to know what's good for the user CSS-wise. Oh, and not having to learn 50 ways of navigation on voat would also be great ;)</p>
<p>However, I admit that the sidebar could me made smaller. The chat (Does that even work?) is huge, and maybe one could also rearrange the stuff around the subscribe button a bit to save some vertical space.</p>
<h2>I think that's it.</h2>
<p>So yeah. This will be sticky till Monday at around 10AM in some random time zone I'll choose then. (Yes, that means sometime on Monday).</p>
<p><strong>Discuss!</strong></p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In regards to Social Justice, I think that highlighting when a service/tool commonly used by programmers starts going on a censorship spree, and providing alternatives, is valuable. Various other programming news websites (<em>cough</em>) silently remove such content, making it much harder to determine when a service has 'gone rogue'</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding the design, it looks fine to me.</p>
<p>Regarding submissions, if they're about programming / software development, let them be. In a free-speech zone (the whole point of Voat!), there's no room for &quot;there's too much of this&quot; or &quot;I'm tired of seeing that&quot; when it comes to the overseeing of content. I've seen people on reddit's <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/programming">r/programming</a>, for example, exclaim that they're tired of seeing so much Java stuff. That kind of opinion is out of bounds when it comes to on-topic neutrality.</p>
<p>Topics rise and fall in popularity. That's reality, not any kind of unraveling of community fabric. If it's on-topic, let it flow and let the voats do the judging.</p></div>
