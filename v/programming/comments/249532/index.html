Full disclosure: I have Sublime Text. I happily paid for it after using an unregistered copy for about a month. Sublime's <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/eula">EULA</a> only goes over it being copyright work, what computers you can use it on, and that they aren't held liable if it crashes and you didn't save for 3 hours. I have no qualms with paying $70 USD for my privacy.</p></div>

The same type of EULA and privacy statements has been for all of Microsoft's pre-releases, and they have always changed it into being opt-in on the actual release.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that trade-off, you get a free product and they get data on how it's being used to improve it. I'm completely fine with that sort of thing if it is clear from the beginning. I hate having to read terms of service to find out how much data will be collected on me. If I'm paying for a product then I expect that privacy, if it's free I assume data collection will happen but I like to think it won't be too intrusive. But when I read things like this:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't like how vague it is, &quot;other sources&quot; could be practically anything.</p>
<p>Thankfully, in this case, Microsoft didn't have a gigantic legal wall of text. It was rather clear and concise. So some points to them for not burying it in legal jargon.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it's pretty nice. The git integration is neat. It also has autocomplete that's better than most text editors (not IDE). But it's still very young and crashes occasionally on Ubuntu, so I'm still sticking with Atom.</p></div>
