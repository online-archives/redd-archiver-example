    <div class="md"><p>Don't forget the other India gem: culture.</p>
<p>If anyone in the outsourced group does something wrong, they all circle the wagons to defend them, lie about it, misrepresent the situation and blame anyone but themselves for the mistake.  That includes taking responsibility for <em>fixing</em> the mistake.</p>
<p>Also, finally, the explanation barrier.  Good luck knowing if they understood anything you said because they will always say they do and then expect to be paid for not actually understanding anything before spending multiple days doing it wrong because they didn't understand <em>at all</em> but didn't want to admit it or even hint that they didn't understand by asking questions.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've worked for 4 companies that used india companies as outsourced resources. Not only do they suck as code writing they aren't much cheaper. In the long run, they are much much more expensive. </p>
<p>If you look at the economics of hiring an india company, they lure you with the idea of getting more for less so each developer is worth 1/3 the cost, so you can afford to throw 3-4 times as many people for the cost of american developers. Thats what they sell executives on. </p>
<p>However, they take about 10x the time to deliver a product, that upon code review has to be rewritten anyways. All four companies pretty nearly went bankrupt saving all that money because they were sued by their real clients who had to accept the shitty code that doesn't work. </p>
<p>I literally remember looking through code where there were supposed to be work queues and couldnt figure out how it was working. The truth, it was never written, but they claimed it was. Whenever they did a demo for our internal team, they had some guy in india, manually triggering the process code, but they claimed it was the work queue system they spent 5 weeks implementing.</p></div>
