<p>Edit build and add <code>chat</code> to one line.<br />
The edit init and add <code>startChat();</code> to one line.</p>
<p>Then run it. All of what you see is something you can make just by editing the global item, and anyone can incorporate it. No back end development.  You could build anything.  A youtube, a Voat.  Anyone can edit any application just by re-declaring one function and adding their username to the build.</p>
<p>I couldn't censor you if I wanted to because not only can I not control what data is on an application, I can't even control what kind of applications are on it and how you rebuild them.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I need to make it easier for users to read each other's code though, because that's kind of the point.</p>
<p>Here is the chat client's code, for reference if you want to change any function in your globals:<br />
<a href="https://pastebin.com/Q5gynyUT">https://pastebin.com/Q5gynyUT</a> <br />
Here is the chat server's code (run's front end):<br />
 <a href="https://pastebin.com/W06L3J6y">https://pastebin.com/W06L3J6y</a>  
</p>
<p>It could be built far more serverless (no front end server peers) but this is what I wrote in two hours as a demo.</p>
<p>If it doesn't run the server probably needs to be run.<br />
user:chat-server<br />
pass:chat-server<br />
and run it.  I have the code backed up in case someone fucks with it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That's really cool. Lately I got really interested in programming. Accidently found a <a href="https://clockwise.software/">Clockwise Software</a> application development  company's blog, read a few articles and after that started taking Udemy cources, hanging out more with my friends who are invilved in IT and the whole thing is fascinating to me. I'd love to become a developer some day but sadly, it won't be soon. I see how much info I need to consume and how many things I need to learn and it seems nearly impossible at this point.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I've definitely made some improvements.  There is now an #import statement.  The key is to not mind using more than one user.</p>
<p>I just need to set it up so you can browse other user's code.  If you check back in a bit there will be a links panel to the left that will help you find things to import from and faq and other things.  Right now the getscript user is good to pull from.  It allows you to pull any script off the web and include it in your project with a callback once it's loaded.</p>
<pre><code>#import getscript
function start () {
 //Import pdf.js
 getscript('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pdf.js/2.0.943/pdf.min.js',()=&gt;{
  //some code
 });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Also getscript<em>s</em> takes an array of urls and is inside the getscript user.</p>
<p>The monaco user lets you insert a highly capable text editor into the browser.</p>
<p>You can see it at work by putting <code>notebook</code> in your build and running <code>startNotebook()</code> in the init.</p>
<p>Also monaco is the text editor you see when you edit code.</p></div>
