<p>That is so true. Time after time I see analyst and project mangers come up with yet another hype word and they actually think that that will safe the project. It didn't save it last time and the new hype words are not going to save the new project.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Best advice: skip ITT. You are better off taking free courses at coursera. I would provide link but Voat is being buggy on my phone.</p>
<p>Coursera offers basic to advanced coding classes, as does codeacademy. Go to community college or find a University that offers a distance learning program if you need a degree.</p>
<p>Also, prepare yourself for a couple shitty jobs if you don't go the 4-year university route. Unless you attend a university that attracts recruiters, you will end up with your first job or two being crappy before you build the knowledge and reputation to apply to a place like the NSA.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, skip the for-profit universities. You will be unable to get a job interview with them on your resume. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>A caveat, if you do go to for-profit universities – which I did, like an idiot – you can still be successful but the college experience will be just that. An experience that is hardly relevant to entering the workforce. I got a job right out of college by spending a lot of time on my portfolio after college and having killer interview skills by doing mock interviews. Also freelancing for dirt cheap to get that <em>needed experience to land an entry-level job</em>.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Figure out your motivation. You'll never get far if you just want &quot;to program&quot; without any real goal in sight. <em>Why</em> do you want to program? What do you want to build?</p>
<p>Get a grip of the basic concepts. Programming is like mathematics, in that every step builds from the last step. Start out with simple procedural programming - there are many suitable languages, I'd suggest starting with C (if you have access to a Linux machine) or Javascript (there are <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">some great tutorials</a> that run just in your web browser), and then moving on to either C++ or .NET. Other people will suggest starting with Python, Java or similar more 'modern' languages but IMO these languages require you to understand a lot of pretty advanced concepts in order to properly know what's going on.</p>
<p>Don't put too much store in coursework. Pick a project and work on it. When you're done, think about what went well, what didn't go well. Which bits of your project are solid and reliable, which bits make you feel a bit uneasy. Go back and fix up anything that you're not happy with. Spend some time polishing your project. Then pick another project and work on that. Don't be afraid to fail - the only way to fail at programming is by giving up. The internet has an almost unlimited amount of knowledge readily available if you need it.</p>
<p>If you want project ideas, once you're past the Javascript tutorial phase I'd suggest a series of small apps and games:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Hello World': Gets you started. You'll be able to compile and run a trivial program.</li>
<li>'Guess the number from 1 to 100' text game: Gets you started with conditional statements (if/then), loops, text input and output.</li>
<li>Mandelbrot Set picture generator: Gets you started with graphics output, windowing, event handling and more looping.</li>
<li>Tetris: More advanced graphics, keyboard input, interactive real-time programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon you'll have project ideas popping into your head all the time. The hard bit will be choosing which ones to do!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've always thought starting with high level languages like Python is the wrong way to go. I think it is much more beneficial to start with simple C programs, or even bare and basic assembly, so you can start off learning what your computer is actually doing. Having this fundamental understanding of what the chip does really helps shape your world view when you start moving to other, higher level languages.</p>
<p>If all the nitty gritty is abstracted away right from the beginning, you never get a chance to learn the nitty gritty.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>OP said he wants to learn Programming, he didn't specifically say he wants to learn Computer Science. There is a significant difference between the two professions. I'm just recommending Python because it's the easiest general purpose language.</p>
<p>The problem with the &quot;starting low level&quot; approach is that it requires a level of knowledge / skill / theory a newbie just does not have.</p>
<p>Assembly is archaic and a strong foundation of Computer Science theory is a prerequisite to understanding what is going on. Also the barrier to entry is high in that the student needs to learn how to use the tools first before he can actually start programming.</p>
<p>The idea with starting with Python is the student can learn what a IF statement is TODAY with minimal barrier to entry. These concepts are pretty much universal. <strong>If</strong> and <strong>when</strong> OP needs to move on to other languages, he can.</p>
<p>Learning low language concepts is a good goal, but it might not ever be necessary. Probably wont ever be necessary for 99% of developers. This is something that should be worked toward as a goal, not a starting point.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Learning the IF conditonal is a terrible idea if the programmer doesn't know where the whole idea of an IF statement comes from. It's easy to forget but the conventions we accept as normal in programming exist because of the way the machine physically works. I've had to clean up a lot of code because previous programmers knew how to do something, but not why you do it. For better or worse, you need to start at the bottom. Programmers that start at the top are the bane of my existence because they almost always are the ones that are the most confident and the ones that most need cleaning up after.</p></div>

<p>If all the nitty gritty is abstracted away right from the beginning...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is for a good reason. Without context, knowing the nitty gritty details of computer science isn't going to be easy or even really helpful. The reason its almost universally suggested to start with higher level language is that, at the beginning, the most important thing is to get a new programmer thinking like a programmer. Overwhelming them with low level complexities (again, without any context as to why the information matters) is a good way to discourage people early.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to be a programmer, start programming. This is one field where you can absolutely teach yourself. The career is in high-demand and employers are looking for tangible skills and experiences over college degrees. A college degree is still a great thing, but I think it is a small piece of the pie. It takes a certain personality, passion and dedication to make it as a programmer. The career is not just about programming, but involves many unique challenges. The best way to find out if you want to be a programmer is to program. The best way to learn how to program is to program. The best way to get a job programming is to program first. Get out there, explore, and have fun!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Every time this question comes up my response is always the same: You don't learn how to program; you learn how to solve problems.</p>
<p>IOW unless you have a particular problem -- AKA project -- in mind you'll never learn how to program.</p>
<p>The Towers of Hanoi is a good one to start with. Or research the many sorting algorithms and pick one of them to implement.  These are relatively easy projects but require you to learn the basics of variables, operators, and input/output to implement them.  And from there you build on your skills with more complex projects.</p>
<p>Otherwise just trying to learn syntax is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Being a programmer is also about picking which set of tools -- language, platform, etc -- is the best for the job at hand, but that comes later.  So to start off pick a problem and a language and off you go.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I find what you're asking to be the hardest part of programming.  Once you can pretty much do anything, what the heck do you do?  Best answers I've seen is pick something you're already interested in, find a way to start programming.  Or, you can find an open source project, join the community, and learn through your contributions there.  
</p>
<p>I work with tech (but not specifically application dev,) so I try to script little things, or write small programs to help track daily tasks or whatever.  Programming is an endless bottomless pit, so you have to have an outside interest to attach it to or you can just spall around forever picking up bits and pieces and never actually accomplishing anything. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, as a visual learner, the best way to learn programming was through video games because there's so much instant payoff. There are thousands of thorough tutorials on game programming for flash or unity, and they teach you the basics pretty fast. My
Advice is to get unity (free) and see if you can get a box to move when you click the mouse button. Anybody with any minimal level if tenacity ought to be able to figure out how to
do that with only free online resources in a weekend. Then you move on to creating and destroying boxes depending on where you click and let your enthusiasm drive you. Once you can look at code without it looking like Sanskrit, you can leverage that knowledge to accelerate your path towards whatever sub-discipline or career path you like.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Sift through <a href="/v/moocs">/v/moocs</a> , <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a>. Read as much as you can, take basic courses of c,c++,python,html,css. The main thing about coding or programming is, when you feel your good at something or you finally know it, try to do do something out of your comfort zone, you then will realize that there is much more to be learned. Never assume your on top in any language. Coding and programming is a long never ending process, new tech,apps,programs, ect. whatever you want to call it will always be advancing. I would also recommend learning different OS (operating systems) windows,linux,mac,android, open sources. Good luck - from Knifemare </p></div>
