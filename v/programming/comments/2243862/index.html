<p>I was looking at Christmas gifts and found a bunch of STEM learning toys that even I was tempted to buy for myself. That lead me into looking at engineering and programming games, when I found CodeCombat. I think it's an awesome idea, like a beefed up Karl the Robot. Teaches general programming in multiple languages, with a few sections for Web Design and Game Design. </p>
<p>Going through it now and it's helped me with a few things, still struggle with some pretty basic concepts. But it's also a bit too much like CodeCademy, where I can copy/paste too much code. Hopefully it gets a bit more on your own later on. Still a cool way to teach the concepts to future programmers.</p>
<p>Anyone have experience with teaching material like this? Also looking for something to help understand electrical engineering and robotics in a more controlled environment (can't fry components with fuck-ups)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You might also be interested in Codingame.com, it has more serious challenges and assumes you know the basics of the language that you will be using.</p>
<p>Also check out the games by Zachtronics.  They are usually pretty cheap on steam and they are excellent learning tools.  I've spent a fair bit of time in TIS-100, but their new game Shenzen-I/O is supposed to be even better.</p></div>
