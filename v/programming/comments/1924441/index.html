    <div class="md"><p>I typically learn well when I have a specific goal, build X, or write a program that does Y. First it's motivating and second it forces you do deal with real life problems and not just skim around less interesting parts that are actually important. </p>
<p>Pick a program that you would like to write. Make sure it's not too complex but still useful or interesting. It can be command line based (e.g. you type stuff in or get print outs), graphical or even mobile (e.g. android).  For example, a 4 operation calculator.</p>
<p>BTW, Pascal is a great language but not as popular this days, but there are many other languages that you can find for free on the internet, including nice IDEs that make things easier.</p>
<p>If you are open for other forms of programming, I highly recommend OpenScad.  It's a simple language that allow you to construct 3D objects and if you have a 3D printer (you can find cheap ones) you can actually print it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you interested in making? If you are on linux you can make little shell scripts that accomplish a lot and can be chained together for even more complex behavior.</p>
<p>If you are interested in making web pages you can start playing around with javascript and html. It's easy to start, lots of tools and guides to use, and you can see output right away. Use <a href="http://jsbin.com">http://jsbin.com</a> or something like codepen to try out code very quickly. I like these tools because you can include js libraries like jquery or angular with 1 click, no complicated setup just to start.</p>
<p>Are you wanting to make games, start some C or C++ tutorials. Are you intersted in home electronics projects? Learn about embedded systems, and get something like an arduino and learn the language to program it. </p>
<p>So many options for programming these days.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Don't believe people who tell you you're using the wrong language. Programming languages are something people fight over now, like football and religion.</p>
<p>I recommend you download <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a> and begin with <a href="https://emacs-doctor.com/learn-emacs-lisp-in-15-minutes.html">Emacs Lisp</a>. You can get a handle on the language in less than a day, and learn enough of its libraries to customize Emacs to your liking in under a week. </p>
<p>At that point you'll have a programmers text editor configured to your liking and you'll have a handle on fundamental programming concepts which apply to any language. You'll also have formed some opinions on Lisp, and whether you'd like to continue with it or switch to something else.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you dont understand the basics all your code will be a pile of shit to work on regardless of what language you write it in. Programmers that cant build a maintainable piece of software are a dime a dozen mostly people who only learned &quot;functional&quot; programming. You can spot them quickly because there code is an amorphous blob of repeated code lacking any structure. They couldn't define a domain boundary and form an interface for abstraction to save their life. Once the goal of their code becomes more than trivial the ability for anyone to come through and refactor or add features is entirely determined by how quickly they can convince management to throw it in the garbage re collect requirements and break it up into a properly structured and layered set of libraries each with their own set of responsibilities and composed behavior.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'd recommend Python as a good language to dabble with; Python is interpreted but very powerful, and a number of practical projects have been written in that language.</p>
<p>One way to teach yourself is to examine open-source programs that do things you're interested in, and alter their behavior.  You may want to find out what programs you're currently using are open source and think about how you'd want to improve them.</p>
<p>All that having been said, basic programming is pretty basic, but real computer science is a branch of mathematics.  To be a good programmer you need to have a good grounding in math up through algebra at least and trig for a lot of it.  You'll also need to study some general techniques programmers use; pick up some books on data structures and algorithms.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You might consider getting a Cozmo. It's a small robot that has an active development community and a really vibrant and approachable SDK. </p>
<p>The scripting language it uses is Python, which is a popular starting language and is also used for lots of real things. </p>
<p>I know it involves buying a product, but on the flip side, you get to see your software operating a real live robot even with a few-line example. The SDK offers very high level functions, but mid- and low-level ones too. If you wanted to dive &quot;deep enough&quot;, you could even pipe the raw data from all Cozmo's sensors into an app on the desktop and get really crazy with it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>You also might consider getting Xcode and learning Swift with Playgrounds. They build-and-run as you type, which is very flexible and easy to use. There are WWDC videos out that show you how to develop and inspect an algorithm using playgrounds, before you place it in your production code. </p>
<p>Playgrounds also allow apple's sample code in their e-books to be live and editable, which makes them a fun read. </p>
<p>Swift is a modern language that offers some FP styled concepts and a modern object oriented system, and the toolchains are available for at least linux and mac, but I think for windows too. So, Swift is a good language to pick up to get to grips with modern architectures. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Algorithms and finding a personal task/use. I also started with Karl the Robot. Simple commands to navigate complex scenarios. Algorithms help teach how to break up large problems into small steps. That's a really helpful skill. Too many try to program too much all at once instant of one tiny part, make sure it works, then move onto the next tiny part. That way, when it comes back with errors you know exactly what part isn't working instead of hunting for hours. </p></div>

Javascript is always useful to know because it's the number one programming language in the world.

    <div class="md"><p>If you have Microsoft Office you probably have a version of Visual Basic already available to you. I'd suggest starting by learning how to write functions and macros in Excel. You'll find this particularly easy if you start by learning how to record macros, as you can then inspect the code afterwards. There's also a great deal of satisfaction in writing your first function in Excel. Drop me a line if you want to know more (though my response time may be slow, as I don't log on here much). Good luck.</p></div>
