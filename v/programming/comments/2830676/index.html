    <div class="md"><p>I don't know whether Terry was MK Ultra, naturally crazy, a blackmailed patsy or any other situation...</p>
<p>I think some of the rants are reactive to something that isn't always obvious in video. I think the resentment against &quot;M.I.T. Niggers&quot; could be from an MIT student leaving a rude comment on a previous video. I wouldn't know but that is what I think after watching the video above.</p>
<p>Various rants and insights in both videos, many of which may well be correct or at least half right.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless you plan on going into research very few CS classes beyond the intro stuff will actually teach you anything particularly useful, and I think most people leave school severely lacking in experience working on large projects, managing complexity, etc. Things that you get a feel for just doing shit like writing something like templeos, so I do see his point. </p>
<p>Plus you add the geneds that even CS majors have to take and yeah it just doesn't add up.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>From my experience prior to 2000, I can say that he is (or was back then) specifically incorrect in calling out MIT.   The vast majority of Universities did not prepare students for industry, but MIT was one of the ones that actually did it.
Terry seems like he was a knowledgeable autodidact, but he greatly overestimated his own skill.   In particular, software is not written in a vacuum and so you must work with other people and their code, something that Terry was unable to do.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>All developer that came out of school the last 5 years and learned to program are fucked up. They have been brainwashed &quot;how to think&quot; and create crappy projects, they never learned to think for themselves and invent new ways to nail down your project.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that they are not even aware how badly they suck. The proof will be in the pudding because 5 years down the road they  will lose their job as a developer because they are still stuck to the ways they were brainwashed. It is almost impossible to unlearn your bad behavior in software.</p>
<p>Modern developers have lost the ability to think in multiple dimensions. All they have learned is paint by numbers and one dimensional thinking.</p></div>
