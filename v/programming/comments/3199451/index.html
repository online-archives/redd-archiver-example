<p>So, you have a husband who is a programmer working for $50 an hour, the wife is able to make more than him because she got a job the pays normal rates. Basically that’s $100+ per hour that Americans are loosing.</p>
<p>Also, consider this, these jobs that spouses do can easily filled by Americans and these jobs lead to management positions.</p>
<p>Companies like TCS (India’s Tata) will focus on hiring programmers because they fear dumping charges. Yet, when you ask them about manager positions they basically say they don’t have any. Of course not! They filled them with Indian Nationals.</p>
<p>Another trick is that recruiting companies are largely based off shore with branches set up in the US for appearance sakes. They also act as huge out sourcing operations.</p>
<p>TCS has a huge campus the size of google in India which was more than likely built with profits made in the US.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it's because managers don't trust American workers. This is a management issue. The companies know you are there, they don't care. They're going to get rid of that programmer the second they are done, by any means necessary to save money. They don't want to face you when they do it. They promise big to get the talent, then screw you a year later with excuses about saving money. H1B makes it so they don't have to face the social consequence of their shitty actions. It's not you, it's them.</p>
<p>I've seen this enough times personally to know this is the reality. It has everything to do with money and social consequences, nothing to do with being able to find talent.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience they aren't even cheaper than hiring citizens. We've worked with many H1B coders, who were fucking terrible (admitted to having friends take their coding tests), that were paid as much or more than mid-level developers. They were hired to do tasks we didn't want to bother having our juniors work on, so not like we were hiring them for things we couldn't' handle.  Doesn't make sense unless someone is getting their pockets lined.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this. What I have experienced is that they get more people on the project, by a ratio of 1 to 3. If you need 1 US programmer, you will get 3 off shore resources. Because on paper, 3 is still cheaper than 1 US programmer. </p>
<p>But these 3 take 10x longer to find a solution, and you have to rewrite a lot of their work anyways. I'm working with a team now thats been working for 6 months on a solution, that took me and one other person less than a couple weeks to complete. </p>
<p>Another nasty trend I am seeing is that senior managers are also H1B so who do they hire? More H1B's from overseas companies. </p>
<p>Even 5-8 years ago, a team was made up of less than 30-40% of H1B or off shore resources. Now I'm seeing the opposite. Less than 20% of the team is US programmers and 80% H1B or off shore resources.</p></div>

<p>Meanwhile all the leader-caste in India has abandoned their traditional duties and roles and is just farming money in American so they can retire and live like Rajahs back in the motherland.  It's fucking hilarious.</p>
