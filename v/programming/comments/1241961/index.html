    <div class="md"><p>I think neural networks would be great to do such a thing since it can learn and adapt. It is a low scale attack so big companies won't notice that their data is slowly turning into useless data. So it is not a massive flood of the data but a very slow crawling. I think the AI could learn by trial and error, and learn to outsmart big company  AI's.</p>
<p>Maybe the AI could even generate a fake ID for you. Maybe convince Bing that you are Robert Redford.</p>
<p>Imagine that the AI also generate new photo's and upload them to new online profiles. The neural network AI's now in use really does not interpret images, but you can generate images with fake profile photo's that would fool a face detection AI (but not a human)</p>
<p>The key here is that is is a slow process, to go unnoticed. Slow gradual changes.</p></div>

<p>Deviations of the norm put you on a list.
Good point, and considering this actually makes the solution easier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How viable would it be to collect other's habits ( say view most popular videos etc...) and generate searches for those and related content ?</p>
<p>Should be easier than coming up with a random &quot;normal&quot; search pattern, and would be more likelly to look normal because it's a copy.</p></div>

<p>Instead of removing your own data, why not 'pollute' the entire data stream. How? Perhaps this could take the form a browser extension which, you would activate or set a frequency whereby it would make random searches, go to random sites, etc.</p>
<p>Or perhaps there are better ways to do this. </p>
<p>I just imagine that social networking data 'customers' start finding that their data is shit, it's going cause havok. </p></div>

<p>The more bad data the better. What is this &quot;just small enough&quot; stuff, I want a SETI@HOME crowd soruced marketing disinformation campaign. </p>
