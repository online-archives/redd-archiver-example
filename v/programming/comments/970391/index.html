<p>so i graduated from college recently and have been looking for a job for about a month or more now. I have been submitting applications through various online job searching sites but have not gotten much response back from them. I've gone to my school job fair and have gotten interviews from those but only the first part and have no clue if they went well or if i just think they went well myself. I have yet to get a second interview so i don't know what goes on with that part as well. Not really sure what most companies are looking for in interviews. </p></div>

<p>Try to apply directly on companies' sites if possible. Sometimes it's just more reliable or opens more doors. Keep changing your resume to highlight different skills, or have a few different ones based on what type of position you're looking for (one for web backend, one for web frontend, one for other programming). Also take this time do anything to enhance your resume and skills, like mock interviews or personal projects or getting certificates.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>A good place to start might be with your college's alumnus resources department. The department computer science in was at your university might also have job placement assistance available. Go check their office. Another good resource are your friends and acquaintances from college. Especially in today's job market who you know is in many ways more important than what you know. Aside from all of that setup a site and host some projects demonstrating your skills.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/user/captbrogers">/u/captbrogers</a> already mentioned one part but I'm replying here so you'll see it...</p>
<p>Definitely look into area user groups (MeetUp usually has a bunch). This is an amazing place to network. There will be recruiters. There will be hiring managers there that are networking. There will also be other devs there who may just happen to know about open positions at their companies. I've even seen people advertise open positions at their employer during these meetings. Worst case, you'll learn about something new/cool if it's a good group. </p>
<p>Just being at that group can give you a foot in the door. You're spending your free time learning more about development, and that's a good thing to see in a potential hire. Also, there's nothing wrong with going through a recruiter to get a job. It can be kind of annoying at times but it's a lot better than being unemployed. If you do that go route, make sure you work with a technical recruiter. A generic one is going to be absolutely useless at finding you jobs you're qualified for or would be interested in. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Start applying for jobs that you know you aren't completely qualified for as well - sometimes that will get HR's attention as they move it over to the correct bin and they'll contact you merely for showing initiative. If you're lucky, they'll run it by the manager of the department that you'll (hopefully) end up working for and they'll contact you directly.</p>
<p>Another thing that you should do if you haven't already is start ignoring the minimum experience bit in the requirements, because even HR knows that that's an impractical requirement for an entry-level position. If it asks for 5 years experience and they bring it up in the interview, simply state that you naturally assumed your college experience would count towards that, because otherwise why would they want minimum experience?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I work at a software company, the only way you're going to be hired as &quot;a developer&quot; there is if you have experience. But, I started out doing customer help desk a couple years ago for $12/hour with no experience and I was promoted from support to QA, to developer, and then to architect. We have two other developers and two QA currently who moved up from support. That probably only works at certain companies though, if you're working at a call center for a huge company it's going to be harder to get noticed. My company is small-ish (50 or so employees), big enough to be able to actually pay salary but small enough that I talk with the CTO every day.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>30-year programmer here. Knowing an industry and understanding how to build tools that support that industry are the two most important things, so find an industry you'd like to work in for the rest of your life, and start focusing from there. LEARN EVERYTHING YOU CAN about that industry. Finance, manufacturing, healthcare, gaming are all different and require different mindsets and capabilities. While the basic tools may be the same (algorithms, data structures, flow control, etc.) what will really set you apart is your knowledge of the industry itself. I work in healthcare, and to be a solid programmer in healthcare you have to learn and master a staggering amount of medical knowledge; you have to know your nephron from your glomerulus and why they are important. </p>
<p>Even within healthcare, the programming and required industry knowledge will be different depending on whether you're developing clinical tools, financial tools, performance monitoring programs, HR, engineering support applications, etc. etc. Pick a path and become an expert that can program effectively to support that operation. </p>
<p>When I hire junior programmers I look for four things:  the ability to think analytically, an in-depth understand of clinical care delivery, basic programming skills, and the ability to learn anything they need to learn BY THEMSELVES. Analytical thinking and self learning are most important.</p>
<p>And one more thing: I don't give a flying crap about degree programs or certs. They are essentially meaningless in the real world. School taught you how to use saws and nailguns, it didn't teach you how to build houses. Now you have to learn how to build a house. The tools will come in handy.</p>
<p>So, my advice would be to stop thinking of yourself as a programmer and start becoming an expert in some industry. An expert that can program to support that industry's operations.</p></div>
