    <div class="md"><p>I'm old school IT, 35 years. I had to look up Agile. Regardless of what process you follow I would add the following that I've discovered over the years. I also think this applies to any industry or profession. 80% of the work product is produced by 20% of the people. The 80% are largely dead weight and get in the way of productive work and cause problems. One of the reasons I think Apple was so successful for as long as they were is that the 80% were regularly culled from the work force. </p></div>

<p>That fits my observation. I have noticed that when Agile fails they add more people, but then it fails even harder. These managers now start to panic and try to control the project even harder, but kills off any good developer. </p></div>

<ul>
<li>As always with the software engineering methodology du jour, it's seen by non-technical management as a silver bullet that lets you build software with unskilled staff, so they hire cheap, submissive developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seriously, I've been in Agile teams and it freaking rocked. I've been in other Agile teams and it sucked donkey bollocks. It all comes down to the people in the team.</p></div>

<p>At my company we have 3 types of developers.  Leaders, Architects, &amp; Developers.  Everyone starts as a Developer and you hope they can progress to Architect at the very least.  Some come with leadership skills at entry level, but those are rare.  Leadership skills can be cultivated by the environment of the company which starts with good mentoring.</p></div>

In other words Agile fails because development organisations fail to commit to the methodology, and try to keep a waterfall approach in management while letting the project participants to be &quot;Agile&quot;.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This is wrong.  This is the opinion of either a good developer who has been working with low quality developers, or a good developer who has been working under poor quality leadership and mentoring.  I run a software department and recently transitioned from Waterfall to Agile.  It took us 3 years to fully get to test driven as well.

    <div class="md"><p>Agile is good for projects that by their nature contain many small objects that can be developed, debugged or even completely rewritten in short time frames. Web page and web site development can be examples. </p>
<p>Waterfall is better suited to projects where there are many large components that need to interface with other large systems, or projects with complex regulatory compliance needs, or complicated business rules. These projects often sit behind waterfall projects, such as data stores, OLTP databases, HR systems, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that Agile has become the new hot answer to all that ails development, so it is being used where it is inappropriate. It's like trying to use a hot new Tesla for your mass transit route because it is the cool new thing , when you really still need a bus. </p></div>
