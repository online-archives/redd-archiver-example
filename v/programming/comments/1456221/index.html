<p>Is this freedom to choose and decide really free? Or just an &quot;illusion&quot; like Religious free will.</p>
<p>So these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I choose what agile team I want to be in? I want to work for Team A because this is a team that has a higher success rate which is good for my career.</li>
<li>Can the team choose what SCRUM master or even product owner it wants to work with? Can the team refuse SCRUM master B because he is an complete idiot with a continuous stream of failed projects?</li>
<li>Can a team demand this current SCRUM master to be replaced because he is more interested in his charts than this team?</li>
<li>Can the team to slow down next sprint jobs so that burn down graph is always positive and less depressing?</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the team really has all the power or just a big &quot;illusion&quot; to keep them under control?</p></div>
