    <div class="md"><p>Much better advice: use as much existing code as possible. Most of the time this involves frameworks, because frameworks are attempts at generalizing existing code for a wider set of purposes. Are all frameworks well-designed? no. Are they a pain to use or learn at times? yes. Are they they still worth it, for any significantly large project they are.</p>
<p>Any code is only as good as the support for it. Any time you home-roll your own solution in order for it to really remain a solution for anything it needs to be supported. If you're running a business that means employing more people. If you're writing code alone or in a small team, it puts more responsibility on your shoulders to maintain and slows down your development.</p>
<p>This argument that people who use frameworks don't even understand how computers work is so silly. It's a good thing they don't. Productivity comes from specialization, if you're building project there's probably some small seed of originality in it which makes it worth writing, everything else is just boilerplate. If you choose to write the boilerplate yourself you're probably an autistic idiot.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>And therein is the problem. Frameworks led to making programming a simple routine of mediocrity. No one is truly innovating in software and programming any more. The browser has become legacy and needs to be retired. JS should never have become a first class language. These things are holding us back now and yet people still believe they are the future. Native mobile apps have to fill in the gaps where web applications fail because the browser and security sandbox restrict our capabilities, but native apps are just as much a problem to innovation. We need something new and powerful that breaks through the limitations of the browser while providing a safe and secure application delivery platform. And before you say &quot;Web Assembly&quot;- NO! Just NO! We don't need another disjointed layer of crap on top of the browser to make up for its shortcomings. We need something new and frameworks aren't going to get us there.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>A simple corporate crud form doesn't need to innovate everything. A browser application helps make sure that everyone is using the latest version of your software. Building something simple from scratch is pointless and inefficient. Using a framework makes code easier to read and understand and can radically reduce technical debt, if done properly. Sometimes you need to reinvent the wheel, usually a standardl wheel works just fine and saves time.</p></div>

<p>With that logic the browser should never have been built. Frameworks would also not have been built. You are free to program as you wish but don't call people idiots for not liking frameworks and giving valid reasons for it.</p>
<p>And before you get all- but, but browsers are not simple- the first one was.</p></div>

<p>I think you lost your imagination and have forgotten how great software can be written. Everything looks like a nail if you only have a hammer. </p>
<p>I bet that every time  you get a new project the first thing you do is clone your project, rename it, change font and there is your new project. I am sorry an Indian freshman ath half your price just from school can also create a CRUD project.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, sure. They also have intimate knowledge of interbase, Oracle, product center, SQL, various proprietary data wrappers, years of understanding how corporate systems and databases interact with each other and when/why data needs to be replicated where. A team of Indian programmers could do my job for what I make, it'd probably cost the company millions after they corrupt a database, but they could do it.</p>
<p>None of which changes the fact that a crud application that touches 4 databases is just a crud application and is easy as shit to write in angular/.net</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>And you've never run into the database that the engineer built who decided that the 20 letter long sku needs to be the primary key, and they need a second key, just because. And another engineer added tables with a different naming schema 2 years later then nobody used foreign keys for anything,just common names and SKUs and of course they did it in access so when someone goes to look up data the 14 tools they wrote(then lost all the source code, of course) in VBA stop working and catastrophe. </p>
<p>And my favorite. Anytime anyone wanted data they wrote a brand new sketchy view, so there are 20 views for the same table, 10 of which query the same fields in different orders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I somewhat agree with this.</p>
<p>I think new programmers should take the time to learn the underlying tech that frameworks try to simplify.  This will give you a better understanding of the lower level stuff and make you a better programmer in the long run. Building your own framework, even if it's only purpose is to learn how, is a worthwhile experience.</p>
<p>However, learning to use a framework or two is not a bad idea.  Bottom line: People need jobs.  Even if you are a &quot;script kiddy&quot; who gets replaced after a year or two, you still got a couple years of employment out of it.</p>
<p>Interesting note:  In my former job, I was in on most of the programmer interviews. It amazes me how many programmers (not just entry level ones....) have NO IDEA how computers work.</p></div>

<p>I do agree with this. Staying away from it does not mean that you are not allowed to use one to see how it works and pass a HR exam. But too many times I have seen that the framework causes more problems than they solve.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points all. It won't convince any programmers who are balls-deep in the framework fantasy though. Since most of these coders were introduced to frameworks at the beginning of their careers, the likelihood of them accepting that there are other ways is quite small since they have formed their opinions on frameworks based on that start (and some rockstar programmer they idolize). One thing I've learned over my decades of programming all manner of systems is that the script kiddies are numerous and willfully ignorant to change. The browser as an application platform with HTML, CSS and JS sticking around for as long as it has shows this. We could have built a better application delivery platform by now if there weren't so many green programmers against it. They champion Open Source and denigrate proprietary software but it is obvious we're not really improving and innovating with FOSS like we were under closed source. There no longer is incentive to mature technologies because everything has become a popularity contest now. New frameworks are released all the time which <a href="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png">just meet someone else's edge case or niche use</a> or worse yet, are some gap-fill to the inadequacy of another framework. We could have fixed all this but the browser brand wars and fanboys were too numerous to see the real problems. We could have a true application delivery platform that would free up the browser to be about content and also eliminate the installed app ecosystem that is making all platforms a mess. We ended up here because of the script kiddies wanting to continue on with the jQuery, Angular, Bootstrap, etc. game where everything is sad and similar instead of making something new and bad ass. I've grown tired of web applications that are nothing more than social, video, maps, messaging and micro-transaction mashups. They have run their course and are no longer interesting to anyone outside of narcissistic attention whores. Let's get back to building cool things with new technologies that aren't refried frameworks and platforms. Let's make programming great again.</p></div>
