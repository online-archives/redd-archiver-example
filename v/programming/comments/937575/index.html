    <div class="md"><p>So any gui since even the old days involves incorporating a gui library.  Most of them are language portable.  I suggest gtk or wx-widgets.</p>
<p>The downside, they take time to learn and master.  It's more tedius than difficult.  They don't give you much control over astetics.  They implant inportability in your code.</p>
<p>This is why a lot of games go with a custom gui.  You have to do graphics anyway, you would like control over astetics, it looks more professional.</p>
<p>Here is my suggestion.  Go with gtk or wx but don't put a lot of time into making the game's outer gui perfect.  Focus on the game itself and get a basic ui up even if cluncky.  This gives you time to weight where you will really go without putting too much investment into it.</p>
<p>Best yet, if you want to find a VC for the game (probably not but it's never bad to build workflows that incorporate that into muscle memory), then they will care more about if the game is playable.  Think Doom.  The menu was so basic they could have coded that in a day.  A VC would get that and you could have that dock nothing from your valuation if your ui just needs a little work.  The real question for them, or anyone you try to sell this game to whether it is a website or players, is if the game is fun.</p>
<p>td;dr: You have some options.  Don't over think the UI till the end.  gtk or wx should cover you to make the game testable.  Focus on the game mechanics and graphics.  Take this time to verify that you can do what you want with ui to double check that you won't get hung up on it later.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I used PyGame to make a game long time ago.
Very good platform, simple and bug-free. Highly recommend.</p>
<p>My only reservation for what you asked is that it does not come with a library for buttons, dials, etc. It's not a good library if you require point an click. It's pretty good though if you want to do a simple side-scrooler.</p></div>
