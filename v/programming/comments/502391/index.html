<p>No one write fail-safe code because &quot;it's hard&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It actually is hard.  No need for quotes.  
</p>
<p>A former colleague of mine always asked me why I wrote code that failed so eagerly.  Why didn't I write code that handled errors like him?  Well, I found his manner of error handling likely to cause more problems in the long run.  Often, it could allow code to continue running after recovering from an error.  But I always worried that the internal state of the program would be changed in unexpected ways, causing unexpected results.  I prefer to bring the whole system down than <code>catch()</code> an unknown exception and just keep running, potentially hiding a real problem.  
</p>
<p>That guy was in the habit of writing <code>SafeSomething()</code> methods that did the same as <code>Something()</code>, but he claimed they would never cause a system to fail.  In fact, he was so confident, that he bet me a free lunch for every way I could find to make an application crash originate inside of those functions.</p>
<p>I got a few lunches out of it.  There are a lot of ways to crash an application beyond regular out of bounds and null reference exceptions.  Heap overflows, stack overflows, and all manner of other nastiness can strike too.  It's seriously difficult to write a system that continues to operate under <em>any</em> circumstances.  That's the domain of NASA and pacemakers.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The quotes were ambiguous. I didn't mean that they were wrong in saying that &quot;it's hard&quot; but simply that it's not a reason to give up on beautiful, resilient, and performant code. And that is especially true when you are writing low level functions that work on strings and such. I'm not talking about complex systems that &quot;just need to work&quot; because you're in a corporate environment (those are usually closed source spaghetti heaps of trashable code that nobody cares about. They're the opposite of open source contributions to Linux...).</p></div>

It's unfortunate that in most cases it's, &quot;Not in the budget.&quot; to debug code regularly. That's for company situations though.. Open source stuff you'd hope that competent dedicated people would have the drive and enthusiasm in what they were working on to not half-ass it and skim over things.</p></div>

<p>Because that's exactly how they start out a lot of the time. Someone needs some tool for something, thinks &quot;hey people might like this,&quot; and posts the source on GitHub or something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So far when I see forks being created is because they add new features and do not fix bugs that were in the old fork itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might be wrong about this, but wouldn't that be because they rely on the &quot;upstream&quot; project to be fixing the bugs and then just porting those fixes to the fork?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>But good developers don't expect others to fix their bugs. I mean if you start a project, at least do the effort to create quality code to the very end. You can't call yourself a good developer if you leave half developed mess around.</p>
<p>Also good developers create code for the none-nerd. It is designed for ease of use, not massive functionality that is half implemented. The interesting things is that when you develop for the none-nerd, you create way better code, because it is easier to use, easier to understand, easier to test and debug and way more compact. </p></div>
