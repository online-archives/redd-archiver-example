<p>I chose it, because of its popularity. That is to say, I didn't look alternatives in the first place because Github is renowned and does everything I need. I'm writing my first game and I only plan on open sourcing parts of it after release. Logically I use a private repository for this (smallest plan on Github). The tools I write to assist me in development however, are open sourced.</p>
<p>I'm going to be honest here: I'm writing these tools for myself and share them out of the kindness in my heart. If a hipster-dipshit were to throw a tantrum about something I've said, me being a #GamerGate supporter, something someone somehow affiliated with the project said/did, etc. (read: unrelated stuff), I'd stop open sourcing them.</p>
<p><strong>I will NOT deal with bullshit like <a href="https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/941">#941</a>.</strong> I've got better things to do with my time.</p>
<p>So, where should I go? I heard GitLab went down the shitter too. Here's what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>git as VCS</li>
<li>unlimited open source repositories</li>
<li>closed repositories (doesn't need to be free, just reasonably priced, see Github)</li>
<li>site about business/merit rather than progressiveness/hipster-cred</li>
</ul>
<p>I heard BitBucket is supposed to be quite good feature-wise.</p></div>

<p>If I remember correctly, you can have an unlimited amount of repositories. </p>
<p>Although, the free plan only allows you to have a certain amount of contributors in all your projects. </p>

basically they brought on someone else and are working on it. You can google source tree windows performance , bugs / freezing issues they are pretty prominent and easy to find. The general consensus is that either use something else or look for an installer for version 1.5.2 which was the last stable version for windows.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>there's really no equal alternative in terms of the GUI. thus why i suggested looking for version 1.5.2 of source tree, until atlassian fixes it. The closest second would be <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/">https://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/</a> but it's missing some functionality that sourcetree has.</p></div>

<p>I use JIRA and Confluence for work. JIRA can be a bit clunky and confusing at times, but I find Confluence very useful. All devs participate in documentation using Confluence so it's our go to. And management types use it for planning and status updates.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>When we were looking at options we were drawn to Atlassian because it was very easy to get up and running using their hosted cloud and they seemed to have a solution to cover our full workflow. Previously we used github and Basecamp, but moved to BitBucket, JIRA, and Confluence. We're a very small team, so the solution had to be easy to get running, and we didn't want the hassle of self hosting. We did look at a bunch of free issue tracking and wiki solutions, but found most of them required significant time and effort to get running. We definitely aren't giving Atlassian 5 stars but we haven't found anything better that requires less admin time.</p>
<p>That being said, I feel that JIRA can easily become a tangled mess if not very actively adminned. It's very good as an issue tracker, but very clunky and confusing when in agile scrum mode.</p>
<p>Still, it's a big improvement over our previous workflow.</p>
<p>What are you using?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a customer that used Atlassian and JIRA for similar reasons.  Their in-house talent was crap (the sort of programmers that code sql injection vulnerabilities daily or write specifications for encryption that pass the data plain text with a static &quot;special secure code&quot;.  As you might imagine there are consequences to that, and they now exist only as a thin veil between their offshore Indian devs and their pissed off customers.  I think Atlassian is used with some success to hide that fact, but I digress.  OTRS is my issue tracker of choice.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you're intentionally aiming that generalisation at me as an Atlassian user, but I can assure you there are people out there with good intentions at heart!! We are a small team of local devs that have been developing hardware and firmware solutions for the past 3 years, not a front for off-shore third world developers. We bootstrapped our startup with minimal outside investment, so our decisions on the development tools we use have an immediate and real affect on our business. Despite our steady growth, software and tool costs are still something we need to be very mindful of (both upfront and ongoing, cash and labour hours).</p>
<p>I'm not defending Atlassian to the death, I agreed that it has issues, but I think you're being a bit unfair. I'm sure there are script kiddies and shill companies using OTRS too! Are you suggesting that there is something inherent in the Atlassian workflow that promotes this sort of business practice?</p>
<p>We started with github and basecamp and out grew this, so chose Atlassian. Perhaps we will change up again in future, and maybe we can hire someone to upkeep the system as part of their duties. In any case, I'm always on the look out for improvements, so thanks for the advice on OTRS, I'll definitely take a look. :-)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I am also on the BitBucket train. I looked at about 10 other options before I chose it. So far I've been mostly impressed - </p>
<p>Choice of Git or Hg. 5 team members and unlimited repos for closed projects. Adding more members is relatively cheap in comparison to other hosted options. Integration with other Atlassian tools. </p>
<p>One thing to be aware of - there's a strange bug when you create a new, empty repo via their web interface and then try to commit to it via SourceTree (their free source control program) - it fails. I don't remember all the details, its been a while since I made a new repo, but just something to watch out for if you're new. There are workarounds to be found via google. (You could always just fork a repo with at least one commit and then just strip the history as well.)</p></div>

<p>Considering that I didn't look at competitors back when I started using Github, I don't know how they compare to each other. I want to give them a chance now.</p>
<p>BitBucket is looking quite good so far.
I just compared their blogs (first two pages).</p>
<p><strong>BitBucket:</strong> Aside from &quot;this year in review&quot; everything was technology/business related</p>
<p><strong>Github:</strong> A fair share of technology/business related posts, but in between we got: &quot;Open CoC&quot;, &quot;Support LGBT tech organizations&quot;, &quot;Diversity Partners&quot; and &quot;Celebrate Pride with GitHub&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That's because BitBucket is a part of a suite of tools made for professionals by Atlassian. They leave the hipster garbage out of it and neutrally sell products to other businesses. Which is the way it ought to be. I've used ~5 of their products and I like all of them. BitBucket included. 5 free users and unlimited repos for closed projects is amazing. No one else has anything like that. You can actually have a small team and get started on BitBucket before you've got the money to expand.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the examples that conflate the contributors words with active child abuse and actually physical harm really interesting.  Basically there are a lot of people out there who feel that opinions are equivalent to actual physical acts.  How utterly fucked up is that?</p>
<p>Certainly words <em>can</em> make people feel bad.  Physical abuse <em>does</em> make feel people bad (and sometimes maims them).  I have found this opinion again and again when talking to people about various things: they feel that beliefs/words are as harmful as physical abuse/death!  They claim these are equivalent often without even realizing it as they try to make their &quot;all important&quot; point.  Seriously I think that conflating the two is disgusting.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>For local hosting you can also look into <a href="http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html">gitolite</a>. It's somewhat barebone, and it only does hosting with relatively fine-grained permissions, though, so for anything else (issue tracking and whatnot) you'll have to rely on something else. For issue tracking you might want to look into <a href="http://www.bugseverywhere.org/">Bugs Everywhere</a>, which integrates the feature with the main code repository.</p></div>

<ul>
<li>Fix is contributed (pull request)</li>
<li>Maybe the code gets reviewed by a few people</li>
<li>Compiled, run, tested.</li>
<li>Did it fix the bug? Yes.</li>
<li>Find the contributor's twitter, facebook, etc.</li>
<li>Scroll through 6 years of Twitter history to see if the contributor has made any political statements with which I disagree</li>
<li>Reject contribution</li>
<li>Dedicate X more *man-hours to fixing the bug myself</li>
<li>Repeat</li>

<li>These people have proven time and time again that they're absolute lunatics when it comes to their ideology</li>
<li>The people behind GitHub have a similar political alignment</li>
<li>Other companies (the folks behind BitBucket for example) keep their politics out of their business. The GitHub blog is full of celebrate gay pride, help LGBT, diversity this, diversity that, look at how progressive we are. The BitBucket blog is filled with technology and business related stuff. Chances are better that they will keep it that way.</li>
