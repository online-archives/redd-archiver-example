    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I learned c# for Unity.  I know, that doesn't help with you directly, but it's not hard to pick up c#.  Boo is (as you said) an obscure language.  I don't even know if Unity really cares about it(most of the unity tutorials I saw did /not/ use Boo).</p>
<p>Anyways, here's a link to the <a href="http://protoman.net/index.php?p=bootorial/index">Bootorials</a> website.  I think it'll give a pretty decent grasp of the basics  and a bit more stuff. </p>
<p>Bonus points: Here's a reason why you might use <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/220984/why-script-in-boo.html">Boo in Unity</a>  It also lists a reason why not to use it, but let's not focus on that.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I've decided to learn both Boo and Javascript. Knowing multiple languages never hurts and Java will be useful for unrelated projects in the future. I would have never find that Bootorials sight though, so I really owe you for that.</p></div>
