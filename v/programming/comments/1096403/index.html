<p>edit: Welp, thank you very much <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming">/v/programming</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>C++ is a strongly typed language, meaning in general you need to declare the type of things (int, float, string, void) before using them.</p>
<p>Declaring a function with a return type of <code>void</code> is just a way to tell the compiler that this is a function that is not supposed to return any value. That way the compiler can potentially introduce optimizations to your code, and also warn you of cases when you would accidentally do something like <code>my_variable = function_that_returns_void();</code>. In a case like this the compiler knows <code>function_that_returns_void()</code> is not supposed to return anything (if you declared it <code>void</code> when you wrote it), and can therefore tell you the code you just wrote is invalid.</p>
<p>In the original C-language you were allowed to declare functions without declaring the return type. The compiler would then assume automatically that this function is supposed to return an integer. Today in C++ functions MUST always declare the return type in advance (unless you explicitly allow undeclared types with special compiler settings). This ensures better type safety and consistency across your code.</p>
<p>So in order to always declare the return type of all your functions, you have to declare a function that returns nothing to be of type <code>void</code>. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. If not, ask and I'll try and clarify further.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience (next to none), you use void in cases like a menu function. You output to the screen a menu and it doesn't need to send anything back to the main function. </p>
<p>There's other similar cases but generally what I've seen is that it's just when you hav a function that doesn't need to send anything back to the main.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>THE CONTENT BELOW IS REFERRING TO VOID AS A POINTER TYPE, NOT A RETURN TYPE</strong></p>
<p>Really, it's not recommend (to my knowledge) for you to ever use it.  There is lots of stuff like that in C++, there is a lot of power you are given that is easy to misuse and abuse.  Your confusion now is why most start off learning python, although I think C++ is still great to learn with.</p>
<p>Void is a pointer to ANYTHING.  You have no idea what it points to or why, and it isn't enforced as such to code.  This gives it a huge amount of power, but also a huge amount of danger.  It's easy to forget or mis-remember what a void pointer is and cause all sorts of memory issues and mistakes in your code.</p>
<p>Imagine you wanted something that pointed to a character, then an integer, then a character again.  In this case you <em>could</em> use a void pointer with casting, but you still shouldn't.  Instead you should look to redesign or figure out a system where you don't need to do that, much like how you should avoid goto or lots of nested if statements.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>As everyone already said, <code>void</code> exists simply to specify &quot;nothing&quot;. Now why you would want a function that returns nothing is mostly because of good practices. As you get more and more into programming and write bigger and bigger programs, you'll want to keep everything clean, separated and isolate responsabilities. Basically it's the S in the SOLID principles. You may also want to look up DRY just for the hell of it.</p>
<p>Those are things you should only worry about later, but when you get to them, you'll most likely end up with relatively small functions that do only one thing. Now those functions might not have to return anything, for instance an initialization function that only sets up some variables in a class or at the start of a program. This is where you'll want to plug <code>void</code> as a return type, so that the compiler does not complain and force you to return useless garbage at the end of the function.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Good testable code is code that isn't full of functions that don't have side effects. Meaning don't use a void return. But there are times where you simply don't have something to return and void covers those times. I discourage people from using a void return because it means you can't unit test the function by observing it's returned value. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In programming you can think of methods like black boxes. You don't really care what goes on inside. You just care that you put something in and then rely on something happening and occasionally getting something out. So what is the return type of a blackbox that squares a number? Probably the same type as the number or maybe a bigger version (int -&gt; long, float -&gt; double). What's the return type of a black box that makes a string lowercase? Pretty obviously a string (<em>ed:</em> assuming string immutability for the anals out there). What's the return type of a black box that displays a string to the user? In this case there's no need for a return type. You're interested in a <em>side effect</em> of the call and not the <em>result</em> of the call. So a basic return type there would be void.</p>
<p>As an interesting aside in C++ <em>cout</em> is absolutely nothing special. It's a regular old object and similarly <em>&lt;&lt;</em> is also nothing special. It's simply an overloaded operator. <em>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World.&quot;;</em> is identical to something like <em>myOutputStream.OutputString(&quot;Hello world.&quot;);</em> It's just a shorthand notation. Now trick question. What's the return type of the call <em>OutputString(...)</em> ?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hint: <a href="#s" title="cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World&quot;;              ___Is the same As___        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello &quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;World&quot;;"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer: <a href="#s" title="It's a reference to the same type of object that myOutputStream or cout are. So in the more normal notation (using single quotes here since Voat's spoiler parser seems to be touched) you could do myOutputStream.OutputString('Hello ').OutputString('world.');"></a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>you always need to return a value when doing something, it could be a value of nothing or it could be something meaningful.</p>
<p>say you have a beer bottle in your hand and want to sip it. The way you typically do that (in functions):</p>
<p>// check if beer is left in the bottle
1. You need to know if there is beer left in the bottle so you'd function by calling: isBottleEmpty(), and it would return TRUE OR FALSE 
then
2. if there is beer in it, you're worry free and you drink away by calling: drinkBeer(). You don't care about anything else except drinking so you return nothing, (void).</p></div>
