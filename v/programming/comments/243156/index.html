<p>I don't particularly know what would be a good language to start learning, nor what sorts of things that I should be aiming towards programming. I'd like to do something practical, like making tiny programs that would benefit me in my hobbies or my work (I am a speedrunner, so I could try to do stuff that would help in that. I also work as a translator, so I could potentially make tools to make that work easier for me). </p>
<p>Any suggestions for where to begin?</p></div>
