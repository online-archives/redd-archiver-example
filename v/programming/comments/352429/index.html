The problem is that there is a reporting requirements that matches the .Net Crystal Reports /Dev Express type of reporting tools, designer and previewer.  Some of us have used Crystal Reports and strongly disliked it.  Others have used Dev Express XtraReports and, although still a little pricey, the team found that it was simple to use with a nice previewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that they are both .Net tools.  None of us have done much with these types of report tools in a non-.Net product and we don't have the time to reinvent the wheel or to have a big learning curve.  I suggested that we evaluate BIRT and Pentaho, but I'm not really a &quot;reporting tool&quot; developer, and the more experienced &quot;reporting tool&quot; devs  feel that those tools are a little overcomplicated for our needs.  
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking for a report framework with a web based report previewer and a report designer tool (can be windows only, but the more the better) for the less technical.  Basically, a Dev Express XtraReport framework for a Linux based environment, ideally free or below $1000.</p>
<p>Maybe my Google skills suck, but I couldn't find a good option.  Do you have suggestions?  Is Pentaho much less complicated than the team thinks? Are there other options?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any information is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.</p></div>
