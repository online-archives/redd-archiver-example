    <div class="md"><p>Deliberately work on something small and self-contained that I can completely finish in a short time. I get my motivation from finishing useful things, and large well-engineered systems can take months or years before I actually see my work /do/ anything. So if I'm starting to get depressed about my work, I do some home-handyman stuff or work on a throwaway &quot;hack project&quot; that I can knock off quickly without worrying about over-engineering it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Just keep your head down until you find something and leave on your terms. Be on the lookout for bad practice and management teams that over run their engineering teams with stupid requests. </p>
<p>One question I ask is, What is the strategy for dealing with technical debt and what was the last project that was completed that was entirely centered around addressing technical debt?  Another good one is, How often does developer thrash occur? It's impossible to feel like you are making progress somewhere if you are being moved on and off projects and bug hot fixes every other day. </p>
<p>Doing so also ham strings dev teams into never being able to do non trivial refactors to address technical debt in applications. If you are constantly waiting for the next omg freakout explosion or pie in the sky new feature request you would have to hack together and can never be proactive it's impossible to be happy doing this job.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've gotten burnt out programming before, and the answer was write more code.</p>
<p>More code, but different code. Burnout comes from working (or overworking) on a project that you're bored with.</p>
<p>Teach yourself machine learning, and create a PoC.</p>
<p>Delve into low-level programming and smash a stack or two, then learn to defeat ASLR and do it again.</p>
<p>Build another image hosting service (seems like a few voaters have been doing this one lately)</p>
<p>Find something that excites you and do that.</p>
