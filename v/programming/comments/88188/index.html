<blockquote>
<p><em>When we see someone who does not look like [a young fit clean cut white male], we assume they are not a real programmer, he said. Almost all of the women he knows in the industry have a story about someone assuming they aren't a programmer. He talked to multiple women attending PyCon 2015 who were asked which guy they are there with—the only reason they would come is because their partner, the man, is the programmer. &quot;If you're a dude, has anyone ever asked you that?&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a hint, when some guy at a sausage fest event (all with a collective fantasy of meeting a similarly interested and intelligent girl) ask a girl which guy she's with, it's not because of some sort of pseudo-societal stereotyping and implicit dogmatic oppression.</p></div>

<p>What are our metrics? Lines of code—what does that measure? <a href="https://agilefaq.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/what-is-a-story-point/">Story points</a>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminded me of a project I saw in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shittyprogramming">/r/shittyprogramming</a> maybe a year ago. It was 200,000 lines of code for a game of Battleship. Board analysis was done completely statically, meaning that he had entire case statement blocks for <em>each and every single position on the board</em> and used a single variable to store the board's state. Most hilarious thing I've ever scrolled through on pastebin.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Lest we forget that some the brightest and smartest programmers before the korean War took place (in the U.S. only) were female. In fact, some  of the best minds in the computer and digital industry (Atomic / Nuclear / Programming / Security / Software Engineering / Hardware architecture) were women, in different capacities. I would like to get back to this point. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it's about the skills and not the education, gender, sex, or status of what a person has. I've met a lot of smart women in my life but they were skilled at something that I was not. Higher math, high-level programming, hardware, analytics, and logic. Nowadays, it's easy to get <em>some</em> of those skills online. It's not about sexism or racism, now. It's about the technological divide between those who have the desire for the skill set and between those who do not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Err, I hoping I'm making sense. Please, at least give me the benefit of an ignorant doubt.</em> Thanks!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I think there's far too much emphasis on trying to prove the work environments are toxic as opposed to encouraging women to enter tech in the first place or fostering an environment that gaps that technological divide. The last I checked the applicant pool for my Alma Mater's Engineering School last year was 65-70% male and that was before the 'toxic' environments were experienced.</p></div>
