<p>For the last 17 years I've routinely needed to work with Pascal, C, Java, Perl, PHP, Bash, SQL and JavaScript.  On my own time I've done projects in C++, and I've even started writing an OS kernel (C and Assembly) that, so far, boots, handles keyboard input and has VERY basic memory management.

    <div class="md"><p>One might argue that these languages aren't &quot;wildly&quot; different, but I went from C++ to D and the results were fucking amaziballs.</p>
<p>Why? The core concepts of D isn't much different than C++, but the workflow is much more streamlined. Most of the things you absolutely HATE about C++ have been addressed. For instance, in C++ you are constantly reaching in the back of your mind to pull out some esoteric knowledge that only the greatest of greybeards possess. In D, for the most part, you can just do what you want without searching stackexchange for hours.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about trying new languages, I'd definitely look at D. Especially if you are using Java and hate it. It's basically a &quot;better Java without a virtual machine&quot;.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've went from C# to Perl to Ruby to Groovy/Java to Swift and currently transitioning to C. I can say with certainty that Java has earned a special amount of hatred in a corner of my heart. The tooling sucks, the documentation is haphazard (some of it good, the rest is a fucking minefield), the memory management and configuration for the tasks we used it for was a nightmare, and good luck finding validation for use cases.</p>
<p>We were using it to script things in JMeter, so that probably had a lot to do with it. I much preferred Groovy, but it's even worse on the memory side of things. The more modern JVM is much better about things but if you're confined to 1.7 then good luck. Also, each Java process needs to be kept to &lt;= 500 threads or bad things happen, which we didn't really know at the time. Really, this is why it's good to have one or two team members with really deep knowledge about a platform.</p>
<p>I think the language is less of an issue than the target platform honestly. So long as you have good library and framework support the language barely matters.</p></div>
