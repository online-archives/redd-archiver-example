<p>You all need to watch this and get familiar with the concepts to fight against it. You can see them attempting to frame the Opal debate around 'classes' of people based on their gender, race, creed, and sexual orientation. They are being the Useful Idiots right now, Stalin had them, Mao had them, Castro had them, they are always around to be used.</p>
<p>Call them out on how racist they are by labelling a black person a member of the 'black class' and there for cannot be anything but that.</p>
<p>Race, Creed, Gender, Sexual orientation are not CLASSES, they are ATTRIBUTES that define an individual.</p>
<p>I'm going to make new post on this, the OSS community needs to be more aware of what is going on.</p>

<p>What we see is an attack coordinated by a central entity and carried out by agents in the field. Whatever that central agency might be it is definitely not Marxist. </p>
<p>Their target is the Open Source Software community. So the most likely perpetrator is the CIA. This is as anti-marxist as it gets. </p>

<p>I'm not stating you are wrong and I'm happy to look into your point of view but saying this <em>isn't</em> Cultural Marxism is disingenuous.</p>
<p>Now if you make the case that cultural marxism <em>is</em> just a weapon being used against us <em>by</em> a specific group, that is something I already agree with you on.</p>
<p>Know your enemy, know yourself and you will win every battle. Cultural Marxism <em>is</em> the weapon of choice, it's why Islamist and Feminism share in common ground and why the left is supporting these people. It's because they are using them to continue the ideological battle against Western culture.</p>
<p>They <em>are</em> clearly Useful Idiots that are being used just like Stalin, Castro, Mao, etc used them in their own political take over.</p>
<p>Why do you think they are redefining gender, race, religion, creed, and sexual orientation as a class struggle. Marxism is <em>all</em> about creating oppresses classes and in turn the oppressed class has the right to 'rise' up against their 'oppressors'.</p>
<p>They moved the narrative from a Worker class struggles to a gender/sex/race/creed/religion class struggle, none of this ideology works unless you can frame it that way.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot</a></p>
<p>edit: You are also wrong that it is directed <em>solely</em> at the OSS community, it's directed at all communities and they use the same false outrage follow by demands for concessions, which they then use to continue to use as a platform for their false outrage(s).</p>
<p>2nd Edit: I upvoted you to cancel out the down vote. Let's try and not down voat dissenting opinions and points of view. I'd actually like if <a href="/user/caboose_calloway">@Caboose_Calloway</a> expands on his point of view. <em>We are better than that</em>.</p></div>

<p>Cultural Marxism is just an ideology. Like all ideologies it is based purely on belief. There is nothing provable or disprovable about something based on belief. Ideologies (all of them without reservation) are waste of time and therefore I refuse to deal with them. </p>
<p>On the other hand we have a most tangible series of attacks on a specific kind of people - Open Source software developers, places and people defending Free Speech and so on.  
</p>
<p>We have a probable causes for the attacks - Open Source software developers are providing means of secure communication and software resources alternative to commercial (invariably backdoored) software. They are also cutting on the bottom line of the biggest companies of USA. </p>
<p>We have opportunity - While the targets are usually well defended against cyber attacks they are foolishly open to social and economic attacks. We also know that contrary to what they claim CIA regularly conducts operations within the USA, including wet operations. They also conduct training and experiments on regular basis. With an extensive network and unlimited budget you can do this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We have precedent of similar attacks taking place.  Here is an example of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJtv6HOurLc">undercover FBI agent operating as crisis actor</a> in Burns - Oregon just a few days ago.</p>
<p>We have the precedent of deaths of Leader figures under suspicious circumstances. - Aaron Swartz, Ian Murdock, Michael Hastings... We have several <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/11/04/feminists-are-trying-to-frame-linus-torvalds-for-sexual-assault-claims-open-source-industry-veteran/">attempts at entrapment</a> targeting Linus Torwalds </p>
<p>At this stage whenever you see the term 'SJW' you can safely replace it with 'CIA Operative'. None of this has anything to do with ideology. These are field operations plain and simple. They have particular goals, definite targets and a precise plan of action. Leveraging various ideologies is part of that plan.</p>
<p>You are only helping them by making the ideology the focus of the debate. </p></div>

<p>Cultural Marxism is just an ideology. Like all ideologies it is based purely on belief. There is nothing provable or disprovable about something based on belief. Ideologies (all of them without reservation) are waste of time and therefore I refuse to deal with them.</p>

<p>People that identify with an Ideology and communicating what their belief structures are and that <em>absolutely does matter</em>. </p>

<p>On the other hand we have a most tangible series of attacks on a specific kind of people - Open Source software developers, places and people defending Free Speech and so on.</p>

<p>Totally agree, I was pointing out that the SJW are being used as Useful Idiots. I think we are conflating two different issues where, those that are running the game and those that are being used by them to change the rules of the game.</p>
<p>I was only commenting on the latter, the former I'm aware of but wasn't the issue I was highlighting and probably should have explained that better.</p>

<p>Except it is not ALL CIA operations, while I'll free acknowledge they will use them as Useful Idiots they do have their own agendas they are working for.</p>
<p>You are conflating two different issue, ideologies do matter regardless of your personal beliefs and how you feel.</p>
<p>So how is spreading information on their tactics and attack vectors, that will in turn help protect the OSS community from these social and economic attacks. I understand your point but you are underplaying the SJW role and how effect of a defence it is to disarm their ability to act.</p>
<p>It relies on the larger population staying ignorant of their agenda, tactics and hate mongers they actually are.</p></div>

<p>Very true, although I'd suggest that is a product of the last 20+ years teaching kids groupthink...or at least I'm honest enough to say I <em>hope</em> that is the case but I won't rule it out. I'm banking on the fact that people are cheap and if they can get someone to do it for free AND make them think it is their own idea, they will.</p>
<p>If they are being paid then they can't be Useful Idiots, they need to be unaware that they are being used to fall into that category. The paid ones are agent provocateurs and we definitely know they are used by all western police forces (RCMP has been caught doing it up here).</p>
<p>Hope for victory, plan for defeat, it's the only way to live.</p>
<p>Cheers and please stay on top of your view point, it's just as important, arguably more important, than knocking down the useful idiots.</p></div>

<p>Leads me to believe that there's an agenda behind this kind of thing.  All sorts of open-source getting attacked by these kind of people?  Clearly they don't have any interest in the projects or the programming, so their motivation must be something else.  If they don't have any interest in the project, then we can only assume that they aren't doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, and don't have the project's best interests in mind.</p>
<p>Logical conclusion: They want to harm open source projects.  And you don't go on the internet and try to harm open source projects without some motive for doing so.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If they were programmers that were involved in open source, and found that there were problems in the community, then you might have a point.  Instead, they're pushing their way into a group - a group that they don't know and don't understand, and have no reason to push their nonsense since they <strong>don't know anything about it</strong> - and trying to push their ideals onto people who didn't want them there in the first place.  If they don't understand the culture.. why do they think they know what the problem is?  The position of &quot;drama queen&quot; does not exist in the programming world.  Some programmers may be drama queens, but they're <em>programmers</em> first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand.. and I don't know why you got downvoted so hard.. but my point is that this is odd.  Even more so because open source projects couldn't really care about their nonsense, as it doesn't relate to code in any way.  It's more of an unwelcome intrusion, and if they weren't even part of the community then they're just out to make trouble.  &quot;Good intentioned individuals&quot; is possible, but seems unlikely.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way then to point out the flaws in the SJW agenda is that there is no definition for what is abuse or offense and no way to dispute the validity of an allegation or even if rhe alleged act occurred.  
</p>
<p>The offense could be anything perceived, hearsay made up or otherwise so it is just a means for enabling someone with a lack of scruples to threaten, libel and replace individuals within an organization.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the guys on the code team I worked on could barely be called human.  He should have been called 'Very Angry Programming Creature that drinks.  Alot&quot;  He was/is good.  Another guy I worked with was more of a 'Sloth that eats all day and blames you for his programming mistakes&quot; creature.  Wait..... I have an idea.  We could make a Programming Creature Manual for employers.  This will assist non-I.T. management in what they are seeing when they try to hire that next Rockstar Developer for your team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate the concept of being blocked from a project you've spent hours, days, months and years contributing to and making a difference on the project because you posted something on Twitter or another forum which has nothing to do with the project. Its a lot like the situation with Brendan Eich. He's given so much to the community. His contributions are the primary reasons why I have a job. </p>
<p>Then one day he contribute a couple thousand dollars to an organization that happens to support anti-gay sentiment, and then it becomes, thanks for your years of contribution, but fuck you and don't let the door hit you on the way out. Many of these fucking SJW's wouldn't even have a job without this man. </p>
<p>I really believe that a CoC is not a solution to anything. Meritocracy, especially in code production should be the one and only one thing that matters. </p>
<p>I have to put up with SJW at work places and its a fucking pain in the ass. Case in point, I worked at a bank and I worked with a guy who had a pretty abrasive personality. I found out its was more of a front because he's had to deal with so many shitty developers he now doesn't give you the benefit of the doubt but expects you to prove yourself to him before he warms up to you. Yeah its a bit shitty but I understand where his frustration comes from. Furthermore, he's said things in his frustration, that could be misconstrued to be very insensitive. But he is also an industry wide well know programmer in the banking industry. </p>
<p>After a few lesser developers, which by that I mean developers whose unit test if they write it at all always fails, code is always below par, missed delivery timelines almost all the time with a ton of excuses, but also punches out everyday before 5pm, started complaining about this guys behavior and how they thought his abusive personality is the reason why their code sucked so bad. The fact that this guy gave the bank almost 10 years and was one of the primary driving forces of the banking system they have didn't even come up as a consideration. </p>
<p>IMO, the response to these ass holes complaining about him should have been, &quot;eat shit and die&quot;, but they asked the guy to enroll in employee sensitivity classes and anger management classes. </p>
<p>The one thing I realized is that the people pulling the SJW card in tech always, always is people who do not contribute much to any project yet when the project is successful like an open source project they take credit like they worked on 90% of the project but their contributions are so miniscule that it was a grammar fix to the README file or some other small shit like that. </p>
<p>I wished github wouldn't give contribution credit to people whose contributions weren't accepted, no coding contribution, and it falls below a like 3% threshold. Right now it makes it easy to contribute nothing of value and makes it seem like you were a contributor like the CoralineAda bitch. All she's done is open tickets and try to get her CoC accepted and she's given credit like she was a coding contributor. I tried to look up her profile and couldn't find anything that indicated she was a programmer at all. Most of her activity is her stupid CoC and trying to push it on other projects.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah she's not a programmer. she just tries to stifle other programmers by bothering them with non-development issues.</p>
<p>every day, as a true open source contributor, I work with other programmers that I don't even know by real names, only screen names.</p>
<p>I could not care less about what their personal background is as long as they actually contribute to the project.</p></div>

<p>Women can claim rape or sexual assault even if you got consent because they regret it later. Claim you forced her or she was drunk or stoned.

<p>If this &quot;Covenant&quot; is accepted for the core language, I will have several Ruby books up for grabs.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, no computer language should <em>need</em> a covenant of any sort that polices thought and speech.

Arm the Moderator with something as ridiculous as a &quot;covenant&quot;, and all it takes is one bad day to get everything you breathe or type to be eradicated.</p>

<p>If my code sucks, say so.  (I probably know it already.)  A covenant requiring people to use nice words isn't going to improve my code.  Tell it like it is.  Be constructive.  I'll learn.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this all this woman has time for? Targeting open source projects with harassment and threats to OBEY her orders? I gather LGBT and racism are issues... but what the fuck has it got to do with software? It's not like a project such as ruby is filled with in-your-face messages promoting racial hate or homophobia. If anyone was, they'd be shunned and looked down on without the need for a CoC. </p>
<p>It's just getting fucking ridiculous. Why doesn't this excuse of a woman go travel to saudi arabia and campaign for LGBT rights where people are executed for being gay. Oh sorry, i just realised, you do not care about that. Your goal is to get attention and fuck things up for everyone else just so you can feel special and involved without actually contributing anything of your sorry ass.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I poked through the repository of the arrogant bully pushing this stuff and harassing people. Much of their code seems to be trivial wrappers for other libraries, plus scores of text documents about feminism and such, which have no business belonging on github as it is a code repository. Is anyone aware of anything significant this person has contributed to the technology field? Many of the people being harassed are significant and notable contributors who have done real work.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don't understand what feminists/SJWs have to gain by going after open source software? Like of all the oppression in the world, hell even of the completely made up oppression they think they experience in western society, a bunch of open source software projects have absolutely no connection to any of that. </p>
<p>Stuff like the ruby, django, php, and linux communities have no influence on anything that would ever have any noticeable impact on the average person or anyone outside of the development community. So why on earth have radical feminists made this their target? Same with gaming, why are they going after all these targets that have absolutely no involvement in the &quot;institutional sexism&quot; that they pretend exists and claim they're against?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>They're in those spaces for the same reason they are in indie game dev spaces, alt culture music genres, comics, youtube, and generally anywhere that is typically male dominated but not exclusively for men and have no barriers to entry based on gender or physical appearance in order to have the audience  &quot;opposition&quot; they desperately want to validated of their beliefs. Nothing proves you need feminism like being told that feminism has no place in a place which doesn't give a fuck about your gender, looks, beliefs, or pronouns. </p>
<p>You'd know that most open source places (and in the real world) have an unwritten &quot;close your mouth unless you've got something worth hearing&quot; policy meaning you don't get attention when you talk about shit unless there is a specific reason to pay attention to what you say. If you want to talk about this or that being sexist you would have probably been told that this isn't the place to discuss such things and anyone doing real work was just not interested. These ego parasites need to inject identity politics where ever they can because it erases the unwritten policy, it makes it important to listen to certain people because gender or race becomes a factor in a place where no one has a gender or race before now. </p>
<p>Codes of Conduct changes, anti harassment initiatives, <a href="https://archive.is/tQT85">women in X drives</a> etc from these people are all efforts to grandstand on the stage of identity politics because resistance proves you were right to suggest things change and acceptance demonstrates you are a progressive activist making the world a &quot;better&quot; place. That and they are always followed around by loud, poorly informed groupies who hear the key words of &quot;women, harassment, racism&quot; and chime in like they know anything. <sub><sub>(just like me)</sub>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. This is pretty terrible. Many people saying 'please don't censor this this way - it isn't necessary and can be used to hurt us by petty people who will be put in charge' and then the person who suggested it popping in every now and then saying 'Shh shh shh - I know what's best. We need these rules and people to rule over you. I know it didn't work in other communities, but here's an instance of someone acknowledging it didn't work, (virtually killing the community,) but thanking me for pushing for it. That's reason enough to implement it in this arena as well. If you don't want this, you are one of those people who want to hurt people in this community.'</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I agree with the spirit of anti harassment. I hope the community being free from any personal attacks nor trolling.</p>

<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove...</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If someone's misbehaving and you tell them to chill, both could be removed from the project for misbehaving and for not enforcing the CoC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>&quot;unprofessional conduct&quot;</strong> (in the screenshot)</p>
<p>What has professionalism go to do with open source / free / libre software. Torvalds is a perfect example of why it isn't needed. Tell it how it is, give the finger to nvidia, and tell people when their code is shit -- they get the point immediately and they learn from it. If it makes you cry, then fix it if you want your code merged.</p>
<p>Otherwise people assume they are doing the right thing, when they are not. Look at a bunch of kids... When little peter can't even scribble a stick figure, and the teacher goes &quot;awww well done, that's brilliant&quot; they keep drawing shitty scribbles. Tell them it's shit, make them cry, and they will learn how to improve things. I'm not saying you should literally swear at your children, but for the sake of telling it how it is -- this is better than professionalism -- it encourages advancement and learning for everyone.</p>
<p>Professionalism is a strange lived-out fantasy (particularly if you wear a suit and sit in an office of clones), i find it bizarre, and tend to associate it with psychopathy. The idea of pretending you are some kind of shrink wrapped plastic figure who conforms to all &quot;norms&quot; defined by an individual is baffling.</p>
<p>Professionalism is not needed in the open source world. The whole point of freedom is just that. To be free from monopolization and corporation. It is essentially the anarchy of computing, it does not require political correctness or Code of Cocksucking agreements and contracts.</p>
<p>Sorry, rant over.</p></div>

<p>Codes of conduct should never be in a language core I think.  What could be enforced, unless the language itself was proprietary and licensed per use?  It is fine that people are pissed.

    <div class="md"><p>Judging by the comments in that entire thread I do think the SJW side has a point. It's just about making the Ruby community not be full of asshole neckbeards. Is it any coincidence that the angriest, most hostile people in that thread are those opposing it? It's because they can't make any coherent argument as to why it is a bad thing. Also, Eric S. Raymond is a little bit nutty. Is it any coincidence a software development would be a gun nut? Like hello, you're not tough, you're a computer nerd. You'd probably lose to a 12 year old in an actual fight. Not to mention all the minority groups he probably wants to shoot.</p></div>
