    <div class="md"><p>Assuming you are working from Github, this might not be possible. You'd be limited by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Github API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The capabilities of the browser to display an arbitrary file. Can a browser naturally display diagrams from Omnigraffe? If not, you are screwed. What happens when your client wants to display a file type that no browser supports?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Browsers aren't meant to display EVERY arbitrary file type. Sometimes Microsoft will go further than the standard and build functionality to read .doc files, but why would Microsoft spend resources to display Omnigraffle files?</p>
<p>There might be a plug-in that allows a browser to display a specific file (For instance PDFs), but this is something your client is going to need to install on a case by case basis on his browser, and not all browsers might have a plug-in for that file type. (If a plug-in exists at all).</p>
<p>This sounds like a case where your client would rather be stubborn and expect reality to conform to his wishes, as opposed to learning the proper way of working collaboratively. You probably won't be able to appease this person, so, one way or another he is probably going to get angry.</p>
<p>You might as well grow some balls and accept that he isn't going to like the &quot;Realistic Solution&quot; and then, when the Wookie calms down, teach him the &quot;Realistic Solution&quot;.</p>
<p>Or, you can make promises you can't keep. See how that works out for you.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Send your client a link to this message and I'll be the one to break the news to him.</p></div>
