<p>I also have to type in the code from a text every time I want to login because github narks on you if you dont have two factor authentication. Please tell me ONE reason why github is better than TFS and if you say microsoft I'll reach through the internet and &lt;ITAR REDACTED&gt;</p></div>

<p>On a more serious note, basically nothing if you're not planning to ever make the source available to other people. The point of the git model is being able to easily and flexibly allow people access so projects can have an explosive number of contributors. IDK maybe they're outsourcing your IT team.

<p>Sooo . . . Short answer, no. </p></div>

</blockquote>
<p>Wait, are you talking about logging in whenever you need to push/pull a change from a repo on Github? There's a better way. Set up an ssh key by going into your settings and putting your public key in the ssh settings. Then to use that key instead of a password when pushing/pulling you'll need to add an entry to your ssh config like so:</p>
<pre><code>Host myGithub
    IdentityFile ~/.sshkeys/myGithubkey
    HostName github.com
    User git
</code></pre>
<p>Then, set up your remote url (for your repo) to be something like <code>myGithub:MyUsername/MyRepo.git</code>. Then whenever you push/pull your repo, it should use your key automatically and you will not have to log in (unless your key is protected with a password, then ssh-agent's key caching could help with that) .</p>
<p>EDIT: Your ssh config file should be named &quot;config&quot; and reside in a &quot;.ssh&quot; directory in your home directory. Not sure if it's the same for Windows but I think that should work.</p>
<p>EDIT2: When specifying the url for remote, you will need to replace &quot;myUsername@github.com&quot; part with the hostname specified in the config file.</p></div>
