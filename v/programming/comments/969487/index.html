    <div class="md"><p>With tireless development of technology and rising number of office workers has appeared a demand to organize electronical data. We are getting lost in files on our pc screen even though we well know we should systemize it. Colleagues are bothering each other with million emails and are constantly looking for already finished work.</p>
<p>BrandCloud is filling a distressing hole in the market. It brings a revolution in keeping and sharing data. Instead of  common files and folders, it allows you to boost them with metadata. Although the word metadata may discourage someone not very comfortable in IT technology, it is an extremely handy tool. In fact this information describe when, how and why to use files themselves. In reality can this metadata be formed by regular notes, pictures, videos, audios, views of other files, galleries or some other elements.</p>
<p>Usefulness of BrandCloud app has been found by regular companies and marketing or design agencies. They do not need to send logo to their client ten times. They do not need to communicate by email usage of the logo, why is not appropriate to put it on a dark background or how to insert it to advertising materials. For them is fine to easily send the file via BrandCloud, so the client now in few seconds how to use it.</p>
<p>Thanks to BrandCloud´s flexibility there are several options how firms find it helpful. The first way is an online brand manual, which keeps brand assets always safe and ready to send into the world. The second choice is to lighten work of franchisors. They are able to send staff uniform design or even a best burger recipe to all of branches at once or just to the one that needs it. Another option for firms is to use BrandCloud as a marketing assets management tool, to save all flyers, banners, articles or materials for press conference. They can share the needed documents to the right people.</p>
<p>One of the most elementary functions of BrandCloud app is exporting to pdf. That can be effective for for designers when creating logo manuals. Another convenient feature is versioning: in  the app is only the up-to-date version but the older ones are still traceable. Thanks to notifications will the user stay informed about creating documents and their editing. BrandCloud also may simplify sharing content with the right people, inside BrandCloud and also externally.</p>
<p>After understanding nature of BrandCloud application a simple question usually pops up: “What is the difference between BrandCloud and well-known clouds like Google Drive?” The answer is also simple. Structure of BrandCloud is not just regular files and folders but it also contains a layer of metadata. Notes, videos, galleries.. They boost typical structure, so everyone knows immediately how to use it.  BrandCloud app is also primarily made for and adapted to business sector. It has advanced level of assigning user rights, own branding and simplified sharing and distributing to bigger number of users. BrandCloud also offers a public profile.</p></div>
