<p>Anyway, let's get more serious. Up until quite recently, I wasn't really active on voat. Shame's on me for this. I want to apologize, and to be quite honest, I didn't even realize the state of this subvoat until <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/271008">this post by V-sync</a>. I was reluctant to make changes to the sub as there were other mods, and me being there for a few days compared to over a year the others were was a tad intimidating.</p>
<p>I became moderator of this sub because I mentioned in <a href="https://voat.co/v/introductions">/v/introductions</a> that I wanted to help build a nice place for programmer talk on this website, and Atko swiftly, after asking me, made me a moderator. You can stalk my profile if you want to see for yourself ;)</p>
<p>I added the RSS feed of this subverse to my RSS reader, and there's me hoping that the feature does work. Maybe I'll tinker with the API to build a tool to better moderate this sub. We're coders after all, right?</p>
<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>My voat nick is Craftkorb, you can call me Korb though if you prefer. I currently study computer science in Germany, though I began coding when I was 10 years old. I know C++/Qt quite well, having done that for quite a few years, and currently I'm in the process of getting the same amount of experience with Ruby and Ruby on Rails for web development.</p>
<p>Living in Germany means that my time zone is UTC+1. Sorry americans.</p>
<p><strong>About the subvoat</strong></p>
<p>I'll try to get hold of Atko to get the other moderators removed. Knowing the current situation of Voat, that may take a while though for him to respond.</p>
<p>I'd like to welcome two or three other moderators too, so if anyone wants to wave your hand. </p>
<p><strong>I apologize again. If you have questions, suggestions, whatever, post 'em here!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Modified the sidebar a bit. Now contains the rules I outlined below.</p>
<p><strong>Edit²</strong>: Played a bit with the CSS. Whatcha think?</p>
<p><strong>Edit³</strong>: Not sure if the sidebar is the best thing ever like it's now, but it's good enough for me. Open to critique.</p>
<p><strong>Edit⁴</strong>: Ok, I'm off for today. Will come back tomorrow, so if anything turns up ask away!</p>
<p><strong>Edit⁵</strong>: Has been a sticky for two days now, I think that's enough primetime stop for this post and thus unsticky it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><h1>What sort of things do you want to see on v/programming?</h1>
<h2>Philosophy and the Community</h2>
<ol>
<li>I want <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> to be a general hub on programming related talk. It shall not be dedicated to specific programming languages.</li>
<li>The only language restriction in this subvoat shall be the English language though. It's awesome if you write a well-written article on how to do something interesting in another language, but I want this place to be accessible for everyone.</li>
<li>I'll remove anything that discourages people from learning. Stupid shit like &quot;Wow ur so dumb u didn't even kno dat?!&quot;. We've all been there. We should do the opposite: If someone finds out something you took for granted, tell that user about related things (s)he may also be interested in!</li>
<li>We all think that trolling is funny sometimes. But if it gets too much, I'll remove the comment, okay? If you're a serial offender, I think that banning the user is quite funny too. Programmers have humor. Some jokes are perfectly fine by me, and being laid back is fine too as long the discussion is productive in general. If there's a circle jerk in a thread, I'll leave it be as long others won't be too annoyed by it (Please report these!).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Content I want to see</h2>
<ol>
<li>Educational content. This one's hard to find a balance between &quot;Is not too obvious but well known so ok&quot; and &quot;Has been done to death and should be put somewhere else&quot;. An article showing off what crazy things you can do by abusing Hashes with blocks and all in ruby is ok. If you post an article stating that you can do <code>{ foo: 123 }</code> in ruby, then I'd rather want to see that somewhere else.</li>
<li>Technology. We all like the new stuff coming out. A new framework which lets you write a webchat in 3 lines of code? Bring it on! (But please don't repost D:)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Content I don't want to see (too often)</h2>
<ol>
<li>&quot;My program broke, please help&quot;. I think that <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> is a general hub on programming in general, and thus there are better forums on the internet for these questions. <strong>I will however not remove these posts</strong> as long they don't get too much, as they' can still be educational.</li>
<li>Memes. Please no. We can have a separate subvoat for that. I'd probably subscribe to it! But <a href="/v/programming">/v/programming</a> is not the place for it. Will be removed on sight.</li>
<li>Advertising job offers, companies, discounts, etc. &quot;FooBar Corp is hiring in Montreal!&quot; Nice for them! Will be removed on sight though.</li>
<li>Clickbait titles. Yes, I knew about these 10 facts, and no, fact 4 didn't blow my mind. Has a good chance of being removed.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Are you going to do anything to stop blog spam?</h1>
<p>The distinction is not always easy. Clickbait titles may end up being removed. If the article is just talking about this cool new product by some company, then I count that as advertisement and will remove it. But I'll also say that I probably won't read everything. Reporting such submissions is appreciated.</p>
<h1>What about a wiki or post or something for a FAQ?</h1>
<p>Good idea, haven't thought anything about it yet. I think that this is a perfect thing to be done by the community with the moderators making sure it's useful information. As of yet, I think some links on &quot;how to start programming&quot; would be helpful, but I don't know any good articles nor books on that. Though I'd appreciate a wide range of them: Yes, a beginner can learn C. No, it's not too complicated. If you repeatedly tell them that it is, they'll of course never use it. Let them judge themselves! Other than that, I'm tbh clueless on this one.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Might want to sift through the comments of the posts yourself, see if there are any users that more or less are consistent in the comments as being well respected. Maybe send a message to one of the folks over at <a href="/v/algorithms">/v/algorithms</a> if they are interested in modding more then one sub. Maybe phrase it as more looking for someone who does more CSS shenanigans, and go from there. Or, reach out to V-sync, or one of the commentators in that post if they're down for literally helping out. (EDIT: Wrote this piece before refreshed, and saw V-sync in this thread, use his skills if none others are offered). </p>
<p>Though I guess if there is a AMA question, what is one paper/article/defcon presentation/[insert document of your choice here] that stands out as opening your mind as to what programming can do? What is one that more people should read, or reread?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I technically agree on the popularity thing, the issue I have with that is defining what's popular and what's not. This subvoat currently boasts almost 15k subscribers (Roughly a third of <a href="/v/askvoat">/v/askvoat</a>) and is a default sub, so in terms of Voat, it's not super small nor really unpopular. Also, as someone said somewhere else (I think in this thread?), it's way harder to split up communities after they've pretty much settled. If we were to add the no-meme-and-stuff rule later on, we could ruin any reputation we had until that point (Whatever kind of rep that is/was). So instead of splitting up the community later on, I want to do it <em>now</em> and actually encourage someone to open up <a href="/v/programmerhumor">/v/programmerhumor</a> or something, which I may also link in the related subs section in the sidebar. It's a bit UNIX philosophy: We want to do one thing, and do that well :)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm just getting into it, and right now it's not much work at all to be honest. The community pretty much moderates itself already.</p>
<p>I've never moderated a big forum anywhere, and ended up in here more by accident than anything else; I've no idea how much work a fifty-fold increase of the userbase affects the needed moderation. But, I'm already trying to get full hold on this subvoat so I can manage moderators. What's annoying though is that voats moderation tools are not only bad (Like at reddit), they're non-existant. Mod mail? It's a stub. Want to report something? Good luck finding the button (There's none), and if you want to be helpful and thus report by mod mail, well, still a stub. If you now think &quot;Well .. then let me message one of the mods&quot;, you have a chance of 87.5% of choosing a inactive moderator from the moderator list. How fucked up is that?</p>
<p>I thought about building a small bot, which goes through all comments and looks for &quot;!report&quot; as crude work-a-round. Well, as voat is currently &quot;under attack&quot;, I can't write a HTML parsing one without having a real browser, and as there's no real API I can't use that one either.</p>
<p>I conclude: I try to get hold of the subverse (But no idea if Atko will read my message), the moderation work is currently perfectly doable, and the mod tools are not there.</p></div>

I'd upvote you for the answer right now but I have to wait because I don't have the necessary points yet :-)</p></div>

<p>Sure, I'd need to compile a short list somehow. Thinking of <a href="/v/algorithms">/v/algorithms</a>, <a href="/v/learnprogramming">/v/learnprogramming</a> or <a href="/v/noobprogramming">/v/noobprogramming</a> (Those guys should probably merge?) and <a href="/v/techcareerquestions">/v/techcareerquestions</a>. Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Awesome! I'd send you a invite if I had a button to do so. I was wondering if I should post to <a href="/v/subverserequest">/v/subverserequest</a>. I'm a mod, but then, I don't seem to have all permissions either.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few subverses related to programming in some way.  machine learning, compsci, computerscience, learnprogramming, etc...  You can probably just think of a topic and find a subverse that exists.</p>
<p>Yeah you need to have created the subverse to add a new moderator it seems.  You will need to post on <a href="/v/subverserequest">/v/subverserequest</a> to get control of this one.  Good luck.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I want to be active here too. My background: I fucking love python. I know a lot of real programmers consider it to be the newb language, but there is something about how natural everything feels that I just want to do everything in python. Python is what really helped me grasp the concept of object oriented programming. And loop iteration is just so easy when dealing with arrays. Dictionaries? Why did no one tell be about dictionaries until 6 months ago. I love dictionaries! They are amazing! Everything is so clean, source code from other authors is so easy to read! Python jailbreaking is so much fun!</p>
<p>TLDR: python is alright</p></div>

And as suggestion, please differentiate the css style (color) between quotes and comment replies though. Sometimes it's swapped each other when I read them.</p></div>
