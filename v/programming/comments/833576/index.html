When you write one as a structure you write things like &quot;getHead&quot; and no one bats an eye because <em>that's what the function does</em>.

    <div class="md"><p>Much more to the point, that person sounds like a moral-crusading church busybody.</p>
<p>That's really <em>exactly</em> what all this nonsense is pretty much identical to.  It's different rhetoric, but it's the same sort of people engaging in the same sort of destructive crap.  It's bitter, spiteful, self-involved, judgmental prigs looking for something to be offended over, then self-righteously condemning the evil sinners who offend them.</p>
<p>It's the Moral Majority of the 21st century.</p></div>

<p>BTW, the comments on the blog are all song/literary quotes because he is replacing all the disagreeable comments (such as I'm sure your point would be) with placeholder text instead of responding to them.  Why not just delete them, I don't know... apparently prefers libel (leaves the user name intact but with completely different comment) to simple censorship.  &quot;what an asshole.&quot; yes!</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The second was a set of emails from Duncan Murdoch, President of the R Foundation and an R Core member, in which he dismissed my &quot;bug report&quot; (note the skeptical scare quotes he put on it) &quot;about some variable name that you find offensive is clearly an example of nothing more than shit-disturbing&quot; and stated that myself, and those who had commented in favour of changing it, were no longer welcome to participate in R's bug-tracker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand how one might paint that as an overreaction, but considering the kind of garbage that's happened over on GitHub I completely agree. If you want a professional environment, then behave professionally. Don't go looking for reasons to take offense to things and then derail the whole project because you're too immature to handle standard programming nomenclature. There is work to be done, no one is interested in your imaginary problems.</p></div>

<p>The author is probably a shit programmer anyway; nothing of value was lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if you can make that generalization. I've run into a few prima donna's who think they are god's gift to programming and most are wrong, but every now and then, the shits are correct.</p>
<p>Saying that, MAJORITY of over sensitive prima donna programmers are pretty shit programmers. </p>
<p>The big problem I see with this is, opening a bug ticket for a variable name. Whether he felt justified or not, he made a few project noobie blunders. </p>
<p>1) If he really felt it was worth addressing, he should have brought it up to the project administrator, not through the bug system; it wasn't a bug.
2) He changed the variable name via repo checkout, when the usual process, if it was a legitimate bug, would be to raise a ticket and let it be assigned to the original developer, or get distributed.</p>
<p>He obviously has a flagrant disregard for good processes that make working on source code manageable and I think Duncan's response &quot;shit-disturbing&quot; is appropriate. </p>
<p>I don't care if it was &quot;iPoundYouInTheAssWhileMyBuddyGetsHead&quot;. Its not a bug. If you've ever built a complex programming software, you know what a developer uses for variables is one of the lowest priorities. I don't bring it up in code review unless its so generic like 'a', 'b', or not descriptive enough in an area of code where a better name would also serve as an ad hoc documentation, its not worth mentioning even if it was an intended pun. This is so reminiscent of the CoC BS thats trying to infiltrate the open source community. </p>
<p>The funny part is, it looks like the decision to participate in the community was taken away from him as he was locked out and banned. Now he's trying to make it seem like it was his decision not to be an active participant. Sour grapes anyone?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing worth mentioning, too, is that if this is a function or a variable, just changing the name in one spot is usually not good enough. If it's a breaking change, now you have to search your entire code base and make sure that there are no references that also need to be updated, then test that those changes work, and on and on. Very time consuming for what amounts to a man-child who can't handle words</p></div>

<p>Bad developers always look for ways to make themselves seem relevant and appear they are contributors but most tickets they work on are tickets they've opened, which are BS tickets that fix stupid shit like grammar or spelling, but looking at the git activity log, make it seem like they are active on the project.</p>
<p>I'm only referencing the fact that this is a Stanford project so just maybe, giving him some benefit of the doubt, he may be a good developer and also a &quot;politics (social,gender,etc)&quot; pussy. </p></div>

<p>Agreed. If someone wanted it changed, and they also contributed elsewhere on the project,t I'm sure it would be changed without question. But this person didn't really care about the variable name. Their mind is just obsessed with this invisible oppression and they felt they needed to expose how the patriarchy is ever present. It would be like me going on a subtle anti-Semite tirade about somehow based on Jews owning all the tech companies, in a bug reporting forum. Giant fucking waste of time and highly unprofessional.</p></div>

And I have 0 doubt a non-zero number of those 'contributions' were similar to the amazing value offered by changing a variable's name because it offends you. I'm not sure how the community will get on without such an amazingly productive member.</p></div>

<li>
<p>There are people involved in the central organization of languages who very, very, much care about &quot;PR&quot; in the way they understand it.</p>

<li>
<p>The leader of the R foundation is a troll.</p>

<p>I would have posted that bug report with the title,&quot;Damn isn't this funny.&quot;    Humor deflates the people hating eachother, everyone just seemed hellbent on not having fun with it.

<p>Consequently thank you for posting this.  It was hilarious.</p>

<p>uh, even if we were to accept the lunatic premise that shit like this in any way shape or form mattered in the least, <em>how</em> is that exclusionary?</p>
<p>Are they implying that only women can give head to men? I've heard the term &quot;head&quot; used to describe oral for both sides.

    <div class="md"><p>The infantilism of this all is astounding. </p>
<p>Lets accept there is a term &quot;Safe Space.&quot; By the very definition it is not an attenable standard, because the standard is based upon the offended, self-centered, narcissistic views of the children, who believe their reality of how they feel is controlling on the environment around them. This is the most fundamental and basic construction of a child. A child is one who believes the world assimulates to their world. Adults adapt to the world. We have self righteous individuals with their prospective of how the world should be based on the idealofy they were indoctrinated without any self discovery. The world is turning slowly towards being operated by children world's whims and caprices. </p>
<p>Case in point. Dear programmer that quit. As an African- American, I find your use of interger &quot;N&quot; offensive. Why did you have to use a &quot;N&quot; word? As the person who is offended, I Am going to define the reason why - it is subconscious product of your racism, that as a privileged individuals you have inherited through your racists culture. I see it as offensive and exploitative of the past, for the numbers must be carried on the &quot;N&quot;'s backs.</p>
<p>Yet, he is in fact making such absurd proclamations. Furthermore, he aknowledges his own very sexist and ignorant nature by stating he would have deleted similar comments if it was for religion, women, or ideology unrelated. He is justifying sexism -- that is what SEXISTS people do. He is on hyperbolic crusade against others using others acts he despises to justify himself. That is the very definition of a hypocrite. </p>
<p>He needs to act as an adult and not as a racist child he is. Stop empowering children by not engaging in their self-centered fallacies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a fucking long comment, so I apologize in advance.  It started out short.</p>
<p>I'm reluctant to comment here because there seems to be a lot anger towards this guy, and it seems weird to try to ask a broader question.  However, why does this one person quitting matter so much to warrant such vitriol?  Is his behavior a huge threat to anyone personally?  I don't care that much about the individual here - I'm far more interested in what the whole incident was about, and the social context.  My real question is below: Do we want more women developers or not? </p>
<p><strong>Re: coding chops</strong></p>
<p>The one trait I've found from people I've respected... at least the ones I consider the most talented, is their ability to recognize how much they don't know.  So, in general, when I see any comments in a forum about people's coding chops, I know that statistically the odds are fair that a lot of the commenters are not the top 1% most skilled coders.  I, myself, fully recognize some of people I've worked with have accomplished remarkable things, well beyond what I might hope to accomplish. I only consider myself experienced due to year count in the industry, but I can't judge my own tech skills objectively.  Thus, I seriously doubt I'm a top 1% coder, so someone out there is better doing a chop busting code review of this guy's stuff than me, and better than 99% of us.  But the bottom line is: I don't think there's much value in evaluating this guy's coding chops...  it's not really the point of the article.</p>
<p><strong>Re: process, tech standards, naming conventions</strong></p>
<p>If it were me, I wouldn't have filed a bug.  I might have done a patch, submitted it, and jokingly put in a comment.  Reduce possible conflict around something that doesn't matter much - why not, provided risk cost were low?  The variable name doesn't bother me, but I'd consider the cost of doing the patch, what how other people might view it, and try to see the risk/reward.  I don't see a minor refactoring as necessarily expensive, depending on the quality of the unit test support around it, the possible supporting tools (IDEs, code generation) and the overall infrastructure.  Variable names get changed all the time for more whimsical reasons. AND, honestly, why didn't any actual discussion about this occur between the two parties?  Was there existing tension?  God knows, if not, I'd say a banning seems a little harsh - kind of like &quot;I'm going to take my ball and go home.&quot; Maybe the guy's prerogative, but still, it seems like the individual involved had been a team member who invested time in the project...  Btw, the notion that iGiveHead doesn't have any meaning...  I'd disagree.  getHead for a linked list method, fine.  But using Hungarian notation for an integer with a method-like name strikes me as not labeled well at best.  Does it have possible sexual innuendo?  Sure! or we would not be discussing it at all.  C'mon, I think we can at least agree on that.  In the end, a variable name is not a bug, following technical process has merit, and you balance risk against upside in all situations.  I'm not really savvy enough to their whole software lifecycle to make a technical decision on what cost and risk really existed.  It just seems like again, this is not the white elephant in the room, the core point of discussion. </p>
<p><strong>Re: do we want women working with us or not?</strong></p>
<p>I see loads of these discussions busting people for language, SJW attitudes, that sorta stuff...  but to me, we're not even discussing the real issue. As coders, do we want women working with us or not in the workplace?  I personally actually enjoy having women around; like any set of people, there are some I've liked more than others, although honestly there haven't been many women coders over the years.  If most coders do not want women around, fine.  At this point, I can't really tell.  All I know is that during tech interviews, a lot of guys I've worked with seem to be <em>fairly interested</em> in hiring women...  We obviously want to <em>sell</em> tech products to women, so it seems like having women involved in that process might have some merit.  And if we <em>do</em> want women (big 'if'), does anything need to change?  What is acceptable to people, what is too far, is there room for any discussion on it at all?  My guess is that if we did want more women working with us, we'd probably need to see if we're making it more or less likely to attract them to the industry.</p>
<p>Again, I'm not going to say one way or another is better, and hell, for each tiny subset of humanity and team, maybe it's different.  All I know is that to me a lot of times the comments usually avoid the meatier part of the discussion.  Maybe it's not possible online, but I like to think the net provides new venues for conversation. In places like Voat that pride themselves on freedom of speech, I'm still hopeful that even if I get shat upon for posting a non-confrontational comment about the scenario, that some people are still interested in looking at the bigger issues...  I'm intentionally trying not to pounce on anyone, my comments are solely my own, and <em>I'm just really curious if fellow devs want women working beside them or not.  Even a yes or no might work</em>: I have no interest in judging anyone for it - it's pure curiosity.</p>
<p>I really questioned whether I would post this at all, b/c is it risky to post it?  It's easier not to, but if Voat is really about freedom of speech and challenging status quo, I'd like to see if discussion can happen around something definitely seems like a topic in the industry.  But fuck it, I <em>am</em>  curious, and I do wanna know if I'm going to be in an industry where for the next twenty years I'll be surrounded solely by guys until ai takes over.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Another typical shit head woman working in IT.  I have worked in IT for over 30 years.  Hell I remember computers when they still had vacuum tubes. (ever hear of SAGE) i worked on it. Women in IT have one particular trait.  It is not that they are smart, most of them are.  Their biggest problem is they cannot work with anyone.  It has to be all about them.  If they don't get what they want, they sulk and pout then start causing trouble.  They go over your head for what they think is a insult.  They go to HR at the drop of a hat.  They show up a meeting always late, with some bull shit excuse.  They sit in a back row and contribute nothing then complain how the meetings are worthless. When they finally cant get their way and move on they always do in in public, thanking a lot of smart people they worked with and taught her so much, and were really cool to work with.  How ever if you ever talk to those people you will find they thought that she was a first class bitch.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'd respectfully disagree - at least in my experience.  I've actually seen more male prima donna coders than women by far; I can't even think of a single massive female tech ego that I've worked with.  Hell, out of the couple thousand people I've worked with, I can almost count the women techies under 20-30 total.  Plus, guys love flame wars more, I think, when a guy gets angry you can tell that the anger is going to come out <em>somewhere</em>.  There's definite bravado in it.  Hell, I've done my own share of trying to skewer someone over what amount to technical ideological differences...  prolly was just my testosterone kicking in for what was really minor shit, looking back on it twenty years later.</p>
<p>It's just my personal experience though.  If you coded years before me (in the 1970s?) and had different experiences, cool.  I've worked for just shy of forty companies now, and every place has been different.  The ideological tech battles seem to depend squarely on the culture of the place, to me anyway (think Microsoft v open source, etc).</p>
<p>Anyway, guess we just had different experiences - thanks for telling your story too.  btw, my first project was doing a punch card replacement sys, so odds are you've been doing it longer...</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Who do people want to work with?</p>
<p>I don't know exactly, but I know who I don't want to work with, and who I actively avoid: people who are so sensitive that they could literally lose their shit at any moment for a perceived slight when none was intended.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with women, it has nothing to do with minorities, it has nothing to do with social justice.</p>
<p>It has everything to do with not being in a hypercritical mindset in order to achieve the goals of the organization you are working for.</p>
<p>The reason for the vitriol is that NO ONE wants to be walking on eggshells constantly while working. The only way to send this message to SJW fucktards is to mercilessly eviscerate their behaviour every time it occurs, or the problem only gets worse and worse. It's like giving in to a four year old, then expecting that if you keep doing that they will become normal humans instead of entitled drama queens.</p>
<p>Tl;dr 
You have to treat adults who act like toddlers in a manner that sends a message to the other adults who are thinking about acting like toddlers.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... well, the best thing about freedom of speech is that people can say what they want.  So let both sides speak their peace and let the pieces fall wherever.  I don't see either side's commentary as implicitly having more value.  Having said that, I'm not keen on walking on eggshells myself, but I just haven't experienced it (been at loads o' companies).</p>
<p>Two things I kinda feel about corps: 1) They are profit oriented, so they tend to prefer organizational discipline.  People that contribute positively stick around, others don't. I haven't seen anywhere myself where folks are &quot;walking on eggshells&quot; such that the corporate profit motives are so diminished that it disrupts the entire workplace unless specific legal issues have arisen, which has been rare in my book. 2) Corporations (big or small) tend to be legally averse.  In cases of actual discrimination, harassment, fiduciary fraud, money laundering, etc, they have structured programs to avoid law suits.  The laws already exist for most of these situations; a number of the larger companies sometimes force you to learn their additional rules so they avoid 'operational risk' (read: brand risk, the association of their company name with acts they don't like).  My bigger beef with corporations is that they literally force you to give away privacy rights on email, chat, financials, legal, whatever you sign when you sign a contract.  This often applies to companies of all sizes; it's a litigated nation. As a worker, you tend to be pretty powerless in most states. Their corporation legal/compliance courses tend to be a nuisance mostly.  So typically, at most companies, I don't see individuals calling the shots at all - it is the corporations entirely.</p>
<p>If you want to campaign against the corps for their application of social justice, that's cool...  I just haven't seen actual individuals as the driving reason why company rules are made generally... I'd bet the bulk of the rules are made on the basis of existing law, with corporate choices made to reduce legal risks.</p>
<p>Have you had to walk on eggshells at your company?  Totally curious about that.  I've been at companies tiny (a few people) to huge (international) and I just haven't even felt like anything I said, even inflammatory got me in hot water... only with the person I was arguing with.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>These people don't seem to understand that they'll always be offended.  They'll never get rid of all the words that offend them.  Because to them, anything used as a euphemism for something that offends them is permanently tainted.  So they get the words banned.  Then people just use a different euphemism.  So that gets banned too.  Rinse and repeat forever.  The more words you ban because they were tainted by euphemism, the more words people will adopt as euphemisms.  Because people yearn to say naughty things.  And you can't fix that, no matter how many words you ban.</p></div>

<p>Yknow, its kind of a shame that productive members of a creative community would end up leaving over this trivial shit. I almost dont think she should have been banned from bugtracker, but i like the hardline on sjw shitstirring. Its just too trivial i cant sympathize. But people are voluntarily fucking their careers up over dick jokes, intentional or not. If they would do this, what would they gladly do to others for such genocidal behaviour as patriarchy reinforcing dick jokes. On balance, nothing of value was lost today.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone is wondering, the random comment quotes on the blog is because the dramatist is replacing the comments he doesn't want to respond to (i.e. almost all of them) with placeholder text to make the problem go away.  (Why not just delete them?  I don't know.  Wants the ego trip of having a lot of comments, just without the negative ones maybe?  Oh man the South Park &quot;Safe Space&quot; episode is so on point...)</p>
<p>Anyway what else would you expect from someone who tries to pass off being kicked out as &quot;resigning&quot;?  Reality can take a hike, this person is staying in their filter bubble.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is confused. Women are the primary givers of head, therefore this variable is more inclusive than others. It is also inclusive to gay men. I think they should add a variable iGoDown to be more inclusive to lesbians and straight men. Oh, and I give Head is also inclusive to jihadists, who behead people and give those heads to their imams. Not sure what this guy is bitching about, this variable is inclusive as hell.</p></div>
