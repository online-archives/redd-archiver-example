    <div class="md"><p>The most valuable knowledge for hacking is to know how everything works. Once you know how the OS, software, etc works (not just how to use it), you can start finding ways to break it. </p>
<p>Think of picking a lock. If you know how the lock works, you can carefully dissect it and break it open. If you don't know how it works (but you know how to use it), you can just kick it in or something. Obviously, kicking the door in makes it obvious you're there. Quietly picking the lock, however, doesn't really let anyone know. </p></div>

<p>Also ethical hacker means that sooner or later you will end up into a lawsuit. So focus on understanding the law is you want to pursuit that. Not only the law in your country but also the law in other countries.</p></div>
