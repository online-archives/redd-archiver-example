<blockquote>
<p>Apple dictates that all new apps must fully support the iPhone X screen | Ars Technica </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Today, Apple emailed iOS developers to explore new features in iOS 11 like ARKit. ', &quot;It makes sense to require devs to support the iPhone X for new apps—devs would be shooting themselves in the foot if they didn't do this anyway.&quot; </p>
<p>'Starting April 2018, all new iOS apps submitted to the App Store must be built with the iOS 11 SDK, included in Xcode 9 or later. ', &quot;In that email, the company also announced that all new apps submitted from April 2018 onward must be built with the iOS 11 SDK and must support the iPhone X's new display.&quot;, &quot; Eventually, though, you can bet that Apple will require all app updates—changes to existing apps, not just wholly new apps—to support the iPhone X. That's going to cause more of a scramble in the development community.&quot;</p>

They first made it easy to get apps on the app store so people could buy them. More money for them. Now that the iPhone X is not selling well, I think they're pushing for the apps to be more iPhone X friendly to people feel left behind and start buying the phone.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think lower than expected sales numbers for the &quot;iPhone X&quot; (god if it were any other company Apple fans would be mocking how stupid that name is.) Has largely to do with skepticism about the new user interface. A lot of people don't feel comfortable using it in the store. </p>
<p>This could be an opportunity for Apple to backpaddle on their mistakes, fire all the diversity hires in their offices, and make an actual good phone OS without two devil horns cut out of the screen at the top.</p>
<p>Then push the new SDKs. Pushing the SDKs now when older apps already work perfectly fine on the new phone punishes their developers. Who already are being shackled with less than ideal development machines to work on with the MacBook Pro. Which is really just an overpriced consumer laptop.</p></div>
