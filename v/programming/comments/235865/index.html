    <div class="md"><p>Really? Just stop for a couple of days. Experience is valuable in years, if you don't touch a computer this weekend, you won't lose anything. Sooner or later, the fun will come back. I know it can be difficult to enjoy free time from personal experience, but not spending every minute you have on improving yourself is fine, too. Just think what 70-year-old you would say if you forgot living because you focussed on refactoring code.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I know how a lot of people don't like to see links from Reddit, but I keep a couple of motivational pieces around for myself whenever I get bummed or burned out on anything. Maybe you can make use of them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>My favorite piece of motivational advice (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af">Reddit link</a>, <a href="https://veuwer.com/i/2s6n.png">Veuwer alternative link</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH0nP4NzS9M">Youtube link</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My personal advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do something productive every day. It doesn't matter how little it is, so long as you can get yourself to do something, you're still making progress.</li>
<li>Take breaks for yourself whenever you need them. Exercise, mindfulness, or even meditation can all be good approaches to stress relief.</li>
<li>Get enough sleep and don't try to binge at learning things; it'll make you burn out faster, and you won't retain the memory as well. Short periods of effort every day over a long period of time will always trump heavily focused, short-term effort. Neuroscience has backed this for a while now, and you can take a brief class about it <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/info">here</a>.</li>
<li>If nothing else works, you might want to reevaluate your intentions and goals. Things may have changed, and you may have subconsciously realized that you'd rather be doing/learning something entirely different.</li>
<li>Most of all, don't hate yourself or feel guilty over it. I've been there plenty of times, and it's never worth it.</li>
</ol></div>

<p>Fuck motivation. it’s a fickle and and unreliable little dickfuck and isn’t worth your time.</p>
<p>Better to cultivate discipline than to rely on motivation. force yourself to do things. force yourself to get up out of bed and practice. Force yourself to work. Motivation is fleeting and it’s easy to rely on because it requires no concentrated effort to get. Motivation comes to you, and you don’t have to chase after it.</p>
<p>Discipline is reliable, motivation is fleeting. The question isn’t how to keep yourself motivated. It’s how to train yourself to work without it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this I'd say make morning and evening routines. Usually what I do in the morning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As soon as I get out of bed I pray then meditate. The purpose of the prayer is to think of all the ways I have it good. I have people who love me, I earn enough to provide for my family, I do something I enjoy every day. I then take a few minutes to clear my head, think about nothing. Then I meditate. It's really just holding still in a different position where I focus on what I want to accomplish for the day, in the order I want to do it. Think about what it will take to accomplish it all. But don't get hung up if I don't accomplish all of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eat a good, healthy, breakfast. Lately it's been raisin bran with banana cut up in it. Find whatever works for you, but make it good for you. Try to get in proteins, eggs are a good source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shower and get dressed in clean clothes. This is important for me because I work from home. If I'm in the mindset of &quot;going&quot; to work, then I am far more productive than if I hang out in what I slept in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take 30 minutes in the morning to learn something unrelated. <a href="https://www.chesscademy.com">Chess Academy</a> is what I've liked in the past. This kind of activity helps you warm up your brain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I actually get to work. The days I stick to my routine are orders of magnitude better than when I don't.</p>
<p>In the evenings, at a given time, I brush my teeth, wash my face, then lay day in bed. To get myself to wind down I think about my day and what I accomplished. Reflect on what I meditated on that morning. How much did I accomplish, did I not get it all because of external forces or did I screw it up by not being disciplined enough. Focus on the good, and it usually helps me do better the next day.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I take a few days off. When I can't take a few days off, I find that if I have a rigid schedule it helps and I don't feel guilty about not coding. For example I can take off at three pm, and I will, even if I am mid line in the code. Also something that helps burn out is I set a timer for 25 minutes at a time, when it goes off, even at mid command I just stop working for a few minutes.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you're really at the start of a real burnout it's like your mind just can't take it anymore, and it's something that needs to be like that for months and gets worse as time goes on, with productivity much lower than used to be, and so on. You can do other unrelated things but feel almost aversion to the activity causing the burnout. And it's not just lazy or normally tired or whatever, those are different things.</p>
<p>Been through that this year. In my opinion what you can do is rest from coding. Take some time off, and I mean even a month or so if needed be.</p>
<p>I understand not everyone can do that because you have to afford a living but I think it's either at least taking it easy or just staying unproductive and perhaps getting even worse as time passes, and if you're like me also getting into a bad mood because of it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Drugs. Not hard ones mind you. And not 100% of the time. If I find myself hitting a road block, I turn to drugs.  Not the best advice I know... But you asked what I do. I don't suggest anyone else do as me necessarily. But yeah, Provigil is pretty good for that, or Adderal slow release.</p>
<p>I like the video game suggestion tho. Could be that I program game stuff but I don't think that'd work for me lol.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the same way. Im currently working on a summer project web application and I'll work on it solid for 3 days and then lose modivation for up to a week. But I get the same guilty feeling when I don't do anything for those days. I have not yet found a way to force modivation. I just go spend alot of time doing other things especially outside and it seems everytime I naturally regain modivated.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If I can, I take a break. When I can't, I look at this quote--I have hung up on my wall: &quot;Try to do some BAD work, the worst you can think of, and see what happens, but mainly just relax and let everything go to hell. You are not responsible for the world. You are only responsible for your work. So DO IT.&quot; (Sol LeWitt in a letter to Eva Hesse) There's also a great <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=hqZAxLqJkzA">video</a>.</p>
<p>Or set up a reward system--one small candy for each task, or something similar.</p></div>
