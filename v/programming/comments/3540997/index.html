    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I'm happy to hire people like you.  In fact, I often prefer to hire people like you.  I might pay you less than market rate until you prove your worth, but I'll let you get your foot in the door.  
</p>
<p>When I interview a dev candidate, I don't care about their formal education.  I ask them about their knowledge stack and (most importantly), I ask them what they did last Friday night.  The answer I'm looking for is for them to show me their github account and show me the code they are working on for some personal curiosity / personal development project.  
</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't go for the corporate jobs.  You won't get past the stupid HR idiots.  (We are small enough to not have a HR department in the hiring process ... so you have engineers and devs directly filtering candidates.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show up at your local co-working place.  Find your local tech community.  Rent a desk for $100 / month and start working there as much as you can.  If you are in a vibrant location, then lots of hiring is done in the break room.  If you are remote and don't have access to a technology community, then put yourself out on indeed, etc. Either way, make sure your linkedin profile is perfect.  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python is good, but not enough.  If you are artistic, focus on front end tools. If you are strong in math, focus on dB and back end dev. Node JS is very useful.  But, never be about the language / tool.   
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn't matter the project, just start writing code.  If necessary, work for free on open source projects in your spare time until you have the chops to charge for your time.  (1000 hrs of free dev work on some open source project is still far cheaper - and more valuable - than a university degree...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even after you get your job, never assume you've &quot;arrived&quot;.   Take the same spirit that got you this far and realize how much more you need to learn.  There are always new tools and stacks to learn.  The day you stop learning is the day you've retired.</p>
</li>
</ol></div>

</blockquote>
<p>This isn't to hate on you, specifically, but I absolutely detest this attitude.</p>
<p>Do you expect car mechanics to tinker on their vehicles at home? Are HR people expected to be constantly socializing and improving their networks even while off the job? Accountants should be humming away as they spend their Friday nights doing double-entry accounting for their checking and savings accounts? Doctors should be doing some kind of back-alley thing, offering consults and surgeries and shit on the side?</p>
<p>I'm a software dev as my day job, but I am more than just my occupation, and have plenty of hobbies and interests beyond that. And honestly, after spending ~40 hours a week slinging code at a job that I pretty much hate, the last thing I want to do is come home and <em>write more code</em>. I would much rather cook a decent meal, work on my dnd homebrew, read a book, or even sometimes just go get fucking hammered. If nothing else, I'd rather at least make an attempt at being <em>social</em> on my Friday evenings, and try to meet interesting people.</p>
<p>I aim to try to keep my skill set current, but I do that by reading papers and articles and shit (I'm an AI/ML specialist with an MS specifically in the field, though my current position has nothing to do with that, hence why I hate it), and tinkering with it during slow periods at my current job. I'm not going to spend the time, energy, and resources to set up a Hadoop cluster at home, because (1) I'm not interested in blowing that kind of cash for a side project, and (2) I don't have a reasonable use-case for a significant chunk of my skills, in terms of personal projects.</p>
<p>This whole thing of ignoring peoples' education and work history because they don't have an active project on the side is irksome, and seems to be something unique to software devs (I imagine that more... artsy jobs probably get hit with it as well, with the whole &quot;portfolio&quot; thing, but not being an artsy dude, I'm not familiar and can't speak to that beyond speculation). Expecting software folks to have... what is basically an obsession with their profession strikes me as incredibly unfair and pigeon-holing us, in terms of personality. If you <em>want</em> to talk about the advances in, uses, and drawbacks of various contemporary approaches to artificial intelligence over a beer, I'm definitely game (and would much prefer that conversation over, say, the latest events in sportsball). But expecting me to have that kind of project going on in my back pocket, and not giving me the time of day if I don't? <em>Fuck</em> that noise.</p></div>

You know what they do when they get home and spend their free time on? They make video games. Some people just <em>live</em> for shit man. Nothing wrong with a job being just a job but there's nothing wrong with making it more than that as well.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>This isn't to hate on you, specifically, but I absolutely detest this attitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No worries.  My reply was something that wasn't targeted at a more experienced dev like yourself, but I'll attempt to reply in good spirit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you expect car mechanics to tinker on their vehicles at home?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. 100%.  I expect someone who is young and green and wants to be a great car mechanic to have a hobby project or two.  Heck, even most older mechanics who really love what they do have a hot rod they are working on in their garage.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are HR people expected to be constantly socializing and improving their networks even while off the job?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm more focused on the technologists here, but yes.  Someone who's job is networking ... and who is good at it ... will always be networking.   
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>after spending ~40 hours a week slinging code at a job that I pretty much hate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, to be frank - I wouldn't want to hire you.  This is <em>exactly</em> why I care about that question.  :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would much rather cook a decent meal, work on my dnd homebrew, read a book, or even sometimes just go get fucking hammered. If nothing else, I'd rather at least make an attempt at being social on my Friday evenings, and try to meet interesting people.</p>
<p>though my current position has nothing to do with that, hence why I hate it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly - really does sound like you are in the wrong role.  I'm not saying that you aren't good at your job.   But, shit ... life is too short to do something you hate for the majority of your waking life.  My first job out...  I absolutely hated and wanted to quit my profession.  I took a new job and realized that it wasn't the job I hated, but it was the employer / situation.  After that first bad job, I've loved every bit of my work.  Maybe you should look at the same for yourself?   
</p>
<p>AI/ML is hot right now ... no reason why you can't take a jump and find a better fit before you completely burn out.  Life is too short man. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not going to spend the time, energy, and resources to set up a Hadoop cluster at home, because (1) I'm not interested in blowing that kind of cash for a side project, and (2) I don't have a reasonable use-case for a significant chunk of my skills, in terms of personal projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course.  And a neurosurgeon shouldn't be preforming surgery in his weekend from his garage.  My specific advise was to someone trying to get into the field ... not someone who is experienced in the field.  (But, more on this below...)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This whole thing of ignoring peoples' education and work history </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Education, yes.  Work history, no.  I didn't say that.  :)   
</p>
<p>Education because our 4 year universities mostly suck at teaching how to be a good dev.  Teaching technology + creative problem solving isn't easy and doesn't bend well to the 4 year education model.  
</p>
<p>But, if you have 5-10 years on the job, I wouldn't be asking you the same questions I'd be asking a new graduate or someone without a degree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expecting software folks to have... what is basically an obsession with their profession strikes me as incredibly unfair and pigeon-holing us, in terms of personality. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are being a bit myopic.  Anyone who is <em>really</em> good at their profession will have an obsession with it.  Sales guys are always selling.  Good marketing guys are thinking about how to market their products 24/7.  In my current role, I work heavily with a marketing team ... the number of 3AM brainstorming ideas on slack ... the creativity and obsession ... it never turns off for these guys.</p>
<p>But - to be frank - this is mostly related to the creative minds.  Engineering / software devs / marketing / writing / etc.   
</p>
<p>To your point - we don't <em>really</em> want pilots / surgeons / dentists / construction workers / etc. to be &quot;creative&quot;.  We want them to be process oriented.  So ... I don't really expect an experienced pilot to be thinking about new and exciting ways to fly a plane at 3AM.   
</p>
<p>So, is this pigeon-holing?  Maybe ... but creatives and non-creatives are different creatures and have different skill sets to offer the world.  Putting a creative in a non-creative roll is just as bad as doing the opposite.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to talk about the advances in, uses, and drawbacks of various contemporary approaches to artificial intelligence over a beer, I'm definitely game (and would much prefer that conversation over, say, the latest events in sportsball).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely!  I look for passion like this in my teams.  Not because I'm 'rah rah rah' pro company, but because I'm <em>slightly</em> smart enough to understand if I align your passion with my needs, then amazing things can happen.  
</p>
<p>... And, now imagine you are actually getting to implement (and improve on) these AI approaches.  Shame on you AND your employer for having you in a role that isn't your passion.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But expecting me to have that kind of project going on in my back pocket, and not giving me the time of day if I don't? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>See, this is exactly where you are wrong.  If I was hiring you (someone who isn't green and already understands what they want) ... I'd buy you lunch and a beer and we'd talk for as long as we wanted about ML / AI.  I read the white papers, but I'm FAR from an expert in this field ... it would be my joy to soak up a bit of your knowledge.  
</p>
<p>And, in all of this ... I'd figure out where your passions where and what you really wanted to do.  If I could (a) figure out what you are passionate about and (b) align that to the needs of the company ... then I'd offer you a job.  Otherwise, I wouldn't but at least we enjoyed a nice beer together.   To be frank: offering you a job in an area that isn't your passion does a disservice to me and a disservice to you.  
</p>
<p>Cheers.  :)</p></div>

<p>However I have read your response, and want it known that I am of the opinion that it is solid and well-reasoned. I appreciate your candor, and it is quite deserving of a solid response when I can manage it (ie, not now).</p>
<p>Only thing I want to say right now is that I was led to believe my current role would be much more AI-focused than it is. I was basically catfished, which is part of why I am so frustrated at the moment.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately what I've learned is the whole interview / job offer process is a game, and you're very likely to be catfished, and even if you are, it's something your next employer might look at and say &quot;well if you're dumb enough to fall for that, why would I want you?&quot; I agree with mostlyfriendly's sentiment that you want someone that is passionate about their job, but those are hard to find and it's hard for honest people to fake that enthusiasm. </p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend staying in a work environment that doesn't suit you, while at the same time remembering that not everything will ever be perfect and you have to adapt to situations and people if you want to get ahead.</p></div>

<p>If the candidate says &quot;I like to go bowling on fridays&quot; and you're like &quot;omg he's not coding 24/7 no hire&quot; that's your problem. But I'm sure instead you ask other similar questions until you know if they like what they're doing code wise or not.</p>

<p>...that's fair. Being in the midst of actively searching for a new job, I've seen this kind of attitude before, directed at me. The whole hiring process right now is completely fucked, and I'm tired of getting passed on in favor of pajeets who will work for peanuts and produce absolute fucking garbage, or being told &quot;you don't have enough experience&quot; when these ignorant fuckwits ask for 5 years experience with a technology 2 years old.</p>

<p>You can <em>drive</em> a hot rod when it's finished. What the hell am I supposed to do with ~5 TB of data and a neural net specifically tuned to it and a particular problem? Besides, at this point, in my free time, I am more interested in focusing on the aspects of the problems of AI that aren't related to the coding bit. Writing the code will be the easy part. What the actual fuck does it mean to <em>know</em> something, though: that's (one of) the real problem(s).</p>

<p>And, to be frank - I wouldn't want to hire you.  This is <em>exactly</em> why I care about that question.  :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I appreciate your more detailed explanation here, it really sounds like I wouldn't want to work for you anyway. It seems to me that you think people need to be single-minded to be successful, that they are dedicated to one thing and one thing only. That's just... insane, honestly.</p>

<p>This is absolutely true.</p>
<p>I've been thinking, the past few years, that the issue here is that programming is a trade. You can be a solid coder without necessarily understanding the underlying theory, if given guidance and not expected to design things right off the bat.</p>
<p>I've also seen complete fucktards fail at their job despite having supposedly years at experience. I don't know how you manage to keep a job as a coder for years by failing constantly, but... here we are, I guess.</p>

<p>If I'm not getting paid for the time, I'm not doing a single goddamn thing for you (&quot;you&quot; being my employer, not you specifically). I have to constantly stop myself from thinking about work while at home, because of that approach, but I'll be fucking damned if I give you anything for free. This is how I earn my bread: why the fuck would I give that away for nothing?</p>
<p>If you're going to pay me the same as Bob who sucks ass at slinging code and has to constantly ask me basic-ass questions, why the fucking <em>fuck</em> would I give you <em>even more</em> of my time? It's bad enough that you're getting someone significantly more productive and knowledgeable for the same rate as you get idiot mouth-breathers.</p>
<p>Not only that, but there is such a thing as work/life balance. As I've said, you seem to have this approach where you think that people who are really good at a thing are <em>only</em> interested in that <em>one thing</em>. Maybe that's true for lesser minds, but fuck me if I'm going to focus my brain on one thing 24/7. I'd go fucking crazy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, is this pigeon-holing?  Maybe ... but creatives and non-creatives are different creatures and have different skill sets to offer the world.  Putting a creative in a non-creative roll is just as bad as doing the opposite.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is absolutely pigeon-holing. As I've said, it seems to me that you think that &quot;creatives&quot; need to be solely focused on their one thing, and only on that one thing.</p>
<p>That's... basically the <em>definition</em> of pigeon-holing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... And, now imagine you are actually getting to implement (and improve on) these AI approaches.  Shame on you AND your employer for having you in a role that isn't your passion.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was told the role would have AI, and that - and the ~30% raise - got my attention. Showed up and haven't had dick to do with AI since I got here, including watching the whole hiring process for some fucking intern who got sent to our AI lab.</p>
<p>Why is the AI specialist not at the AI lab? I dunno, and I've stopped asking that question because these idiots clearly don't care. Instead I just quietly started applying for jobs again.</p>
<p>So take your &quot;shame&quot; and kindly shove it up your ass. Maybe you live in some fucking metropolis where jobs just fall out of the sky, but - unfortunately - I live in the shithole that is the American south, and that seems to have tainted my resume to some degree. And as I mentioned earlier, this industry is full of HR fucktards who would much rather hire some pajeet than a white guy who actually knows what the fuck he's talking about.</p></div>

<p>Mostly unrelated, but this line here is the essence of what I used with my employer to get a significant raise - and that I was fully willing to walk if they didn't give it to me. Life's too short to not be appreciated monetarily for what I do.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.  
</p>
<p>There is a whole subculture of co-working spaces.  Shared work spaces for technologists and like minded independent (non corporate) people.  (This mostly just applies if you are in a +500K larger city.  Smaller cities are hit / miss.)</p>
<p>Bottom line: If you want a technology job, and you don't want to work for a large corporate employer, then you've got to go hang out where the employers are.  80%of my hires in the last 2 years have been through networking and the local tech community. I have open recs, but I don't bother posting jobs on monster.com / etc. Those are a waste of time for the most part.  
</p>
<p>Most larger cities these days have technology clusters. Especially relating to the start-up or so called 'gig economy'.   Many have co-working spaces for like minded technologists.  
</p>
<p>The largest if WeWork  (wework.com), but there are many others.  Some are vibrant communities, some are dead.  It's hit / miss.  
</p>
<p>I did check WeWork pricing and for a desk is $350+.   So, more expensive than my $100 ... sorry, hadn't priced this in a couple years.  Spending $350+ for a desk is too much.  I can't recommend that.  
</p>
<p>There are cheaper alternatives:</p>
<p>- Start attending meetups in the area.  Networking is key.   Meetups are often free.  
</p>
<p>- Find if your local 'startup incubator'.   Look at their social media pages for networking events, etc.  Or just go talk to them.  
</p>
<p>- Some smaller co-working spaces are going to be cheaper than WeWork.</p></div>

<p>I would never hire anyone who even stepped foot in such a place. You owe your client a duty of confidentiality. Showing their trade secrets on a screen in a public space is illegal and marks you as a traitor.</p>
<p>Oh? Everybody is doing it? So what. If you want to work for a mom and pop shop, fine. Turn traitor to your clients. But if you want a real job, secrecy or GTFO.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Good code is good code. Yes - there are tools / stacks that employers will need you to know.  But, for someone without any 'real world' experience, being able to talk about your personal projects is very powerful.  
</p>
<p>I know a several very good programmers who got their start by writing utilities / patches for games when they were younger.  
</p>
<p>The formula is pretty simple:</p>
<p>1. You observed a problem.  Something that impacted you or others.  
</p>
<p>2. You were curious and creative enough to figure out a way to solve the problem.  
</p>
<p>3. You had enough discipline and motivation to actually put some work in and solve the problem.   (This is the hard step, most people get stuck here.)  
</p>
<p>4. You are capable of communicating well enough to explain the above to your community / friends / etc. </p>
<p>Do this and you will be able to demonstrate significant value.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus fucking christ I hate people like you. I have met so many of you shitheads in my industry, or what's left of it, that I have almost no hope of things getting better. This is also some of the FUCKING DUMBEST advice I have ever read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Show up at your local co-working place. Find your local tech community. Rent a desk for $100 / month and start working there as much as you can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what absolute fucking morons and hipsters do. Paying to go rent a desk just to &quot;socialize&quot; with other morons. Do NOT do this, nobody who runs any kind of successful business will be hanging out at this place. period. Hell anyone who is a successful programmer will not be sitting there on their own dime working remotely. This is the tech version of writers sitting at coffee shops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Node JS is very useful. But, never be about the language / tool. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a valid reason why C devs make more then fucking server-side-js aka nodejs devs. If you just want a &quot;job&quot; and nothing but a job then fine but language is important. To pretend otherwise is a boldface lie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1000 hrs of free dev work on some open source project is still far cheaper - and more valuable - than a university degree...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new trend must be the fucking dumbest thing to ever happen. 1000hrs on some random github &gt; 5 year university degree. Shut your fucking stupid mouth. Yes there are very talented coders who never went to university but the exception does not make the rule. It's funny if this was engineering/medicine it would be inconceivable to hire some &quot;self-trained&quot; employee but programming with it's painfully low bar of entry lets everyone who is a &quot;javascript engineer&quot; and &quot;html programmer&quot; bleat about how gifted they are.</p>
<p>This is some stupid stupid stupid advice but the kind you read from shitholes like hackernews, a reddit-tier feel good circle jerk.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I’ve gotten my last three jobs (over the last 11 years) on the skills I taught myself. </p>
<p>In fact, when I was challenged by one interviewer who haughtily asked: “Can you do this job?”, my response was: “I taught myself to code, out of boredom with games, at age 9. I released my first game at 11. Just a few years later I was gathering analytics on the game from players and using the data to improve the game. Since then I’ve learned Pascal, ADA, Cocoa, C, some C++, HTML, CSS, Perl, some Python, and I’ve currently settled on JavaScript. I worked in the Apple core OS team, and helped to design an enterprise level data and analytics machine. Ya, I think I can do this job and I can make you a lot of money while I work here.” Dude was astounded and I got the job. </p>
<p>In another case I was asked to write a procedure which would iterate through an array. I asked them if they’d care to review the 12,000 lines of code I’d just written that week, many of which iterate through massive arrays. </p>
<p>In short, yes. And I don’t do github.</p></div>

<p>I wound up writing a function which iterates. It was hilarious. This snot nosed kid kept trying to correct me and all he did was show his ignorance. I didn’t want to work there and told them so and left. Was pretty funny.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone with many years and world class credentials in tech, I agree. Coding is not taught in universities. It shouldn't be, in a sense. There's so much that one can only learn by working on BIG projects. All the stuff you learn in school is supposed to be fundamentals, but when you are hired and forced to work with legacy code consisting of millions of lines of spaghetti, none of that background is all that useful.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  Try to find a company that does a coding test as part of the interview.  Mine has implemented that (largely at my urging), and it's been a godsend compared to who we used to hire before.</p>
<p>We'll regularly interview half a dozen 'programmers' with CS degrees who can't even write FizzBuzz let alone get to the real problems.  How they lasted at prior jobs I'll never know.  We end up hiring whoever can actually do the job, whether they're self-taught or college educated.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone that I hired in my 40 year career started out very young in learning electronics and computers.  What I like to see is someone self-taught as a teen and then having gone to some type of pipeline training. The people that did not have any post high school training did not do as well as those with vocational training.</p>
<p>The people that decided that they wanted computers and electronics in their second or later year of college were useless.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've been a professional developer for almost 15 years now.  I've worked with a hundred folks over the years.</p>
<p>Only about half of them had a degree.  Of those with a degree, only 1/3 had a degree that was related to tech in any way.</p>
<p>Hiring managers have come to the realization that credentials mean next to nothing these days.  Also, a Computer Science degree means you have met the requirements for a degree in Computer Science.  Programmers are not doing Computer Science, they are programming.</p>
<p>A Comp. Sci. degree isn't worthless.  I value mine because it gave me a solid, mathematical foundation to venture into math-heavy topics like machine learning and quantum computing.  But it's by no means necessary for day-to-day programming tasks.</p></div>

<p>Projects now are made up of many people working together. Get involved in a bigger open source project and learn how to add/fix things without breaking something else. Learn how to understand something that came from someone else's mind. Or minds. Learn to disagree then drop your ego to go along with the consensus.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you need help building your portfolio to show off to potential employers, you could try something like upwork or other temp job sites where you can do smaller projects for people. I'm not sure how far along you are, but I used this method when I was proficient at translating but not great, because it cuts out a lot of the filters that a purchasing department has, since the jobs are smaller or need to be done quickly.  And if you're still learning, sometimes you can find a job that isn't as time sensitive and learn as you go and get paid to do it. Later on when I finished school I outsourced some of my day to day work to a python programmer and some other data analysts and offered to give one a job recommendation.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Possibly at a startup, but your pay could vary widely.  Unfortunately most big companies won't even take you into consideration.  If you are serious then get a bachelor's degree in computer science.  You can work as an intern while going to school.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I did it. I started off with working fixing computers at a local small business and literally worked my way up from at home IT support, to medical IT support, to big business IT support from there to doing application development at the same company and eventually getting to the one I'm at now.</p>
<p>That pathway is a bit unique to me I think, but in a general sense, work experiences and those open source projects (no kidding my 2d evolution game was cited as something that made me stick out to the new company) can and will take you the distance to a well paying programming career.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Should I lie on my resume?  I put 'self employed' but wonder if that screws me.  Legit thinking about just making up a company to lie about working there. It sucks how hard it it, I get auto disqualified for these jobs, and I put key words in them.</p></div>
