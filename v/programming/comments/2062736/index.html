<p>Coding for kids is wildly popular with educators, politicians, parents, the tech industry, and people who run coding camps.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn't say know how to repair or maintain a car. I said build a car. Knowing how a computer works from a basic level and operating software, even as a power user, does not require programming knowledge. You might think it is lazy AF but having spent 25 years as a programmer I can tell you most users want to do their non-programming related job rather than learn to program. Computers are tools for users to enable them to do their job or make it easier. Adding programming to that mix is a waste of their time (and everyone else's for that matter) because they will either not learn it or worse still build Rube Goldberg-esque software contraptions that become hazards to all who come in contact with them. I'm all for people learning things but programming for non-programmers is not necessary. Do you know how to spin, weave, sew and alter textiles/clothing since you wear clothes? As an engineer I'm sure you have knowledge of the concepts but that does not make you a tailor/seamstress and neither should you be expected to be. I'd rather people learn skills that actually translate to everyday use for them like cooking and managing money. That is what we need to teach kids.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analogy there then is more akin to be being able to solder up a half adder or somesuch, not programming. The programming is the &quot;driving&quot; (to stretch the car analogy), and when Billy No Skills proudly sums a column in his Excel spreadsheet, he is, in a fashion doing rudimentary programming. Unfortunately he's only able to drive in ways which have been imagined by the car manufacturer.</p>
<p>I'm an engineer that spends a good portion of his day writing software - from bit twiddling to PLC code to GUI front ends in several different languages. My background is actually in CS, so I'm not completely clueless (in case you were wondering).</p>
<p>If you can't at least do the most basic of programming, then you can't really make your computer do what you want it to - but that depends on you wanting to do something other than share pictures of your dinner on Facebook, balance your chequebook (showing my age too, there) or surf for porn, so on that we both agree. Not everyone should be forced to learn to program, but anyone who owns a computer should be able to command it in a reasonable fashion - being by Python or Bash script, or whatever Windows comes with (I guess Powershell or batch files). If you don't know the first thing about basic security and how computer programs work, you're a liability to the rest of the computer using community and should buy a fucking tablet or something.</p>
<p>On the subject of amateur programming horror stories, I'm not saying anyone else should use them! I have suites of little scripts and utilities that are of the &quot;get the job done&quot; variety that I'd be horrified to show a programmer because they're just for me, and I don't have a problem with people who do that and actively encourage it. Incidentally, some of the worst code I've seen is that written by professional programmers! </p>
<p>TL; DR What i'm saying, in summary, is that empowering people to really use the machines they own involves more than using it like a fridge, and a more personally empowered society is a better one. And a good proportion of professional programmers suck balls at programming.</p></div>
