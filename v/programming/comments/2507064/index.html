    <div class="md"><p>I liked C when I used to code in it exclusively.</p>
<p>I've writen a ranking based on size-growth fronteer.  C still wins over Java because it is growing so much faster and I fucking hate Java.</p>
<ol>
<li>java, c  
</li>
<li>c++  
</li>
<li>python, sql (sql is apperently turing complete)  
</li>
<li>c#, visual basic .net  
</li>
<li>php  
</li>
<li>javascript  
</li>
<li>ruby, visual basic (not sure what makes one .net)  
</li>
<li>delphi/object pascal, R  
</li>
<li>assembly, PL/SQL (also not sure what that is specifically)  
</li>
<li>swift, matlab  
</li>
<li>perl, go  
</li>
<li>objective-c</li>
</ol>
<p>So one thing I would like to do is make C development closer to javascript (I do node).  I'd like to see a cpm equivalent to npm.  Conan.io is nowhere close.  And I'd like to see more popular http libraries that either take advantage of theading or hyper-threads/async.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if someone were to just rip npm and give it a new default public repository and host npmjs.org at cpmjs.org if the end result would be at all useful in the context of c.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I know, the Tiobe ranking is based on search engine term popularity. The <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2018/03/07/language-rankings-1-18/">Redmonk ranking</a> has a somewhat different way of ranking, based on both GitHub projects and StackOverflow ranking, which seems a little bit more reliable (though might favour projects that tend to reside on GitHub and penalize projects that tend not to be hosted on GitHub or not being hosted publicly - which might well be the case for many/most embedded projects, which I would assume includes many C projects).</p>
<p>I could imagine that there are not many new projects started in C, outside of embedded programming at least, and that it was mostly just maintenance that happened in C. I once heard that C++ for some period at least had an increasing share of embedded programming, though C still has the advantage of being much, much, much easier to create compilers for than for C++ (I do not know if LLVM changes that to some degree given its architecture, in regards to embedded).</p></div>

<p>Tiobe claims that it is based on the number of people employed doing it.  So they probably just give people questionairs asking what languages they use at work.</p></div>

<p>Of the four or so indexes I've found they are the only one to claim any connection to number of professionals using it.  All the rest also factor in search engines except the github only indexes which I trust even less.</p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to scale the factors of the index.</p>
<p>Edit: Well fuck.  That really is an unsubtanciated claim on there.  <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/programming-languages-definition/">https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/programming-languages-definition/</a><br />
