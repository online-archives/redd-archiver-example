<p>The problem is that nobody takes the time to comment on it. I am guilty of this behavior myself. I have often played games in development and then not bothered to give my view. So I understand, but it leaves me in a bind.</p>
<p>The few people that do comment tend to be outliers. They are not 'typical' people, so feedback from them may point me in the wrong direction. The ones who are most likely to respond are the ones who love the game and have nothing but good to say. Which is nice, but does not help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very true. Something I am aware of, but it was good advice for you to point out.  
</p>
<p>It's actually a very complex thing learning how to 'interpret' the feedback in a useful way. I'm become somewhat proficient at it in contexts where the feedback was mandatory. Often I find that the information the user stresses the most can be the least valuable, and sometimes it's the things they don't say that tell me the most.  
</p>
<p>But all of that is worthless unless I have the feedback first.</p></div>

<p><strong>IT MUST BE OPT-IN ONLY.</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise what is a debugging tool for you becomes spyware for them.</p>
<p>I don't know if this would give you the feedback you're searching for, but it might help in any case.</p>
<p>One additional thought - let people know their opinions matter.  There's an MMO that I am on that had a very large change.  I didn't comment on these changes, though, even though I had ideas, because I felt that nobody was going to listen to me.  Considering how much response I got from other feedback I've sent in, I was probably right.  Replying to feedback may help with this, or at least, would make it somewhat more likely that someone who gave feedback once will give additional or more detailed feedback in the future.</p></div>
