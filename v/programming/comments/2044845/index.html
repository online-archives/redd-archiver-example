Some get stuck with beginner tasks that they never get to deploy their application to production. Some who make it do it by endlessly grinding through tasks, often with unnecessary repetitions.</p>
<p>For a very long time now, I have learned that there just aren’t that many advanced courses out there that cover from the basic application through deploying it to production. As a person who has been coding since I was 12, I know how important it is to master the right curriculum to become a legit full-stack developer. You really don’t want to spend too much time dwelling on a problem and sometimes, having the right guidance matters.</p>
<p>I’m sure many of you have heard of Wistia or Vimeo and the like and may be using some of these services. They work tremendous, with a ton of features and analytics. Sign up for a Wistia or Vimeo account and you pretty much have little to worry about anything video hosting, aside from integration.</p>
<p>That said, the costs can run up quite a bit. With Wistia recently having their Pro plan go up to at least $99 a month, I knew it was a no-go for any new startup, well most certainly not for mine and so, I sent an email to them requesting if I could get the previous pricing model. “As far as our pricing model goes, the only plans that are fully customizable are our Premium Plans, which usually come with high volumes of video or marketing integrations.” was part of what I got from a guy named Aaron Damesek. Sure, I thought to myself and I vowed to solve this video hosting problem myself.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, I’m working heavily on my startup and guess what? I have successfully created my own media processing platform on the Amazon S3 cloud storage service and I couldn’t be happier. Less cost plus I know what exactly is going on. For the critics out there who are thinking perhaps this may not necessarily be such a great idea, given the high stress load placed upon the web server itself, hear me out. I know it is not easy but believe it or not, these companies operate on the same idea. They too rely on open source tools and have web servers that do media processing and I just had to figure out a way to make things commercial-grade and highly scalable and boom, you create something you never thought you would.</p>
<p>It certainly helps that I love what I was doing too! I just launched a Kickstarter campaign for a feature-rich course where I’ll teach interested backers how to build an advanced online video education platform similar to udemy so if you’re interested, don’t forget to check it out. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1918703657/learn-how-to-build-an-advanced-online-education-pl/">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1918703657/learn-how-to-build-an-advanced-online-education-pl/</a></p></div>

<p>The biggest reason why this is is because it is impossible to educate good coding to other people that simple lack the brainpower to learn it. I give an example to this AGILE/SCRUM madness. They try to convert code monkeys into big coding masters by giving all these rules and guides and design patterns. And they wondering why their sprint fails yet again. Good developer are good because they say f*ck you to guidelines and invent their own out of pure creativity.</p>
<p>If you want to educate people then educate them to trigger their developer creativity in finding solutions where none have gone before. Don,'t teach them how it is done nowadays because I have never seen so bad programming in my career what I see in the last few years. People have forgotten how to create good code, all they do is copy code monkeys and useless crap without asking if there is no other way.</p></div>
