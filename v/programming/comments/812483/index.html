<p>SJW are just Marxist, it's why the left all share similar attack styles is due to the origin of Critical Theory. It's  complete and utter bullshit and it's an attempt to redefine the values of western society (freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of expression, due process, etc etc). </p>
<p>They are the biggest bigots and racist in our culture, think about it the only people that are <em>constantly</em> bringing up race/gender/sexual orientation etc are the SJW.</p>
<p>Also look into Pragmatic language and how they abuse the trust relationship when having a conversation. You can see it in the Opal thread with <a href="https://voat.co/user/meh">@meh</a>, he was under the impress that they were all having an open discussion with everyone attempting to understand the other party.</p>
<p>SJW don't do that, they abuse that trust to get people to give concessions.</p>
<p>NEVER EVER APOLOGIZE TO A SJW, from the Internet Aristocrat (I love Jim) </p>

<p>conservative social and political thinking (not to be confused with hard right hyper conservative politics) generally attract lots of very capable, very rational people from all walks of life, where as pseudo liberalism (not to be confused with all left leaning groups / people) tends to attract people who are not so capable or rational and think they have something to gain by reordering the world to specifically favor certain groups over others in the name of their brand of &quot;equality&quot;. </p>
<p>Its not all the surprising someone with an intellect and bucket load of wit while also happening to be gay can see though the horse shit (narrative over facts) that the fake progressives try to force feed everyone.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree with you on that and thank you for expanding the point.</p>
<p>By definition Classic Liberalism is a conservative ideology, which is something I just found out recently but absolutely falls under the definition.</p>
<p>What we are seeing now, imo, is because the left has move soooo far to the left that they are now attacking centerist as being 'right wing' and fail to realize that the bulk of their support comes from these people.</p>
<p>Centerist are starting to rally together and resist this bullshit and it's lovely to finally see and participate in. It's about god damn time the center woke up to far down the rabbit hole the left has gone.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this pernicious trend can't be dealt with by increasing the number of labels between you and the individuals doing it... it's basically hiding from it to start talking about SJW this, Marxist that in response to something an individual has done.  Particularly if you maintain a FOSS project that only holds together by general consensus.  The people around the maintainer are only there because they can get utility from the project, otherwise their outlook on everything else is unaligned with the maintainer.  Strongly rejecting these claims without discussion (especially in the form of replying with derogatory labels), even though they are clearly divisive and made by people who don't use or contribute to the project, can weaken the maintainer's position since he's herding cats in the first place.</p>
<p>I guess it means explaining why their assumptions and claims do not apply, but that's an uphill battle if a mob piles on in a small project, that is maintained in someone's spare time.  It's pretty nasty.</p></div>
