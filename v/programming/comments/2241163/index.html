<li>they obfuscate simple tasks</li>
<li>hive mind uses x framework because they think it makes them leet. If everyone drinks the koolaid who will be left to argue?</li>
<li>regular javascript works exactly the same and you could spend your time mastering that instead of some dipshits idea of what good code is</li>
<li>patterns that get used enough on a website CAN be reinvented at significantly lower cost in time, file size, and maintainability than using a framework. </li>
</ul>
<p>So I can give you a 5kb website with no bullshit that will be readable in 10 years by anyone who knows JavaScript. ...or I can use something like Angular 2. ...Jesus ...Fucking ...Christ</p>
<p>I cannot even describe what a pile of dog shit that framework is. You use a command line tool to add classes. The whole thing is done in typescript. They add so much shit like <a href="https://voat.co/user/decorators">@decorators</a> that it doesn't even resemble javascript, they do shit like this ...and if I were a teacher and one of my students did something like this I would smack the shit out of them</p>
<pre><code>&lt;li *ngFor=&quot;let foo in bar&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Its like they just do whatever they want. Its like a kid with crayons. Its exactly what I would have made if I were trying to demonstrate bad design.</p>
<p>Web development is infected with some kind if weird mental disease. I do not see it getting better. I see myself getting out.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations! You are now a seasoned programmer!</p>
<p>The anger you are feeling towards frameworks and trendy web bullshit is normal once you cross the line into being a seasoned (or salty) coder. You have recognized that this over-reliance on frameworks is complete insanity and you would be better off just writing your own lightweight and purpose specific code instead of including eight frameworks and dependencies, a convoluted tool chain and right-out-of-the-box obsolescence. You still have a couple of major tests to overcome on your road to greatness though: 1.) abstaining from making your own framework that works the way it should and 2.) resisting the urge to try to convince the less experienced coders that you're right and they're wasting their time. If you can avoid banging your head against these walls and instead just making things work the way you want them to, then you will grow a long, gray beard and will basque in the glow of your own enlightenment. You're on the golden path now. Follow it with confidence, my son.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason I learned react was to try it out and make a web app, but I could've build it myself in the same amount of time it took to learn this convoluted bullshit. Granted it does bring some nice features to the table when you use things like redux, but I'm already sick of JS tbh. Gonna head back to java / c++ after I'm done with this bullshit</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Tools are there to help you build something. The central problem is that people are using a sledge hammer, or a nuclear bomb so to speak, to build an about page. If you need a heavy tool like Angular or similar, then you need it and it's useful. It will get you to your goal. Recently I've found that Vue/Vuex are awesome. If what you need is a static page that basically is a spaceship it's fantastic.</p>
<p>If you've got a full backend, with REST and html processing without a massive amount of movement on the page you don't need it though. It just depends what you are building and what you need.</p>
<p>I hate it when I load someone's stupid programming blog and it's 20MB of Javascript. It looks stupid as hell. Hopefully recruiters start catching on to this instead of thinking it's impressive some day.</p></div>
