I've done a bit of programming in the past, so I have a general idea when it comes to arrays, loops, classes, constants, variables, inheritance. Basically, I want to be able to get solid fundamentals to write write clear code that adheres to industry's standards.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to do Angular or React, definitely learn JavaScript. JS benefits from ubiquity and seems to keep wending its way into more application areas. The language has its weaknesses but I don't find it particularly egregious compared to most other high-level (sloppy) languages.</p>
<p>Algorithms and data structures do not depend on any particular computer language.</p>
<p>I also recommend you learn C.</p></div>
