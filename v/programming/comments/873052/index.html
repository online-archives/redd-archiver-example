      <div class="md"><p>It's just a frustration I've found dealing with companies I've applied for. They don't care about a programmer's understanding of the concepts involved, they latch on to marketing terms like Câ„¢, C++â„¢, Javaâ„¢, Javascriptâ„¢, C#â„¢ and so FORTHâ„¢. Of course, that's simply not enough, so they have to throw frameworks and toolkits into the mix too: Node.jsâ„¢, SQL Serverâ„¢, MFCâ„¢, .NETâ„¢. Everywhere I go, I also see programmers talking this way too, they use Schemeâ„¢, Haskellâ„¢, etc. </p>
<p>It seems to me as if programmers have become more interested in pimping products than discussing programming concepts. When and why did we become salesmen? Why do we do this to ourselves? If you want to become a truck driver, no one asks you whether you have experience in Freightlinerâ„¢ or Peterbiltâ„¢ and hires you based on that. They know the concepts transfer. But at some point in the 90's, it seems to me, we became product-obsessed and adopted the identity politics of branding. I'm no longer a programmer, I'm a Câ„¢ Programmer - so now if someone wants to hire me, then I have to look for Câ„¢ programming jobs. If I apply for a Javaâ„¢ programming job, they'll turn me down because I don't have experience in Javaâ„¢ - doesn't matter if I have the skillset to implement the Java language myself. If you're not wearing the correct NASCAR patch on your uniform, you're wrong for the job. These products used to be selling points for a company, now they've become buying points for a programmer.</p>
<p>It just makes me wonder: as the products unfold into thousands of them are we going to reach a point where no company can hire anyone because no single person meets their product checklist? It's becoming fucking ridiculous. The one sense in which I can understand is if the languages have fundamentally different concepts, but that's usually not the case. Haskellâ„¢ is conceptually very different from other languages, but even then why can't we just pull out the concepts instead and see if the programmer understands those? Do you understand OOP, procedural programming, functional programming? Do you know what a linked list is, a hash map, a BTree? Do you know how to write an event handler?</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, it's so fucking frustrating seeing this shit everywhere and I felt compelled to get it off my chest.</p></div>

Programming is becoming more complex so that while you may understand the concepts, different languages and frameworks can also have different tools and IDEs and ecosystems to pull snippets from.  Companies are used to getting exactly what they want and they'd rather not wait even 2 weeks getting someone up to speed with the ecosystem before they spend 6 weeks getting them up to speed with the code base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is part of the &quot;rock star programmer&quot; appeal of the profession. Programmers have been in such high demand for so long, it has attracted a lot of inexperienced folks who want to get a foot in the door. If you want to be a literal rock star, you have to already know how to play your instrument, you can't go in all like &quot;Well I studied music theory for three years and I've been playing the guitar for 3 months&quot; and expect to get recognition for your knowledge. You can't <em>want</em> to be a rock star, you have to simply <em>be</em> a rock star, and of course some people are better at assuming this attitude than others. You can't be willing to <em>learn</em> a new framework on the job, you have to <em>know</em> the framework, even if that just means you've been reading a bunch of blogs can make smart remarks about the latest beta features - &quot;I am really looking forward to dynamic threading in the next release, it is going to make things so much easier!&quot;</p>
<p>Also I find it strange that people now place an emphasis on the difference between OOP and procedural programming. They are orthogonal to each other. Declarative versus procedural is more meaningful.</p></div>

<p>Personally, i couldn't care less what something is programmed in. If it runs and does the job it's intended to do... fair game. Alot of experienced programmers can maintain a codebase in a language they've never even learned, all it takes is logic and hacks until you become familiar with it. But hey, that's unprofessional -- can't be unprofessional now can we, better go put on my suit and sit down for a nice plate of node.js.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Having programmed Node.js applications for cloud, Node.js addons for another application, and just plain old POSIX C programs for embedded devices, I can tell you that Node.js does a lot of things right, and I have so much more appreciation for standard API that Node.js provides now that I've coded in C and had to re-implement some of those functionalities.</p>
<p>Node.js does allow a lot of higher level abstractions to be installed and used relatively painlessly, and the accolades it get isn't just from the HR people - originally they are from the frustrated devs who switched to Node.js and found out that it's super effective at going from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>HR people eventually saw the productivity and figured, if Joe Hacker can pump out functional code with Node.js, why not every Tom, Dick, and Harry? That's why it's now over-hyped.</p>
<p>So, please don't be too hard on Node.js. It's not the framework that's bad, it's the un-enlightened people who think Node.js is the panacea for all development woes.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no while the generlized skills transfer there can be significant differences between languages. Differences which can take weeks or even months to become aclimated with. Weeks and months that can be very expensive for a business. A new employee is already a monetary risk. A new employee that does not actually have the skills you are looking for but has some very similar skills. Thats a more significant monetary risk. Its perfectly understandable that they dont want to waste all that money for you to learn a new language on their bill.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>For any higher level position I disagree, the specificity is logical:</p>
<p>These days you are hiring into a position the person is probably stuck in for the duration of the 3-5 years they are going to be at your company and you are going to be paying the rate that is their current salary plus whatever increases they didn't get at their last gig.</p>
<p>You can hire someone that works in the toolchain you work in, save on costs because their time getting up to speed is lower, and they are more likely to write something your existing developers are going to follow, or you can hire someone with a solid background, spend time teaching them, and lose time when your other developers encounter their early attempts which look like their last framework's top ideas ported crudely to the toolchain you use.</p>
<p>You get to keep the person about the same time either way, but the second situation gives you less return on investment, and there are plenty of candidates to choose from so why not make the selection that gives you more results for similar expense?</p>
<p>On top of that, some of the concepts, while possible to implement in various languages are very much the wrong way to do something in certain languages for low level technical reasons.  It started with the C vs C++ crowds, spread into the various flavors then outward into new languages as they developed with the various compilers/runtimes being built with different assumptions.</p>
<p>I know what a binary tree, hash table, linked list and event handler look like in many languages, I have implemented them in many, but I  also have many years of experience on when to avoid them like the plague in my chosen language and enough sense to know that even if I learned a new language to the point I was fluent in it I couldn't legitimately demand the same pay as I can in the language I have more than a decade of experience in.</p>
<p>What I do see is in the lower tier of dev jobs they are posted the same way as the more senior jobs.  This I agree is a probably a bit unnecessary as almost all Jr candidates are useless right off of school, but the market isn't tight enough to post even Jr positions as no experience needed, and if you are going to ask for experience you might as well ask for related experience as those candidates are out there.</p>
<p>The other factor at play in the REALLY specific job postings is large organization politics, or god forbid: unions.  If a manager's grade is determined by the number of staff they manage keeping an open position open lets the manager keep their position and meet budget sometimes.  Other times having a position that cannot be filled provides the justification to bring the rest of the department's rate up to market levels.  
</p>
<p>Companies with union dictated hiring rules are the only companies I have ever observed actually &quot;unable&quot; to fill a position due to the checklists, and even that isn't that common, but we did have a couple local employers that would post things like Level X platform Y developer with Z years experience where Z was 3x the number of years Y had existed.  I applied for some of those initially our of school assuming it was a mistake only to find our from the hiring manager that all employees at level X require Z years of experience since their last collective bargaining with the mechanical and electrical unions.  I had no relationship with the union so I could only respond that I had worked in that platform since z/3 years ago when it was initially released and the hiring manager apologized for wasting everyone's time.</p>
<p>That position remained posted until the company closed all of the local locations and reopened several states away with no union the year before Z years would have actually been possible.</p>
<p>I am sure there are people playing games with it for H1B purposes as well, but at least in the geographic area I work in, most companies that were going to try that route already did, many learned their lessons and are already pulling back from it.  From what I have seen, the level of fraud in the overseas universities and technical schools is going to solve the H1B problem faster than legislation will everywhere except for possibly the west coast.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It is very annoying. My personal theory is that recruiters are laze and instead of trying to figure out if you know programming or not, they just count how many libraries you have used in your projects. People are collecting libraries like they are stamps. They are also following libraries like they are fashion trends.</p></div>
