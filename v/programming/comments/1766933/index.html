<p>These boot camps/courses don't teach you anything! All they do is teach you to think in a predefined way and once you have hardwired you brain to think like that, every single project you develop will end up in near-failed projects. The sad part in this is that you won't realize that your project is that bad. You can't know since you never developed your creative brain that this project can be done way more easier and elegant.</p>
<p>Kick out these courses and invent your own technology. Use that creative mind, become a top developer instead of a code monkey.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've never taken &quot;boot camps&quot; or video-based programming courses, so I can't speak about them.</p>
<p>To be honest, when I went out of college, I thought that I knew how to program. But in retrospective, I didn't know that much. And my code was certainly not of the highest quality. I learned to program well in my first few jobs.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the same applies to &quot;boot camps&quot; or online courses. You learn the basics. You might think that you know a lot, and that you're good. But you really learn how to code in your first few <strong>real</strong> jobs.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that boot camp students overwhelms the good developers to a point where the good developers are outnumbered and replaced. So when you get rid of the only people that can Tapdance around your complete team and still end up delivering a working project then no one can call these people out anymore that they are doing it all wrong.</p>
<p>Right now I see this process happening at a client where I work. The good developers already started to jump ship, I am probably next. The last thing you want to be associated with is a project that will end in massive failure. Very bad for your resumé.</p></div>
