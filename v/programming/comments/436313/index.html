<h2>Rule change: No drama submissions</h2>
<p>As many of you are aware, drama submissions <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/405911">have been banned</a>. However, I want to use this moment to point out that <strong>politic submissions</strong> are <em>allowed</em> to allow for discussion on those topics without turning into a echo chamber. Some may have noticed that I lifted the ban on those in the last minute.</p>
<p>I'd like to add that we know that it's not always easy to distinguish between a politics/political submission and a drama submission. However, we think the friction this may raise is worth it. So, if you ever post a submission and a mod removes it as rule violation noting drama, and you think it's unjust, please get in touch with us. Easiest way is by replying to the Mod's deletion reason comment.</p>
<p>To serve an example, this is a <a href="http://matthewhopkinsnews.com/?p=2030">political submission</a> (Still allowed), this is a <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/371436">drama submission</a> (banned). One of the main differences between those submissions are that the first one discusses the issue, while the latter is just a link with an inflammatory title. It's a hard topic and the lines what is what <em>are</em> hard to distinguish.</p>
<h2>New moderators!</h2>
<p>In the same sticky I called for applications for moderators of this subverse. Many applied, for which I want to thank everyone again for their work and desire to help out! If you've missed who got the job, <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/425949">here's the sticky for that</a>. If you're wondering who's the head mod: That's me, as in, <a href="https://voat.co/user/Craftkorb">@Craftkorb</a>.</p>
<h2>That's it!</h2>
<p>Enough of me. See ya. Sticky till Sunday evening UTC+1 :)</p></div>
