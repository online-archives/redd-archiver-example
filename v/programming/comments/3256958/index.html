    <div class="md"><p>Last job I was a sys admin for one application, and ran about 5 ticket queues for sub functions (same system, but a platform that extra stuff could be built on).  We didn't have a developer team left, so I was running source patches.  Excessively low level stupid questions: Every fucking day.  As my boss was a diversity hire, as was my coworker I did fucking everything.  I was on call 24/7 but that stopped about a year before the job ended.  Clients were shit at planning new features and maybe 1:20 ideas actually fell into contract.  QA servers were shot to shit, but system was to complicated to mirror.  Testing team, hahaha, no just release it into the business and fix shit when it didn't work.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I am currently working on something that will end up in two distinct pieces of software (call them &quot;apps&quot; if you will) one of which has a couple of flavours, all of which are sold/licensed.  I am not support, thank god.  I don't even do support for open source software any more.  There is no QA team and each one of us is expected to do it but usually most of it ends up on the boss' shoulders.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Usually one, except fixes/refactoring across components. A huge problem are key developers who end up in key positions for more than one project at a time. Extra points for brinkmanship for bosses who schedule the same deadline for such projects. Failure is more or less guaranteed. Still common industry practice in my 'hood.</p></div>
