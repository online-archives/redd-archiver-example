<p>Anyway, at what point, even though the code is already unrecognizable and <em>serves a different purpose</em> than the initial code - would you feel comfortable breaking the GPL?</p>
<p>Say, notwithstanding simple formatting changes, that 15% of the code was the same. What do you think?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That's really a moral issue, I think.</p>
<p>You are taking somebody else's work, changing it to fit your needs, and branding it a new product. Do you actually consider it a new product, or is it the original but 'tweaked'?</p>
<p>It's, to me, kind of like reading somebody's book and saying 'Meh. The plot was ok, but I think I can do it better.' As long as you're only recycling bits and pieces...</p>
<p>It's a slippery slope, though. If 15% is the same, maybe include a commendation or something to the original program? 'Built on blah blah by blah blah' or something?</p></div>

<p>Either way the bottom line is original work isn’t created by copying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I decided to build the project from scratch without copying any code.  I mocked up my app in their framework  and then started from scratch with widgets from my own toolbox. I am 2 days in and probably 50% done.</p>
<p>Anyway not just because of your opinion but also because I didn't like their code layout. It was useful as an outline and especially for mysqli usage which I haven't used in a complex app before.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations.  I believe building from the ground up is always better because of what you learn and the problems that arise make you better. Anyway I know you didn’t do it for me, I’m just some asshole online- but I’m still happy for you for not copying work.</p></div>
