    <div class="md"><p>Programmer's second favorite saying &quot;The wonderful thing about standards is that there are so many of them from which to pick!&quot;</p>
<p>Programmer's favorite saying &quot;It works on my system&quot;.</p>
<p>In answer to your question though -- if we </p>
<ol>
<li>assume you mean a windows computer</li>
<li>HAVE THE ORIGINAL INSTALL MEDIA and any key that came (usually printed) with it</li>
</ol>
<p>Then yes. It is all but certain you can install it on a different computer later.  CPU serial number linking never became a thing at all except at the EXTREME high end.</p>
<p>HOWEVER!  And this is a very big however.  With rarity exceeding even the CPU serial number linking, it is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to MOVE software from one windows based computer to another.</p>
<p>Virtually ALL of the instability, creeping slowness of computers as they age, and just general funkiness is ALL caused by the thrice damned and barely functional &quot;Windows Registry&quot;.  From a computer science viewpoint it is a catastrophically bad design that would   get you FLUNKED OUT of any reputable university.  It sole and entire purpose is to make it technologically all but impossible to pirate software.</p>
<p>So, for the privilege of micro$oft treating you like a felon, you get a slower, less stable computer that gets a little worse every single time you install ANYTHING on it until, unavoidably, it becomes so terrible you go out and buy a new computer.  Whereby M$ gets another $100 and the entire process starts all over again.</p>
<p>Windows 10 has made this entire fiasco 50,000 times worse.  If you ever actually read the license you would have to be insane to actually run this spyware on you computer.  
</p>
<p>Linux is of course the OS most zealots recommend.  But finding and configuring a PC that will run it is beyond the scope of what the average person can do.  The main reason for this is because the Windows license fucks over the manufactures (Dell, Lenovo, etc) WORSE (if that is possible) than the end users.  So don't blame Dell.  It is practically a contract violation for them to even sell a PC that doesn't have windows installed.</p>
<p>Your best bet at present is to buy an Apple computer.  A vast majority of mainstream windows programs are available on Mac and those that aren't have reasonable substitutes.    Of course Macs are VERY expensive. Some of that is justified (the build quality is FAR superior to a PC company), some of it is not ($400 for a memory upgrade that you can get all day long for a PC for $150).</p>
<p>And Apple are not saints of course - except compared to micro$oft.  Then yes.  They are officially guarding the gates to heaven.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Normally, you license the use of the software, what hardware you put it on is immaterial. Some licenses (like Adobe), allow you to install on two devices, as long as you only use them one at a time.</p>
<p>Also, there are other software that requires a license for every CPU core, so you can't just make a blanket statement about it.</p>
<p>On top of this, if you don't uninstall correctly, you can violate the validation method of some types of software and then you have a headache trying to reinstall it on something else.</p>
<p>It pays to read the license.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This is barely related to programming, but I'll still try to explain a few things that others haven't. Your question is vague, so my answer will be broad with the aim of giving you a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>If you buy software, you are buying a license to use it which can be sold to you under various terms. You may have bought only one license to install the software, then you wouldn't be able to transfer it. Some software you buy allows you to install it on multiple machines. Software can also be free and then you are allowed to install it on as many machines as you like. It all depends on the fine print in the license that most people don't read which can later on bite them in the ass...</p>
<p>That is the licensing side of things, but then there is also the technical side. Often commercial software will have measures in place to prevent you from simply copying it to another PC, for example it will require you to login to an account, or require activation with a code. Collectively, all these sorts of measures are called digital rights management (DRM). It can enforce some of terms stated in the license. DRM-free software is software where you can copy the installer on any compatible machine to install it without restrictions. DRM-free software can be paid for, for example GoG.com sells games like this. DRM can sometimes prevent a user from accessing software they paid for. For example what happens when the server to check for an account doesn't exist anymore? Access denied.</p>
<p>Since it sounds like you are on windows... If you want to move software between PCs, usually you will need the installer for that software. If you have it, just copy it over and run it again. If you don't have it, you will need to get it again from the website of the software distributer. For most programs on windows just copying files around won't work because of the registry and because you don't know where the installer put stuff anyway. Discovery and distribution of software on windows has always sucked and involves tediously searching around on the internet. Too bad microsoft have such a strong foothold, yet is so shitty.</p>
<p>Apple is even worse, you pay them extra to get fucked good with weak hardware for the price and even worse lock-in. </p>
<p>Linux can be shitty in its own special ways, but is still worth learning with all the free software (libre office, gimp, VLC, etc.) that typically goes along with the OS.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Office comes with different kinds of licenses, so you need to check what you have, then redownload the installer, run it and enter your product code. <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_other-msoversion_other/copy-move-or-transfer-an-office-installation-to/956244a0-385d-4e21-a21e-87b4179111d1">Here is microsoft's how-to.</a> If it turns out that you have a no no transferrable license, I'd recommend ditching MS Office and using <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">Libre Office</a> instead, so you will never have to deal with the licensing bullshit again. Libre Office isn't quite as nice, but it's free and it can do almost anything that MS O. can. It just takes some getting used to, prepare to spend some time looking up how to use it.</p>
<p>With steam you can actually back-up a game installation to an eternal storage device to save yourself from downloading it again. Then you can restore the game from your new PC. <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8794-yphv-2033">Follow this guide</a>. This backup feature doesn't back your game saves. You need to copy those over seperately, check where the location of savegame and config data is on <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tekken_7#Game_data">pcgamingwiki</a> put those files in the same directory on your new PC.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the document format, but <a href="https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/149777/current-compatibility-between-libreoffice-and-ms-office/">generally they are compatible</a>, except for some weird edge cases. If all your documents are .doc .docx .xls .xlsx, mostly everything should work. If something doesn't work, open it in MS O and save it as .odf which has the best compatibility.</p></div>
