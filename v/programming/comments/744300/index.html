    <div class="md"><p>It really doesn't matter what sort of problems you want to solve. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming it's pretty easy to go from one language to another. My language of choice is currently C# which when I was able to jump in and start using immediately even though I'd never read anything extensive about it before and had never used it before. There used to be a pretty big gap between imperative languages like the &quot;C&quot; family and functional languages like Haskell or Lisp but now a days the biggest languages, like C#, have started to even take some of the handy concepts from functional languages and bring them on over.</p>
<p>Anyhow if you ever hope to become particularly competent at programming it's going to turn into a love and so the exact language you start with doesn't really matter - you'll devour everything. This question is kind of like somebody who's never played baseball before asking if they should start out by learning a curveball, a fastball, or whatever and somebody responding &quot;Well what sort of batter are you pitching to?&quot; Just get to playing and see if you enjoy it before getting into the esoterica.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a tic-tac-toe game in javascript/html, a todo list app (like everyone else) with jQuery, some crud apps in Meteor that were used at work, and now backend Python restful apis that will be consumed by mobile apps. I learned a lot from every project, I think the important thing is to make as many small projects as you can and evaluate them to see how you can improve. What types of projects you take on will determine what type of programming you'll be learning.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm writing a game in C++ (no link because this is my say-stupid-shit account) and having a blast learning about graphics programming, matrix math, shaders etc. It may have been a better business decision to use something like Unity or UE4 but I'm finding there are advantages to doing things on a lower level.</p>
<p>For instance, game engines tend to dictate what kind of scene graph you use, and handling that stuff myself means I can load larger, more complex levels and have them run well because I know my own requirements better than a general-purpose engine ever could.</p>
<p>The trade-off is that it takes ages, and you have to deal with bullshit bugs at layers you don't really care that much about. Like, input will stop working for someone and you have to find out why and fix it.</p></div>
