    <div class="md"><p>Software engineering is a term used to describe all the planning that goes into developing a software product. Kind of like a rough draft, sketch, recipe, roadmap for the development of a product. It makes sense for big projects. Typically it involves describing all the functions and making class diagrams etc. that fulfill the specified needs of a customer or manager (who are usually also involved in the process).</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>gah, its gets a little semantic here.
Not all engineers are programmers (like Mechanical Engineer, for example).
and not all programmers are programmers depending on what you mean with that word.</p>
<p>For instance, there are jobs with an &quot;engineer&quot; title, which require in depth programming experience, but where you would not actually do the programming directly yourself, instead you sort of carve out the work for &quot;lesser&quot; programmers to type up. </p>
<p>There are also IT Engineers that do no programming at all. Some of these might do tasks related to networking or security.</p>
<p>But I would say that all software engineers are programmers, when using the word &quot;programmer&quot; to mean &quot;they make programs&quot; even if they aren't the ones directly typing it up themselves.</p>
<p>I do designing of systems and I do programming too.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>IT engineers are definitely not programmers they basically stay on the scripting side while programmers tend to go deeper into compiled languages. </p>
<p>But I have to say that modern programmers, those have more and more deteriorated into script kiddies. They can't invent new technology when they need to, they rely on frameworks created by others. They have become very good at &quot;name that framework&quot; but very bad in what real programmers do: &quot;Cheat&quot; to by pass restrictions. </p>
<p>It is shocking to see that very good programmers have deteriorated into average by this SCRUM madness. The winners mentality has changed into the losers mentality where no one cares anymore if the sprint succeeds or not.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think that the 'engineering' is being used as a synonym for 'science'.  And the science part comes in if one can analyze algorithms according to their logarithmic run-times.</p>
<p>Many people learn software languages perfectly fine without knowing that.  
</p>
<p>Now, if someone can actually create a software language and/or design hardware that can execute software, I would expect that individual to be classified as an engineer.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Countries handle this differently, the word &quot;engineer&quot; in many is a legal term which often America ignores. Even in Canada you can't just call someone an &quot;engineer&quot; without a very specific accreditation. This is a mistake many software developers make on their resumes too, in case you are applying for jobs outside of the US.</p>
