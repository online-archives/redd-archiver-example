<p>I've been wanting something similar to this for a long time. </p>
<p>Imagine a world in which even composition can be available to anyone, simply based on sound rather than theory. Decentralization of composition is at hand. Well done!</p></div>

<p>Man, this is absolutely amazing! I guess this is how (approx) Shazam and co works. </p>
<p>So, if each of these &quot;notes&quot; could be treated as entry in what used to be a .MOD or MIDI files, but I believe you would need to create a library of sounds for the latter. Hello old-new compression tech ?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I had been looking into music transcription a while back when toying with MATLAB back in the day, but simply didn't have the appropriate programming skills to use another language that would compile to something more user friendly. </p>
<p>What did you use to make this programs, what sort of libraries/extensions? Also, as far as algorithms go, what's the general flow of it? Read in the input and break it into the frequency domain and use visual tools to map them to the spectrograph? Feel free to not answer (or keep things simplified without detail) to protect your IP. </p>
<p>Finally, what's next for your project? Music transcription directly to music writing software like Sibelius or whatever composition programs people are using nowadays to make musical arrangements? Or are you looking to enter that space for yourself? </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I developed the algorithms in python, which is great for fast, iterative development. Then I re-wrote it all in C++, using Qt to decode audio, but I didn't use any 3rd party libraries on the algorithm side. The spectrogram is a variation on the Constant-Q transform (<a href="https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Brown91-cqt.pdf">Brown, 1991</a>), so instead of the Fourier transform, which has linearly spaced frequency bins, the frequencies are spaced exponentially, like the human ear. Finding the notes from the spectrogram is surprisingly challenging, given how easy it is to pick them out using your eyes and brain, and obviously there's still a lot of room for improvement on that side.</p>
<p>I tried to integrate it with MuseScore notation software. If the user has that installed on their machine, it will open the result in MuseScore. In the future I'd like to improve the accuracy of the note detection part. That's the area that could use the biggest improvement.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, I have to say I'd never heard of the Constant-Q, I'll have to read up on it. I ran into similar issues trying to translate frequency to notes. It's definitely ambitious as a project and I'll be keeping tabs on it. Good luck. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, you can see a couple examples of accuracy on the home page. It generally does pretty well for slow-medium tempo instrumental songs, but not as well for fast songs with a lot of percussion/distortion. It creates a MusicXML file, which can be directly converted to midi, so it should be possible to play in Guitar Hero, assuming they use MIDI files.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If it has trouble with fast tempo, is it not possible for it to slow down the track for analysis (making a record of how much it slows it down by) then as a second-pass speed up the result?</p>
<p>I'm quite a noob when it comes to musical theory, so that might be a silly question.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>That's a good idea, but the challenge is separating notes from other stuff like noise and drums. Really short notes are harder to separate and in order to slow down the tempo, you either need to stretch out the drums and noise as well (which means it's still just as hard to separate them) or figure out a better way to separate them before you slow it down, in which case you've already got the better separation before you slow the tempo.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow! The program looks amazing! I tried using it with the opening piano lick to &quot;Feelin' Alright&quot; by Joe Cocker, and the result was, well, nothing like the song. :( There are bongo drums and another percussion instruments at the beginning that may be throwing it off... <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/584pue9yauaj2hd/feelin%20alright.ogg?dl=1">Here</a> is a link to a small OGG file I used to test it with.

    <div class="md"><p>That's interesting. Thanks for the feedback. I looked at the clip and it's a pretty simple song, which I would expect the program to do a decent job on. In the visualization window, I can see the main notes (C, G, Bb) at the beginning. But I can see a lot of partials from the bongo drums that are probably being mistaken for note harmonics. Bass drum is easier for it to ignore, but the bongos are semi-melodic, so they kind of look and sound like notes and the program gets confused.</p></div>
