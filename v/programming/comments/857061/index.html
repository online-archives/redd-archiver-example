<p>Oh, there were some competent ones (as good as the worse male programmers  at the company), and a lot of really bad ones (that would never have been hired if they weren't women), but not ONE good programmer. Not ONE programmer you could say had passion, wrote inspiring code, was excited to see some new form of data structure or programming idea.</p>
<p>In decades of professional programming, and decades of (private tutoring) teaching, seeing many many both male and female programmers (admittedly, mostly male), not a single good female programmer. But many many good male programmers and a lot of excellent programmers.</p></div>

<p>my experience, it's not necessarily an intelligence problem but rather a passion one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Exactly!</p>
<p>I remember when C++11 just came - I was so excited! I send all my free time (at home!) playing around with the new language features. I was reading about it for years before - when it was still C++0x - almost getting a boner about the auto and new for feature, and trying to wrap my head around promises and futures. And I wasn't alone - for months, all we talked about at work was this new thing or that new thing in C++11, and how we would write things differently, and how SFINAE works, and what we could use it for, and how we would change the codebase to take advantage of the new features and... and... and we were legitimately excited. Like the hype you get before a new video game / movie / whatever comes out.</p>
<p>Female programmers? No. They just &quot;OK, this is a new thing I need to learn. Hopefully I can just continue to work as normal&quot;. Not one looked like she would spend her free time excitedly reading anything she could find about the new features. They work, they go home, and at home they don't think or care about programming.</p>
<p>That's the difference I see.</p></div>

<p>Yeah this is what insults me about the whole thing.  It is part of the male condition that some of us spend our coming of age years doing geeky things instead of working on how to get laid.</p>
<p>When I first heard that any woman thought that there were social structures that discouraged women from programming, I thought back to how my parents let me have the old family computer in my bedroom, while my sister got nothing.  I thought for a second &quot;Huh, maybe it was unfair ... maybe she would have benefited from having the computer.&quot;  And then I quickly realized, -- &quot;Oh-- she would have just gotten herself into all kinds of trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>My sister is incredibly smart, but of course she couldn't resist the life of a normal young woman.  She was always a bit jealous of my skills, of my talent when it came to playing guitar and writing music, and being funny.  But I was always a bit jealous of the fact that she dated way more successfully and so on.  It is just the condition of being the genders that we are.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, we had one (the only) female in my class. Professors literally said: &quot;we'll let her pass, because we don't get much girls&quot;. We were doing Pascal the first year. Code, the only code in that whole year that she submitted was <code>Program Hello;</code> and she did not just passed, she passed with a good grade. I don't know what happened the next year, because I was gone.</p>
<p>But, oh my, how dispassionate, even hateful her attitude was. And entitled, and not ashamed of her special treatment at all. I can't imagine why she enrolled at all, perhaps she knew that that school goes easy on girls. Horrifying to imagine she'd finish her education (I mean, that they let her pass all the way to the end), and then seek work in this field, and be hired because of some quotas or something.</p></div>

<p>There is no impartial automatic way to measure the quality of a code commit.  It could be an entirely cosmetic change, or it could appear large because of some light refactoring that was easy to perform.  Commit size and pull-request acceptance rate won't even begin to tell you what you're seeing.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've been a professional programmer for 15 years now as well as a published computer security researcher.  I've worked extensively in both academia and the corporate world.  In that time I've worked with about a dozen of female programmers.  Of that pool the vast majority were just as competent as the average male programmer with a very few being exceptional.  In my experience the talent distribution among female programmers is very similar to that of male programmers.  What has always puzzled me is that the best female programmers I've encountered have always been asian in origin.  I've never met an exceptional caucasian female programmer.  This is most likely to due with US immigration requirements and cultural factors. Just my two cents.</p></div>

Right now artists are using things like aruduino in their projects, many people are doing web design, etc. and each of these, even though they might not be &quot;real&quot; coding are making people much less apprehensive to seeing monospaced text in an editor. This means that we might get great female programmers at some point.</p></div>

It's the same feeling I used to get from the early Simpsons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting this article. I had read about the supposed &quot;findings&quot; at <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/02/data-analysis-of-github-contributions-reveals-unexpected-gender-bias/">Ars</a> but thought that the writer was jumping to conclusions. I'm glad to see my skepticism is shared by others.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that Ms. Lovelace was probably a great software engineer and a pioneer as a woman in that field at that time.  However a meme can get old and there is a fine line between letting people know something existed and overhyping a social equality meme that everyone has already heard until it just gets old.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking for one that actually claimed women were better programmers than men.  I didn't find one, but minutes later it popped up on google news.</p>
<p>Whatever the fuck a bustle dot com is, has this to offer:</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/2uoDY">https://archive.is/2uoDY</a></p>
<p>So the chain is:  
</p>
<p>Some non-peer reviewed thing with a secret data set measures like a zillion things.  Of all of those, one of them has a 2% thing that doesn't favor women.  That gets spun as a study that shows that men are sexist, and THAT gets spun as a study showing women are better coders than men.  
</p>
<p>Absolutely ludicrous.</p></div>
