They have to deal with what you write, good or bad.  And someday, they're going to be the people who decide whether they want to recommend you for that great opening at their new company.  So yes, important people do care about your code.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It may differ from team to team, but several I've worked on even the programmers did not much care about the code. We were invested heavily in process, like unit testing and use driven development. A primary motivator was showing that the features were actually working. The actual code was kind of secondary, so long as it was working we were okay with it. It's actually kind of liberating for programmers knowing that nobody really needs to care about your code -- I don't want somebody micromanaging details and nitpicking small choices.</p>
<p>I'm going to put a big &quot;however&quot; on this, and it's something I mention in the article as well, I'm assuming a certain base-line of competant coding and workmanship. Crap code is unnaceptable everywhere; it's also very unlikely to actually implement the desired feature. The article is a counter to over-engineered results and needless perfectionism. It's about finding a good balance and focusing on the priorities of the project as a whole.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree. I have been working on stored procedures that were written by people who were just trying to get things working. A code and fix situation if you will. There was no planning or proper testing.</p>
<p>Anyway, now I have someone helping me and they can easily modify my code, but if they have to look at the old version they're baffled as to where to start looking for how it was done before.</p>
<p>Writing careless code is a cancer in a project, and sometimes the only solution is to kill the code and start fresh</p></div>

<p>I try to get this point across at my work, we can get things done quick and dirty now and have to completely rewrite it later. Or I can spend a little extra time planning and writing maintainable code and we can use that time in the future to add a new feature.</p>
<p>I don't think students coming out of school understand how much code is just such utter garbage that it's easier to just start over and throw out the old code.</p></div>
