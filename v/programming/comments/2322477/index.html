    <div class="md"><p>Event based languages are very very useful. Otherwise you end up with while loops eating up an entire process and junk like that, Javascript is not an ideal language but is it ever useful.</p>
<p>Languages like Python you can basically just use it to write scripts, you then need another layer outside of it that is the real &quot;application&quot;, the thing that you run, but it's lower level like a bash script. That networks a complex infrastructure of shit together. Need something to run at a certain time of the day? Set a cron job. Javascript all I have to do is calculate the number of ms I want a piece of code not to do anything and done.</p>
<p>There's memory leak issues that are easy to run into coding but ultimately Es2015+ is awesome.</p></div>

I had some pretty basic questions about the system layout/design and they couldn't answer them. &quot;That guy isn't here this year&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn't actually going to give much thought as to why they'd send a DB into space. It's not like they can't just send the data back down and do temp storage in flat text files. Hell, it's like the perfect time for .csv to be used. Send the data back in compressed format it have it automatically expanded into an database of your choice. Storing it in space is just not something I was willing to try to reason about.</p>
<p>My degree is in applied mathematics, which puts me squarely in the 'I am a scientist' camp. I've been in the physics lab clean room where they were building a satellite. I'm not an expert, however. But... I'm going to say I could probably have given those kids some advice. I wonder what their lead or advisor were doing?</p></div>
