    <div class="md"><p>a minified heap of js or css is a single stream, giving your connection an opportunity to saturate for the duration of the download.</p>
<p>downloading the assets altogether without being minified would increase the amount of tcp handshaking, as well as the amount of hostname-level blocking (waiting for the previous asset from specific-cdn-hostname to finish before initiating a new one).</p>
<p>i suppose you can cope with this by tuning the client. i don't recall the specific of http pipelining re: whether it would help - i'd have to waterfall a page to see</p>
<p>but yeah thinking about it conceptually i would say minify + cdn would be the way to go - the cdn part gives you that geographical advantage, and minify lets you download one fat chunk from the cdn, without a hole lot of handshaking or keepalives going on.</p>
<p>as a side, i wouldnt recommend including publicly used stuff like bootstrap or jquery or google fonts or what have you - i'd work out automation to host the most up to date copy within your own cdn.</p></div>
