    <div class="md"><p>Crazy that you can beat a Mario level in, what was it, 8 or 9 neurons?</p>
<p>One thing I was hoping he'd touch on is how trained the neural net got to that one specific level, rather than being able to play Mario in general. If you were to take the winner of generation 34 and suddenly stick in a brand new level, how far would it get? How long would it take to train a neural net that was seeing a different level for each generation?</p></div>

<p>I would have found it a lot more impressive if it had learned how to complete the level with the most points or in the fastest time. It missed out on all the fun!</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I'd be interested in how many neurons it would need to beat a few different levels, or even to see how much of the game it could beat. Tempted to write something of my own to try and do that, or maybe modify their source.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering how smart it got after just a few hours of learning, you probably wouldn't even see a noticeable difference between a week of training and a year of training because a week of training would be so good. There was a similar research project that came out of Google DeepMind (I think) a few months that involved a similar idea, but with lots of different games for an old Atari console that I can't remember the name of. I downloaded it and left it running on one game for three hours and it became incredible at the game. I left it running some more for two whole days and it wasn't much better, mainly because there really wasn't any room for improvement after a few hours. </p>
<p>If the software in this video is as good as it looks, then there (probably) isn't much room for improvement after a week of training the model. That said, a year of training on a computer with a super fast processor would still be fun, just in the shits-and-giggles department. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, in case it finds a security vulnerability in the VM managing software (like Virtualbox or something that) and ends up going too far. It'd really need a real no-Internet-connection-at-all air gap between the Internet and the computer. But in general, it'd be interesting if Microsoft could just put a Windows box on a network and have another machine on the same network just keep trying to get in with whatever it can think of. If there's even a single security vulnerability, then it'll eventually find it, and the engineers can then figure out what happened patch it up. Given enough time, they could (hypothetically) weed out every security vulnerability. </p>
<p>This kind of thing could get really exciting! The only thing that's ever held machine learning and neural networking back from the rest of computer science is that we didn't have hardware that was powerful enough for it. Now our computers are starting to get powerful enough for it! Things are going to start getting very exciting in the next few years, mark my words! </p></div>
