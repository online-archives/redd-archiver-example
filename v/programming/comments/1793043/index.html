    <div class="md"><p>Surely unrelated activities should not be a reason to &quot;fire&quot; someone, but I think their letter uses a suboptimal argument.</p>
<p>Being <em>&quot;pro-tolerance, pro-diversity, and pro-inclusion&quot;</em> is not really a compelling argument towards anything at all, it's just more ideological chaff (and also most often the exact reason for firing someone because of activities that are not part of the job, so it would easily be turned around against them).</p>
<p>The real compelling argument is simply that endeavors not related to the project should not influence decisions concerning the job, simple as that. If the job or contribution to the project is done well, it does not matter if you are a serial killer, literally Htiler or a reptilian from outer space.</p></div>

<p>Still, the exact reason they are using against exclusion of a member now is much more often used as a pro-argument instead of a counter. And likely it will be here as well, to get rid of the project leader now...</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>From Dries:</p>
<p>&quot;In the end, I fundamentally believe that all people are created equally. This belief has shaped the values that the Drupal project has held since it's early days. I cannot in good faith support someone who actively promotes a philosophy that is contrary to this. The Gorean philosophy promoted by Larry is based on the principle that women are evolutionarily predisposed to serve men and that the natural order is for men to dominate and lead.&quot;</p></div>
