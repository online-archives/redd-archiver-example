I'm not necessarily wanting to execute them on the command line, it's just the only way I know how to do it. What am I missing? Is there a some sort of framework or environment that I need? Again, I'm very basic with Python; syntax and functions. Simply, I just want to write a basic Python program and execute it. I use i3 on Linux but I also have gnome and when I go into gnome and use the interface to click on it, it says their isn't a program to execute Python bytecode. I'm just fucking lost here.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>C and python are in no way similar. First of all, you don't need to compile Python. Just run the script. But first you need to do a few things.</p>
<p>step 1: Make sure your file has the &quot;shebang&quot; as it's first line. here is a sample &quot;Hello World&quot; program:</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python
print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>step 2: make sure your file is executable:</p>
<pre><code>chmod 777 ./filename.py

<p>step 3: execute using</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On a side note, and if you're willing to help a guy out, what's the reason for the difference? Why do I have to compile C but not have to compile Python? I guess I'm struggling with the 'why' and 'how' more than anything. From what I've heard, Python can be executed at run time. I don't exactly know what that means. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are asking these questions now, it probably means you don't have the background to really understand the significance of what I am about to tell you. The upside is, &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;How&quot; doesn't really matter. I don't reccommend worrying about the underlying mechanics just yet</p>
<p>But anyway, here are some pearls:</p>
<p>The difference is that C is a machine language and Python is an interpreted language.</p>
<p>The C compiler converts your C code into binary which your CPU can understand natively. It requires no interpreter. The benefit of this is the code is very efficient. But, you must compile a different binary for each architecture you want to support.</p>
<p>The Python interpreter, on the other hand, is compiled to &quot;non-native byte code&quot; (&quot;.pyc&quot; files) which isn't architecture dependent. That code is executed inside of an interpreter which is similar to a virtual machine. Since it is the virtual machine which runs the instructions you don't need to compile for each architecture. However, the cost that there is a lot of overhead so python programs are much more CPU and memory intensive.</p></div>
