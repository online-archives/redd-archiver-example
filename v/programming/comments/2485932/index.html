<p>i can do these things faster in a java swing program than I can here... honestly, is Unity just a crappy GUI maker or what? This seems MORE complicated than making things from scratch, at least when getting started that is.</p></div>

<p>However there's still something important I need to know for general knowledge</p>
<pre><code>player = FindObjectOfType(typeof(Player)) as Player;
</code></pre>
<p>How do I know the data type of the object I'm trying to access? I need the exact name. I see things in the object, that I made from the menu that indicated I was making a sprite object, the allude to it being a sprite like &quot;sprite renderer&quot;, but if I'm trying to use the line of code you have above how do I knew the exact name to write in there so I can find what I'm looking for? I would think it would be at the top of the Inspector, but I don't think that's right because I can type anything I want in there, including spaces. And after that I see nothing consistent between the objects that actually says the name of the object in it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so sprite's are called SpriteRenderer s? How can I know for sure when other objects deviate slightly from their menu name? Is this info not in the Inspector? I thought of simply viewing the script for the Object, but i coudln't find an easy way to do that for a script I didn't create (as those are stored in my Assets). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>also anything that has a script on it has a type of NameOfScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of the confusion I described above. I have a canvas component and there appear to be 4 object (scripts) that come with it: Rect Transform, Canvas, Canvas Scaler, Graphic Raycaster. If these are the names of the scripts how can I access them since there are spaces? Is there some convention where it defaults to the camel case of those script names? I remember someone mentioning this in a previous tutorial, but he just took out the space and didn't talk about space usage.</p>
<p>What does the name at the top of the Inspector do? Is that a unique ID for the script? As in something I might want to assign a GUID to for search simplicity? If not, is there a place I can assign something like that?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>the premade objects you add use their type as the name, so Canvas's type is Canvas. if you want to access a component on the canvas you would reference the canvas and then get the component using canvas.GetComponent.</p>
<p>as far as I can remember, the spaces will not be in the name of the type. I think it automatically removes them if you use them in the name of the script, but I can't be sure as I don't use them in the names of my scripts. I use PascalCase for my scripts and methods/functions, and camelCase for my variables.</p></div>

<p>edit: just to clarify, the components use their type as their name as well. SpriteRenderer is called SpriteRenderer in the inspector. it will be attached to an object, though, so to create a reference to it you will first need to find the object and then GetComponent from that object.</p></div>
