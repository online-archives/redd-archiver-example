    <div class="md"><p>I suspect many programmers do not read books except one of the &quot;__ in a Nut Shell&quot; series. Instead, I'd say that  the most beneficial experiences come from having a a good set of problems, both diverse and tackling. I would suggest that you get very good in at least one language and gain an ability to jump to others. Experience will tell you when to jump and what to avoid.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Except use of the Numberical Recipes algorithms is not free.  You are not allowed to you use their algorithms in anything that is distributed by source (so forget any GPL'd code).  You are not allowed to distribute binaries that exposes the algorithms (I believe the intent is to prevent someone from distributing a &quot;NR library&quot; but the wording is ambiguous enough that a bunch of other implementations could be caught).  Commercial distribution requires a institutional subscription (and must still comply with the no source code, no API conditions).</p>
<p>In general I advise all programers to avoid reading Numerical Recipes.  It's a minefield of copyright infringement and just not worth the risk. </p></div>
