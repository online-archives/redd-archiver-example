    <div class="md"><p>I saw a great point in one of the CoC comment threads that the only actionable outcome of the CoC was to exclude people.  Everyone starts out included, it's only by the arbitrary choice of being offended that forces the community to spend time debating politics rather than working on the project, and then exclude those with the minority opinion.</p>
<p>This both reduces diversity in the project as well as producing an unwelcome atmosphere where anyone is at risk of being doxxed (not even necessarily correctly) for something said anywhere else on the internet, and then denied support/access/whatever to a project because of it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen and experienced similar things in open-source communities.  Firefox and Perl (or Ruby, it was some previous stone named language/framework) are two OSS projects that have been barraged by newcomers who contribute very little effective code and tend to complain.  I'll never forget reading the Bugzilla logs for Firefox where people were actively claiming that the FF extension of .bro was indicative of a male hierarchy.</p>
<p>Meritocracy is a step in the right direction IMO, but even meritocracies have problems.  The definition of meritocracy is as follows &quot;Rule by merit, and talent.  By extension, now often used to describe a type of society where wealth, income, and social status are assigned through competition.&quot;  Meritocracy is good, but it does rely in a loose definition of &quot;merit&quot;  who has more merit?  The boss who makes a single smart decision and brings a company to the forefront of profit, or a workerman who spends 20 years doing manual labour without so much as a complaint.  Meritocracy has several divisions within itself, saying that meritocracy is the ideal society is like saying your favourite food is fruit.  Does it answer the question?  Half-heartedly, but it is quite general.</p>
<p>What people should be asking for is a technocracy (or at least that seems the best option IMO).  A technocracy is defined as: &quot;A system of governance where people who are skilled or proficient govern in their respective areas of expertise. A type of meritocracy based on people's ability and knowledge in a given area.&quot;  It is where people are allowed a job based on technical ability.  But even then, society in this aspect is better, but not perfect.  First, if a workerman is a good workerman will he be a workerman forever?  Will he ever be given a chance to prove his other skills at any point?  People should have the freedom to choose and given apt time to build their skills.  A single misstep should not cost a person their livelyhood.  Also, we need factory workers, even if they could be replaced with automated systems, a working disparity even within a technocracy lends itself to a society in which classes are brought by intelligence and specialization.  This is not bad, but think of how classes work today.  The upper escalations would remain elite while the lowers would only become more brain dead over time. </p>
<p>tldr; Give people with technical skill for a profession that profession and shut up.  Also we need worker bees and people should all be given chances, yatta yatta, SJWs are actually really bad for all things considered because their aim is to normalize humanity with respect to its lowest common denominator</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It's because it is a white-male-dominated field, and SJW theory dictates that whenever demographics are not in line with the general population that it must be caused by systematic oppression from privileged classes.  That's why tech is their favorite target because despite all their efforts it has been impossible to influence the demographics the way they want, since none of the &quot;oppressed&quot; groups actually have any real technical ability or interest, and it can't be faked or fudged like it can in nontechnical fields.  Furthermore, the tech sector is well paid and relatively respected and powerful, so that just magnifies their interest in conquering it even more.</p>
<p>The more puzzling question is why their narrative is so favored in the media.  Which to try to explain that I think you end up going down a /pol/esque rabbit-hole.  Not that they aren't right with their explanations, but it is just hard to make convincing sociopolitical arguments because it is so damned complicated.</p></div>

<p>Yeah, i'm with you on the media, then again they have 24hours to kill and only 365 channels to support, so they'll jump on anything that will get them a few hits. Also, Hillary is running for presidency, so it is likely they are trying to build a base to support a woman in the white house (not that Hillary is incompetent, you can't be where you are without doing something right. Moral, ethical etc..are all a different subject). </p></div>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So are they not aware of outsourcing in the tech industry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think with tech / STEM the butthurt is mostly about the lack of women.  Also despite being diverse in terms of lots of foreigners, I think SJW's still might not be content until there is good representation of all backgrounds.  There are very few black programmers and engineers for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They should start with taking away graduation ceremonies for kindergartners and no kid left behind. Is this the result of it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure I follow.  Do you mean that these practices are lowering the quality of our education vs other countries?  With tech, outsourcing is going to be a given because there aren't enough people in the US graduating with those credentials to meet the demand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it is likely they are trying to build a base to support a woman in the white house</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I totally see this as a factor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not that Hillary is incompetent, you can't be where you are without doing something right. Moral, ethical etc..are all a different subject</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, it ain't a job just anyone could do, making it to her level.  And that probably includes some valid and useful skills along with some unscrupulousness or sociopathy.</p></div>
