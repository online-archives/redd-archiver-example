    <div class="md"><p>Having been an angular developer since angularjs, heres my take on it. </p>
<p>I've been a backend developer developing in java or c# .net for several years. I've used anything from php to python as well. I began using angularjs to resolve a ui issue on one of my projects that did not have enough resources for a ui developer. It was easy to pick up and learn. Using angularjs and bootstrap I was able to put together a nice looking ui that was acceptable. </p>
<p>I think I learned the basics in over a weekend. That specific project got more attention from the higher ups so it needed a focused developer for the backend and front end and there was no angularjs developer on the team nor hireable because it was so new. </p>
<p>I basically supported the development of the app as a full stack developer. </p>
<p>I think being an angular developer is one thing, and rewarding from a &quot;can find a job around the corner&quot; as it is in high demand. But you make yourself more in demand by being a full stack developer. I get calls from recruiters where the preference is full stack and the pay rate seems to be better than if it was just angular by itself. Not that being just an angular developer provides bad pay.</p>
<p>I don't think angular is the next big thing as someone else pointed out. Angular from angularjs to angular 6+ now has been a &quot;next big thing&quot; for some 8 years now. Google is pushing it so it gets a nice build community and enterprise adoption. As is reactjs. There seems to be enough work around for both reactjs and angular since they have been around for at least 5+ years. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>In case you want to be somewhat focused on development, ensuring that you have a good foundation might be useful. You seem to have a bit of industry experience, so maybe something SICP might be useful, though I haven't read and worked through it myself. Then again, it might not.</p>
<p>There is also DevOps, though I have very little experience in that regard. If you like both development and operations, maybe that might be a good direction.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>First and foremost, I think it's <strong><em>awesome</em></strong> that you started with SQL. I'm not even trolling here, this is very serious. I've seen COUNTLESS applications brought to their knees by poor data schemas. When the schema is wrong, the app will <strong><em>never</em></strong> work and you will spend months chasing bugs only to find that when you solve one, three more pop up. I think that all developers need to go on a 6-month paid vacation where they spend the entire time in a database boot camp and practice normal form until it's second nature to them.</p>
<p>Now as far as this job is concerned, I would recommend passing on it. Here's my reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>Angular is a UI framework, and it sounds like you've never messed with UI. There's a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> to learn when you start dealing with UI. Everything from button placement to text size can affect how users interact with your app, and a misplaced checkbox that made perfect sense in your head could cause thousands of users to complain about lost data. You need to understand human psychology. It's definitely a skill worth learning, but since this job is <strong><em>strictly</em></strong> Angular, as you said, you won't be dipping your big toe in and acclimating to UI development at a safe pace. You'll be diving in head first, and it's very rocky at the bottom of the UI pool.</li>
<li>Angular is a web framework, and it sounds like you've never messed with browsers. There's a <strong><em>LOT</em></strong> to learn when you start dealing with web. CORS headers, AJAX, browser consistency issues, IE hacks, the horrors of data persistence (cookies vs LocalStorage vs AJAX calls to a back-end server), asset bundling, the hellscape that is modern build tools (WebPack is a sin), etc. Just like with UI, you want to wade those waters carefully or else you'll lose interest in web development for life</li>
<li>Angular, as a framework, is becoming niche. For a while it was <strong><em>the</em></strong> go-to framework for front-end dev. Then React came and blew them out of the water. It was easier to use, easier to debug, had better performance, and didn't have any weird magic under the hood. Later yet came Vue who took everything React did and, in my opinion, improved upon it. Eventually Angular completely rebuilt itself in React's image, but ever since they did they've been trying to target enterprise clients. Microsoft uses Angular. Startups use Vue.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd look for a Full Stack job. Something where you can bounce between front-end and back-end as you get warmed up to the idea. Don't dive head first into a pure-Angular job. You'll hate yourself for it.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>If I was between angular and what you're currently doing, I'd pick the angular job in a heartbeat. If you want to move to a full stack .net / java / whatever job from there it will be easier than where you're coming from now.</p></div>
