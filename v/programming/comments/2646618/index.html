<p>yeah its just problem solving at the end of the day which everyone can do but not a whole lot that are very good/fast at it. even then, there is a art/finesse to it to make the solution run well and not bog everything down.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>There is validity behind what you are  saying,  but  there  are many exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your knowledge of writing an email and your boss to understand the email is obsolete in 3 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gmail interface that  I use has been  changing  very little.  As  long as  I don't need  to change  languages,  your comments   seem  pure exaggeration.</p>
<p>As far as coding more generally, it depends upon  what you learn and what  your do. COBOL &amp; FORTRAN  are not sexy, but they have changed very little for decades. If  you have  a  background  in physics, engineering, and/or math, that knowledge  will  be unchanging and still useful for  coding.  C++ is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Unlearning per se may not be necessary, but certainly the ability to  adapt to new  paradigms is always a good  idea.  I do understand  the  comment about unlearning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the developers that enter the developers field will become burger flippers in a few years from now.</p>

<p>Obvious hyperbole, Beside, a few yrs from now, the burger  flippers will be  robots. :-)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>And it has an expiration date of only 3 years. Three years from now you won't' understand any code that is up-to-date because the language and notations has completely changed. </p>
<p>It is like losing your language ability because in 3 years from now they jumped from English then Chinese then Arabic then Spanish then Chiniglisch.... And modern days they mix languages and coding styles withing the same application.</p>
<p>If you don't have a natural tendency to figure it out all by yourself, then your career of being a developer ends after merely 3 years.</p>
<p>Good developers are not formed by educating them, good developers will automatically learn everything without ever being taught! All developers that does not have this natural instinct to self-teach and explore uncharted territories will be wiped from the work force in about 5 years.</p>
<p>Look at the speed they bring out changes in languages and technologies. Even the ones that were excited one year ago are now being burned up.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Wut?</p>
<p>Python has been around for a while and Python 2 is still in widespread use.  AutoIt is fairly beginner friend and a useful language for office work.  Then there's core programming principles, like declaring/calling functions.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't about trying to make everyone into a software developer just like reading/writing isn't about making everyone into a novelist.  Even construction workers benefit from being able to read/write.  Likewise, office workers in 10 years will be able to benefit from having a basic understanding of programming.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Your core programming principles can be learned in 1 or 2 hours. You can learn this at any moment when you need to. You keep on referring to simple &quot;Hello world&quot; applications. This is not what this you-tube clip is about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You got good instincts, but quite frankly (from reading your other posts) you need more education.   It seems to you like skills requirements are changing quickly, and its a lot of effort to keep abreast.  This is because your understanding of the foundations of computer science is lacking.  
</p>
<p>In reality, what we see is just syntactic churn.  Most of this is created to ensnare people just like you by large corporations.   They want to keep programmers inside their &quot;eco-system&quot; and ignorant about the true power of programming, that their eco-systems are unnecessary.
So, do not trust any language that is championed by a corporation.  Some big traps are Microsoft's C#, Apple's swift ,Google's go, Oracle's Java.  Python is also a trap.  Certifications are a trap.</p>
<p>It is possible for you to learn the true foundations on your own, but you are never going figure it out on your own without studying books on language theory, Baukus-Naur notation, Turing machines, and related topics.   Once you understand this stuff, you should be able to convert between languages easily, and even write programs to do it automatically without too much effort.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>With C# I can develop software that comes as close as C++ but compiles in minutes while it took 30 minutes in C++.</p>
<p>I don't expect you to believe me but I did build number crunching software in C++ and C# where speed meant the difference over the competition. I only lost about 5% of the speed in C# over C++.</p>
<p>C# Has the perfect balance to create literally everything. Of course in the hands of a seasoned developer. (I started with C# and .NET 1.0) so I know my way around.</p>
<p>And I didn't start with J#, I started with Z80 assembler. That was my first contact with programming back in 1982. J# was the first time I got in contact on Java.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree with this 100% if it weren't for the hideous beast that C++ has become. I still think it's the best thing we have, though. I agree with your underlying premise here. It's like the difference between studying Knuth or Steele and going to flavor-of-the-week seminar. One is a solid foundation and the other is dressing up a pig for a whiz-bang kickstarter video</p></div>

What is not visible at the developers side is that developers gets replaced by newer ones fresh from school that were not yet spoiled with technology that is 1 year old. You have done so much effort to learn to code and then after your 5 minutes of fame (about 1 year) no one wants you anymore. </p>

<p>The article is correct about the Ukrainians. I know some of them. </p>
<p>Western Europeans are degrading in quality. The reason is the SCRUM, we feel unchallenged and our jobs are as exciting as the script kiddies jobs. Two years down the road and we have not done anything productive, just meetings, meetings, demos and more meetings. But I keep my knowledge sharp by doing projects at  home :-) Many already left for better places, I think by the end of the year the only people they will have left are N00Bs that just entered the programming field.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I saw this video a couple of years ago. Maybe it was just earlier this year, but that doesn't sound right to me... Either way, my opinion was the same then as it is now: People <strong><em>severely</em></strong> misunderstand what programming is.</p>
<p>Consider 0:38 - 0:44 when he says: &quot;As long as there are jobs, people will specialize. And there's no reason to think programming is any different&quot;</p>
<p>Now look at the four jobs he put up as examples</p>
<ul>
<li>A toolbox (carpentry? construction?)</li>
<li>A helicopter (pilot? army?)</li>
<li>A briefcase (accountant? sales?)</li>
<li>A pizza (food prep?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these job provides value to the economy IN ITS OWN RIGHT. A carpenter create tables and chairs. A construction worker creates houses. A pilot transports goods and people. An army officer protects people. An accountant tracks assets. A sales rep informs potential clients of the value of products they might not otherwise know exist, and generates revenue for their business. Food is literally what we need to survive.</p>
<p>Now consider the computer, IN ITS OWN RIGHT. Imagine a computer sitting in a void. What can this computer do for you? It can do your taxes, but that's really just automating an accountant's job. It can handle the autopilot on a plane, but that's really just automating a pilot's job. It can manage the timer on an oven, but that's really just automating the job of a food preparation specialist.</p>
<p>Computers are <strong><em>automation machines</em></strong>. They take any job that already exists, and they make it more efficient.</p>
<p>When you think of computers this way, computers make no sense without the context of some other job.</p>
<p>When we &quot;specialize in computers&quot;, we're effectively trying to automate jobs that we aren't doing. When developing EHR software, who do you trust to understand the medical profession better -- a doctor, or a college grad who spend his whole educational career looking at circuit boards and not humans?</p>
<p>This belief that &quot;programming should be left to the programmers&quot; means we're trusting people with NO experience in a job field to try and automate that field.</p>
<p>It's my believe that we should take the best and brightest of <strong><em>each</em></strong> field and let <strong><em>them</em></strong> do the programming. You want good EHR software? Find the best doctors and let them write it. You want good manufacturing robots? Find the best and brightest manufacturers and let them design them. You want good tax software? Find the best and brightest accountants and let them write it.</p>
<p>I think everyone should know how to code. Because computers aren't some stand-alone industry that offers value in its own right. They're automation machines that are invaluable to everyone but require context to be useful.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Quite an interesting discussion. I agree that programming is gaining momentum. However, some programming languages remain more popular than others. Salary can’t possibly be the only reason explaining why so many engineers choose a certain language as their favorite. We decided to explore the factors contributing to Python’s popularity.
