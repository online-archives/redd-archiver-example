    <div class="md"><p>Back in the very beginning of when I started to learn developing I worked for a guy for free. I had the knowledge so why not? I pretty soon discovered that by working for free this guy could ask me anything and I just did it. Things got out of hand because he found a bug in my code and demanded that I came right now and fix it. I told this guy f*ck yourself and I refused.</p>
<p>The interesting thing was that after a day or so asked me to fix it and he would pay for it. Because he was now forced to pay me for my time, he thought more about what he wanted me to do and he started to respect me. </p>
<p>Doing something for free oddly seems to make people believe that they can own you. </p>
<p>In the beginning I wanted to contribute to Open Source project, but very soon I discovered that any contribution would be a struggle to get my code get accepted. I am there to code and help not to debate endlessly. I already have these issues at my work every day. </p>
<p>So what I do is I use Open Source code, improve it and give the results as feed back to developers that wants it. If they want to implement it they can, but I am not going to do it. I am going to focus on my projects. I work at my time and pace, when I want.
