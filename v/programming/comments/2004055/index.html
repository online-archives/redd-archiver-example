    <div class="md"><p>Golang because it's my favorite general programming language. It's a bit tougher than Python and a bit easier than C, but in my opinion it's better than both. Python is almost too easy. It's great for prototyping, but it'll spoil you and it's hard to stay stable as you program gets bigger. Go is harder up front due to being a bit more rigid, but it doesn't get unwieldy like Python. I imagine most any programming language would work fine for a text based game, but if you're gonna have flashy features, some languages may work better than others.</p></div>

<p>I guess you've never heard of the company Splunk? Their application is written in a mix of C/C++ &amp; Python and they bring in nearly a billion dollhairs a year. Sure it's not <em>solely</em> Python, but a great deal revolves around it. It's web gui even uses CherryPy, IIRC. IMO, if any code gets unwieldy, then I question the programmer's practices.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal projects are a whole different beast than corporate funded projects. Large Python projects can be kept from getting too unwieldy, but the amount of effort and discipline required increases the larger the project gets. With proper funding and planning this can be done just fine, but if somebody starts out prototyping and experimenting, it's a significant long term risk factor, but only if the program is going to get big. I'm not saying that more statically structured programming languages can't also become unwieldy, but the scale at which and likelihood of it occurring is totally different than squishy soft dynamic languages.</p></div>

<p>Here's a pretty good collection about various languages and their pros and cons, as well as roguelikes  which implement them. I'd say to use a scripting language to do the language processing. Id use go for things like generating dungeons (my current project involves this, go is succinct and fast). </p>
<p>The above wiki, if you're not familiar, compiles a lot of ideas catalogued from the roguelike development community. I find it to be a great resource for brainstorming.</p></div>

Nowaday you can always find a game framework for your favorite language. So no language is a bad choice.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Javascript.</p>
<p>You can have it in a browser so nobody needs to download it, which is a frequently underrated quality, or use stuff like electron if you didn't want it in the broswer. Disclaimer: I've never used electron or anything like it.</p>
<p>Suddenly find the need for serverside stuff for multiplayer? node.js lets you use javascript there too. It's fairly easy to use websockets with this setup if you have the need for it.</p>
<p>There are libraries like threejs for 3D graphics if you don't want 2D. </p>
<p>There are physics libraries out there for it too if you wanted to get real dice rolling movements or other stuff. Many are half-baked ports from other language's physics libraries, but there is at least one that is specifically made for javascript.</p>
<p>javascript has everything you'll need for almost any system.</p>
<p>Another idea is to use things like Unity and it can be played even in the browser, but I personally don't like it's interface and it's slow to load.</p></div>
