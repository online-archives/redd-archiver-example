    <div class="md"><p>I'm self-taught and now self-employed. I'm honestly not sure what advice I should give, since my own process was ludicrously hare-brained. An exercise in doing everything wrong. I floundered through a bunch of C tutorials for a few months, and the energy I wasted spinning my wheels and beating my head against compiler errors could've covered so much more ground if only I'd had a mentor to clear up the fundamental misunderstandings I'd had.</p>
<p>Like, to begin with, I didn't really understand what a compiler is, versus an IDE. I thought I needed the latter, whereas it's really just something to make using the compiler easier. I didn't understand that the idea of a &quot;language&quot; is really fairly abstract, whereas a compiler is the realization of what a language is specified to be. I didn't know about the shell, I wasn't on *nix, and suffered less for not knowing about these things, as for not knowing that these were important things to know about.</p>
<p>I didn't know what I didn't know, in other words.</p>
<p>So, #1 is to seek guidance from a human being, and not some bugshit tutorial website.</p>
<h1>2 is my own subjective preference: On Lisp by Paul Graham. That's what made everything click, and turned my view of programming from a vocational skill for pajeets, to something almost transcendent. Wizard magic. An infinite frontier littered with the cast-off monoliths of people smarter than me. Common Lisp isn't typically an OSDev lang, but the point of the book is to teach you how to think about programming in terms of language construction rather than the bare mechanics of a particular language, like how to subclass <code>Loo</code> to have a 'poo' method.</h1>
<h1>3: If you're not already, become conversant with mathematics, and in particular learn linear algebra now rather than down the line when you find that not being able to understand math is a serious roadblock.</h1></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent reply.  Ludicrous is good since I like to stay there.   I prefer the terminal with what I already have done.   I will take this advice to heart.  Never tried Lisp, but I will.  Thanks.   If I could upvote you twice, I would.</p></div>

Since I am mechanically oriented, I started programming arduinos for use in projects, and 3D modeling in OpenSCAD to at least get my mind &quot;thinking&quot; in programming mode. I hope this helps, and I'm following this thread hoping it will also set me in the right direction.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Start by learning c. The language has stood the test of time and will be a great place to start since almost everything is built on c. By the time you are proficient, you will have already learned many computer science concepts that will be extremely valuable to you. Don’t use IDE’s or other automation tools at first. Just use emacs/vim (if you don’t know either of those start learning. You can be functional with the programs in a couple hours if you put your head into it) Read comp sci forums, watch hacker videos, read books, documentation, and man pages. Comp sci is really about learning about how to operate complex abstraction systems, rather than actual coding. You can’t write a book if you can’t use a pencil, so when you run into something you don’t know how to do, find a tool to perform a task. </p>
<p>Remember that programming languages aren’t “magical portals into the computer” but programs built by other people to be used to create programs more efficiently. Avoid the urge to do everything yourself even though it’s tempting at first.</p>
<p>Don’t get caught up in political mumbo grumbo and use the tools that work best for what you want to do. The most difficult part is perserverence, but if you have discipline you can learn.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>To learn how to code go to the original documentation created by the company that is responsible for making the language. For example if one were to learn javascript. the most common language in the world with the most users and the most universality, one would go to mozilla.com. </p>
<p>I suggest web technology. Websites like chrome exist on all devices and platforms. A miniature version of chrome can run on cell phones, computers of all operating systems, online ect .'. webtech is universal and there is no need to invent a new operating system.

<p>You will need an IDE such as Atom.io. </p>
