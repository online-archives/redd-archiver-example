</p>
<p>Secondly, sounds like you want something you can add or upload content to, assign a tag (#keyword) and then search by key word or by category taxonomy.  That's a data dictionary, like what they use for intranets.</p>
<p>There are open source version of these which I would imagine will run off a disc:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don't think you understand how programming or the internet works. You would need much more than a new browser or search engine to make this work. Start learning to program in a real language (not JavaScript) and you will start understanding how making browsers is a pretty big undertaking. A simple text and image browser like the original Netscape browser would not be too difficult, but modern browsers are expected to handle much, much more than simple marked up text and static images. I wouldn't want to try pleasing people today with their high expectations.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>it is possible to both make a browser and a search engine. So TheKingAndLandR1 doesn't really know what he is talking about.</p>
<p>you wouldnt necessarily NEED more than a browser and search engine to achieve your goal, so I somewhat disagree with morbo. </p>
<p>The thing is, this is an incredibly huge undertaking. Making a browser can be done, but its a LOT of work. Something one guy buy himself doing in his own free time probably wont get done before he dies. You'd probably need a team of people.</p>
<p>Another problem is that without categories being self-registered into a universally accessible database (which is probably TheKing..'s suggestion) you will need to develop a system that crawls websites, and attempts to judge intent and category. This is not impossible, but it is even harder than building the browser from scratch (unless you are willing to take massive shortcuts which will destroy the quality of the results).</p>
<p>So the question is.. how much money would you throw at this? and how do you expect it to pay for itself if the extreme majority of people who are willing to spend money on these things don't care to leave Chrome?</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no SEO involved it is Adwords</p>
<p>This company offer you five search strings which they will put on first page of Google sponsored listings for initially 99 pounds/month and subsequent months at less, 25 I think. This apparently allows unlimited clickthroughs with no daily caps. They say that because they buy Adwords wholesale they can do this. </p>
<p>It occurred to me that if I chose some very general keywords it could drive a lot of traffic on keywords that would be too expensive for me to buy on Adwords. Or would this be a waste of time as the traffic would be so unfocussed that even large numbers of clicks would lead to minimum sales.</p></div>
