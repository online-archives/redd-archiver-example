    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we should rewrite the entire thing to Go. I mean Rust. I mean Nim. I mean Crystal. Wait, what's the flavor of the month again? There's nothing wrong with .NET. Isn't Reddit even written in Python, which is considerable slower than CLR? Either way, it doesn't matter. I also don't see how you can suggest Rails over any other alternative out there. This post reeks of trolling. The mere fact you think a project like this can't be anywhere close to complicated shows your post has to be taken with a grain of salt already.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I've seen sites written in plenty of languages that scale exceptionally well and sites written in plenty of languages that scale terribly. The platform doesn't matter nearly as much as how well the system is designed and implemented. Obviously some platforms make doing the right thing easier than others but at the end of the day, if you don't know what you're really doing then you're going to struggle to build a scalable system regardless of what stack you happen to be using.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>There's nothing wrong with ASP or C#. As a matter of fact I think both of those choices on a purely technical basis are superior to what reddit is running. The only problem I see in terms of scaling out is the data store which is MSSQL. However MSSQL can go a pretty long way before it needs to be replaced with some NoSQLy AP thing like Cassandra. </p>
<p>Why do you think Rails (ruby) will scale better than C#? CLR's concurrency/gc/jit/overall speed story is superior to ruby. If you want to use Rails you better be prepared to work around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Interpreter_Lock">GIL</a>. Unless you meant JRuby which implies the JVM and I really doubt that's what you meant.</p>
<p>Your statements about <a href="https://github.com/voat/voat/tree/master/Whoaverse/Whoaverse">voat's code</a> being not that complicated leads me to believe you've never written something like voat before and assume it's simple when it isn't. In my experience if code for a big project like voat looks simple it's because the creators have spent a lot of time and effort thinking about design and organization of the code base coupled with an understanding of the problem space. &quot;Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage -- to move in the opposite direction.&quot;</p></div>
