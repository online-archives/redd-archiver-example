<p>I retraced all of my upgrade steps, ensuring all of the configuration options were correct, all of the files were where they needed to be with all of the correct permissions. I checked my Java version, and yes it was the current version. Hold up. I'm running the latest version, but it's over 20 builds behind the recommended build of the JRE.</p>
<p>The Oracle Java website distributes one build per version rev. I did not realize that. My devs coded for a newer build, which is only available to download from Oracle's Support site. Surely a build number, not even a minor release number, wouldn't solve what is most likely a problem I caused during the upgrade.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know already. TLSv1.2 is bugged in early builds of the latest Java 8 JRE. After upgrading to build 32 as was recommended, the servers started talking to each other. SAME VERSION NUMBER, but a build released about a month after initial release fixed the bug.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I've been an admin with 10-12 versions. I had to do the 11 to 12 upgrade personally with one of the (two) systems I was working on that used Oracle DB. That wasn't particularly easy, because the upgrade utility failed out in the middle of it with little explanation of why. The DB seemed to be okay though. Everything started up just fine, and the data was there.</p>
<p>The only real problem I've had was when we setup Transparent Data Encryption in 12, just after the upgrade. For some unexplained and unknown reason, we couldn't use the same wallet for both server to server communication and for encrypting the data at rest. The only way I could make it work was to have two wallets with two different certificates, one for encrypting data in transit, and the other for encrypting the data at rest.</p></div>

<p>I'm a contractor (did 13 years at hospital). I'm primarily a developer but go roped in Oracle DBA (under a HEINOUS witch who later left in disgrace) the last 3 years of that.

    <div class="md"><p>Everything from Oracle sucks.  And all Java sucks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></a>.  Most Russian businesses switched from Oracle / SQL Server to PostgreSQL when they were hit by the sanctions, and it's quickly catching up with the most important features.  There are lots of <a href="https://pgxn.org">extensions</a>, and proprietary support if needed.  Given the cost of Oracle licenses, you can save money by hiring developers to write any features you're missing in PostgreSQL, for the benefit of all humankind!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a <a href="http://copyfree.org">copyfree</a> statically-typed programming language like <a href="https://nim-lang.org"><strong>Nim</strong></a>, <a href="https://dlang.org"><strong>D</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>, <s>Rust</s>, <s>Go</s>, etc. (Strikeouts are for languages from left-wing organizations / corporations that lobby for bigger government.)  Some aforementioned languages easily beat Java performance benchmarks, including for <a href="https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/">low-powered devices</a> and <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">Web scale APIs</a>.  Or use a scripting language like Ruby, Python, Tcl, etc - if you must.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't need a heavy Java IDE.  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download"><strong>VS Code</strong></a> is the most feature-rich editor for the languages mentioned above (ex <a href="https://areweideyet.com">Rust</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Editors">D</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki/Editor-Support">Nim</a>), and it has a pretty low learning curve.   Better still is learning vim or <a href="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/why-kakoune.html">kakoune</a>.</p>
