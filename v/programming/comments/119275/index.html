    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with number one. If you like programming and want to make a career out of it is probably the best reason to get into programming. If you want a solution for something there is little reason not to just use one of many currently existing solutions to whatever your problem is. Ultimately if you don't like it at least a bit and have a reason for learning it then you will quit. Having a problem to solve is piss poor motivation unless the problem is of critical importance. For the average person that is usually not going to be the case.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing to tie into #1 is: do you like fixing <em>things</em>?  If the answer is yes it's a lot easier to relate the same thought processes to coding.  Myself, I enjoy working on cars more than coding <strong>but</strong> software pays substantially better.  Once I realized the thought processes are similar it made coding much more palatable to me.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that if you are wanting to study programming, you really should have an interest in making a career out of it. At the same time though, it is much easier to get into programming if you have something in particular that you want to produce with your code. The money is not necessarily everything, and only trying to study on that premise may lead to a lot of frustration.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that having a problem to solve is poor motivation. I couldn't imagine learning to program without some sort of objective. I always absorb the most when I need to learn something into order to accomplish something else; not learning for the sake of learning. You should at least be applying what you're learning in some way.</p></div>

I think that the article is talking about someone who wants to learn programming just because they heard they could make a lot of money doing it as opposed to someone who is doing it to try to find a career path.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, it was/is knowing which and how many tools to try to incorporate into my learning. Should I just focus on JS? or should I be rendering all my web pages in reactJS components ? or should I really be learning backbone or angular? Should I switch all my work to coffeescript? should I already be using ES6 ? </p>
<p>Some days I see job postings for angular, sometimes people message me about reactjs jobs. Exposure to this sways my thoughts as well. I often think I should have just learnt angularJS by now, but then it seems almost old and less popular in the business world already.</p>
<p>Same goes for the side-projects I work on, it's hard to stick to one through to completion because I can't be sure when something is actually finished, and different projects seem more important on different days. </p>
<p>TLDR; The programming world is infinite. It seems like feeling lost and unready is a neutral state. </p></div>
