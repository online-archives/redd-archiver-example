<p>They all sound like money scams. The promise to get rich and successful while in reality you just become a code monkey. </p>
<p>Code monkeys becomes replaced by cheap Indian workers that gets a 2 month course to learn to code. </p>
<p>Edit: It is never my intention to become negative, but to shake the romantic dream that coding is for everyone. If you already give up because I wrote this post then it was not for you in the first place. For those that had the reflex: "*I am not going to give up because you said so*" are the ones that will succeed. Software automation is already replacing IT and developers jobs. </p>
<p>The only way to survive is to excel, and the only way to excel as a developer is when you don't follow the rules, you create them. You don't give in in quality, but you keep the quality or improve the quality by breaking every programming rule in the book.</p>
<p>e.g. Design patterns is like train wheels. You can't become a good developer if you keep your training wheels on. Keeping your training wheels on means that you became a code monkey and will be replaced easily.</p></div>
