    <div class="md"><p>In my honest opinion, I haven't really cared for any of them. In almost every case, I would rather use local offerings, simply because I do not always code when I can be online.</p>
<p>Depending on the device, it may or may not work with your browser well either (looking at you Surface RT).</p>
<p>I am interested in hearing others opinions on this subject, as I have been looking around for a good quality online IDE as well, if for nothing else just to use occasionally.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Also I don't want the choice of having to run the realtime static analysis (e.g. the warning/error squiggles) either on the server (therefore waiting 1sec for updates) or in Javascript in some clunky web browser. I think online IDEs might have a place integrated in to things like github, for quick edits etc, but Visual Studio stays on my SSD for now. :P</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I could give up Visual Studio, nothing compares IMO.</p>
<p>It looks like the online IDE's are mostly for web coding, although some also do some C++ and the like. Not sure how I like having my code stored on their servers, especially if it is not OSS. I think I will stick to github for online code management.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I could give you a thousand upvotes for that.  Nothing is free.  If the tool is free then <em>something</em> is being harvested and sold -- information about you, metrics about what or how you work, and certainly source code is not beyond consideration.</p>
<p>On another tangent, beyond a good search engine and discussion forum, I dislike <em>any</em> online dependency in my workflow.  I even dislike software downloads and installs from the Internet.  Yes, I'm a self-contradicting Linux and Android guy and can't imagine life now without such but I still don't like it.  There's something reassuring about knowing that you've got everything you need self-contained or in a box of discs to be able to pursue your coding without being dependent on a resource or tool that's so easy to lose access to.</p></div>

<p>'Tis pretty much why I have my own netflix, so to speak.  And my own music streaming service.</p>
<p>Just kidding, I'm talking that up.  I built myself a $2,000 10.7TB FreeNAS NAS.  I have a DNS jail, a wiki jail, automated media downloads, and Plex with PlexPass.  If I want to watch a show while I'm on my lunch break... I either stream from my NAS or I sync it before hand to my HTC One M8.  
</p>
<p>I think we have a lot in common on our beliefs of software and dependencies on &quot;the cloud&quot;.  I don't even use services like lastpass.  I made my own ghetto setup instead.  KeePass ad OwnCloud on my NAS.  That shiz syncs to my phone too.</p>
<p>I also stopped running linux on my desktop... but only because I do enjoy gaming.  I feel pretty insecure running windows though, because whether people admit it or not, I guarantee you're being spied on when you are using Windows to some degree.</p>
<p>OK I'll just be over here with my tinfoil hat.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Traditionally &quot;online&quot; simply meant &quot;on a computer&quot;; man pages are often called &quot;online documentation&quot; as opposed to &quot;offline documentation&quot; i.e. paper manuals. However since it's 2015, I will assume you mean on-the-internet.</p>
<p>I've always found the browser's key commands they get in the way of the key commands I like to use for editing and normal build processes. For instance, someone <a href="http://coolwanglu.github.io/vim.js/emterpreter/vim.html">made vim to run in a browser</a> but if I use F5 to run <code>:make</code> all of a sudden the page refreshes. If I use Ctrl-W to execute a window command, it closes the window.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Tried the free/starter package of Nitrous once to develop our own company website. If your team is already good at using version control, it don't really give you too many advantages. Except for the &quot;live/online&quot; mode (Google Docs style live collaboration). It's nice to have when we need 2-4 people to discuss a particular part of code and trying out ideas. The free package sometimes feel very slow when we open too many tabs but we don't see why we need to pay for just small advantage, sorry Nitrous :(( But I do recommend people to try it especially when the team and the project isn't too big.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried a few of them when I couldn't use the portable versions of my programs, such as when I was on a tablet (Surface RT, Moto Xoom). IMO They were just too slow for what I wanted.</p>
<p>But on the desktop, I can't NOT use a local program, it makes no sense unless you are doing something very specific.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the slow factor you were experiencing had more to do with the tablet. Front-end engineers use tools like jsFiddle and Plunker constantly, they are especially useful for demonstrating componentized code. Here's an <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/CommandLineDesign/1znaxv65/">example </a> of a currencyFormat tester I made to speed up the dev cycle with my Testing/PM team on a project. By sending them this link, they were able to get instant feedback about what the function did and then let me know what customizations they wanted. (For instance, they wanted percents to be preserved.)</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I know they were slow in the tablet, but they were also slow on my desktop. I don't consider the *fiddle sites to be online IDEs, they are more for testing scripts to me. </p>
<p>The online IDEs I was referring to are places like cloud9, Ideone, etc... where they try to give you that full IDE through a browser. This would be for languages such as C++.</p>
<p>I use the *fiddle sites a lot actually, and my professors always used them in classes. I think those are great, but they won't replace a local IDE for me.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried cloud IDE's like cloud9 and code anywhere and I didn't like them very much. They seemed useful initially but a few things range from mild annoyances to giant pains:
a) lack of complete control / root access to development environment. So installing packages is not always that easy
b) coding within browser slows you down and its clunky. I can't alt-tab easily (control tab is not that intuitive). 
c). the IDEs are never that advanced and you can't customize them much or install plugins like with atom or eclipse. </p>
<p>I much prefer hosting the dev environment remotely but using a local IDE like atom. </p>
<p>The cloud IDEs are pretty useful if you need to make a quick fix when on the go - from the iPad or even an iPhone 6. But thats an edge case.   </p></div>
