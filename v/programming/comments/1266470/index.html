    <div class="md"><p>In max/msp, I made a synthesizer.</p>
<p>It had a dual oscillator crossfading between the classic waves (tri, pulse, sine) that let you modulate the duty cycle, rate, and phase.  Those fed into another pair of equally configurable oscillators as FM.   Then I stacked two frequency shifters after that; each with their own envelopes, band merging, and dry/wet.  Then I added a configurable and eveloped biquad filter, made my own non-linear distortion, and topped it off with a classic soft distortion.       
</p>
<p>Still a great synthesizer, I just don't use max/msp hardly at all any more.  Music is fun.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in middle school and I used BASIC(?) to write simple applications on my graphing calculator to make math easier. I never understood why we needed to memorize some formula and then do 30 problems with it. Since the formulas are using using variables, I prompted for the values, printed out the steps with the real values and the eventual answer.</p>
<p>First math teacher I had that found out asked me not to share the code because if I could write it, then I understood the math. Another teacher later on said I was cheating and threatened to take my calculator away. I said it wasn't fair to do that because everyone had the same tools as I did and I shouldn't be punished for using them better than others.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was in 7th grade, the only thing I had was the QBASIC examples in 3-2-1 Contact--an old monthly magazine. I made a maze game using text to show the individual room layouts. I didn't understand error checking, so the friends of mine who played it were able to beat it by just hitting 2 on the number pad repeatedly.</p>
<p>When I was in college, I wrote a Minesweeper clone in JAVA. It was actually usable.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a program that would take the number of balls in a lottery draw and give you random numbers to use when you played. I never won anything. I made a second one that used the actual results from lotteries (i.e. populated the list with the numbers depending on how many times that numbered ball had been drawn in the past) to account for any non-random bias on the part of the ball (lol) but I still didn't win anything.</p></div>
