    <div class="md"><p>It's going to be stated in the contract. In the US the developer of code has an inherent copyright on that code. So companies will 'always' require you to waive this right. Some tend to get over zealous though and do things like claim ownership of <em>all</em> code you write while an employee for them. You could write some code while on a month long vacation in the Bahamas, and they could still claim ownership of it. Check with your company. If you think the software stands a very good chance of being able to be commercialized then check with a lawyer instead.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm going to avoid answering the question and instead recommend finding something to do to contribute instead of doing personal work on the company's time. If you don't have anything to work on, find some. In tech, there's always something to work on. If you've gone to literally every manager and HR person in your building and exhausted the options, fine, but I doubt that to be the case. This way you learn something, it reflects positively on you, and you're not crossing into any ethical gray area.</p></div>
