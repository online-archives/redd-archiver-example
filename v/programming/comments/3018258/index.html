<p>Anyway, it was a simple mistake. I provisioned this server as a backup/mirror. And while I was still waking up I tried to connect to &quot;it&quot; after updating my password late last night.</p>
<p>Panicked for a short time when my password wasn't working. Thinking I used a different password and was somehow forgetting. [Of course my Root password was immediately documented, but not helpful if my user account is inaccessible]</p>
<p>So I guess wrong enough times and my security locked me out. I will have to hop in through a 3rd system to get around my ban.</p>
<p>The reason? I was connecting to my old backup server and not the new one. Because I am a dummy addicted to caffeine.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>About once a year I'll change a password and enter it wrong with the same mistake twice.  So instead of Password1 I'll do Password2 or something, but the rhythm/pattern and keyboard keys feels right so I go with it.  I'm more likely to do it if I don't change passwords often.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My company rented one of those single man bucket lifts, the ones you can tow behind a truck with a ball hitch. Pretty pricey for what we were doing. My job was to go up ~ 25 feet in the air in high winds and change the heads out on light poles in a parking lot. Well I don't know if you know, but when you get up to those things they are a lot fucking bigger than they look. Especially when you are 25 feet in the air and the bucket sways every time you fart. </p>
<p>I get to the second to last head with the first ten or so being a success. There are two wires to hook up ,a hot and a neutral. Well my dumb ass is staring right at the wires and for God knows what reason I tied them together BACKWARDS. I have no idea how I did it. Never done it before, so I suppose I decided to try it while we were paying out the nose for the equipment. We turn the circuit on and BOOM, head blows up. $650 down the drain plus we had to bring the equipment out another day to fix one head. Felt about three inches tall.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>I'm no electrician but I wired up some apartments I built in an old factory. I ran a 40' 500mcm service to the third floor.</p>
<p>I think my douchebag tenants [I rented for parties and such while I was still finishing it, they had been on extension cords] swapped the wires. But it could have easily been my own mistake. So I basically turned it on with 220 going to their outlets. They told me their lights were flickering and burning out and one of their amplifiers fried. [Luckily that kid was a rich kid]</p>
<p>To this day I don't know if it was my mistake or if they were fucking with me. I mean I know they fucked with me all the time, but I don't know if that was one of those times. It would have taken a bit of courage on their part. I used sharpies and strings to separate the wires.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I think they were fucking with me is that they didn't seem mad about it.</p></div>

<p>Not until the second line manager asked if we got new laid did I think to blame anything other than the database changes.

    <div class="md"><p>You have to have vulnerabilities on your system to remotely exploit.  Then your machine has to be in a state to do it anyhow--the port is open and something is listening(in most cases).  Windows isn't trivial to exploit no matter what anyone says.  The same situation applies. </p>
<p>Now if you're the NSA and pay millions of dollars for unknown exploits then it's entirely different.  For us average schmucks a system basically has to be exposed and unpatched.

<p>However, if you have physical access to your linux box then just mount the volume, run mkpasswd  -m sha-512 -s &lt;&lt;&lt; passwordyouwant  put that in /etc/shadow, reboot and log in.  
</p>
<p>For windows, just mount the ntfs partion rw then run chntpw -u &lt;user&gt; SAM.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. But in my opinion, Microsoft has not only never taken security seriously, they have allowed NSA and others backdoors into their systems for over a decade. Backdoors are well known in some circles, and the tools themselves carry the keys to the kingdom. So when people like FBI contractors get them, they keep them. Eventually they get sold.</p>
<p>Pardon me, but nothing that is Closed Source is secure at all. It's only a matter of how difficult you want the lock to be to break for those &quot;insiders&quot; who have the keys. you say the NSA spent Millions, maybe that's true, but they did it to force companies like Apple and Microsoft to put intentional back doors into their products. Then the Letter Agencies get those tools, and then they &quot;lose&quot; them. [Due to a combination of incompetence and treachery, meaning they can have a contractor use the tool illegally and retain plausible deniability]</p>
<p>Such tools were used to monitor the State Department E-Mails for over 12 years.</p>
<p>After a decade of Bush and Clinton running things, not only did many of our weapons fall into the hands of our enemies, but access to our Corporate Backdoors as well.</p>
<p>Microsoft Security is a Joke that isn't funny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love linux but an argument can be made that it's worse.  Due to the source being open, those with the time and skill can more easily tract the vulnerabilities.  Remember all the patched released were vulnerabilities the entire time.  
</p>
<p>Many people think the thousand eyes on the code is a good thing and it is--if it's a thousand eyes. Usually it's just a couple and everyone relaxed because it's &quot;open source&quot;.  
</p>
<p>By the way, I edited my comment for an even easier way to reset your linux password.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I agree due to the open nature of it, there is that risk that people find exploits that aren't shared in a timely manner. I'm sure this exists. That problem is addressed very easily by never running bleeding edge distributions, installing only what you need so the attack vectors are minimized, and by compiling things yourself.</p>
<p>The exploits that we need to worry about when we are doing &quot;professional&quot; security for things that are mission critical or which host sensitive data of governmental or factional nature, we are more worried about commercial software backdoors than undisclosed, publicly available exploits.</p>
<p>Another benefit of Open-Source is that if you modify the code yourself in small ways, changing the order of functions or variable names then compiling OpenSSH yourself, all of those vectors disappear because OOB or memory exploits will no longer work the same way they do on other servers.</p>
<p>For absolute security, you get a 5-year old security oriented distribution, then you compile it yourself.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Hosting providers don't run firewalls by default. I know I know, crazy. IIRC Hillary's firewall was COTS home-office quality caca. And let's not pretend that the real attacks use staging grounds on more easily accessed systems who don't have whitelists on firewalls or use clunky bullshit corporate VPN layers to open. Smash and grab a corporate laptop, install your staging pad in some engineering or marketing server, whatever your laptop got you into, then work from the inside out. If I were you I would forgo trust in Cisco products from the last 15 years, for the exact same problems I described before. Sloppy, government mandated backdoors and a need to patch more frequently than ISP's and middle-path providers like to do.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>It's nowhere near that easy on my Linux desktop. I use LUKS disk encryption along with a strong password.

If I had to replace the hardware, it would be an inconvenience. But if all my documents, photos, personal information, etc fell into criminals' hands it could be a nightmare, e.g. identity theft.</p>
<p>It's more common lately for Linux distributions' installers to ask you if you want disk encryption set up.</p>
<p>That said, I do have dual-boot with Windows 10 installed. I don't boot it often, and only use it for video games that don't run on Linux. Like you described, its NTFS partition is vulnerable to being mounted because Microsoft doesn't let you encrypt your drive on the Home edition. I know that privacy is almost non-existent on Windows 10 so I don't keep personal information on it, never log into my email, or even use a credit card when I'm booted in Windows.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like when I had to log into our windows AWS instance and I was told that the password to the account needed to be changed, and it didn't matter what I changed it to, because it was the jenkin's build account. well the admin account also needed the password changed, I ended up changing that one as well thinking that was the account being referred to and lost the password since it was some random password generator i used in a terminal. Later my boss asked me if i changed the admin password, which is when I realized that wasn't the one I was suppose to change. We thought I was going to have to reinstall everything the next time someone needed it. Thankfully my boss figured out how to get back in somehow, but it made me sweat for a good while.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>The good news is that I was able to get back into my account even though I lost the password. That's also the bad news, so I can't trust its security anymore. Of course, unless it's an encrypted filesystem, password security is pretty ignorable since you can just remove the drive or boot into a flash drive/CD.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you were running in a virtual environment whose God was not the developer of the operating system or the master of the hardware, but the broker of your Software Environment.</p>
<p>Most people should accept this as a reasonable cost of doing business. I have chosen to focus on System Administration and Network Security which has been a difficult but rewarding road.</p>
<p>It is totally unfair and unreasonable to expect creators and content creators to also be in control of their digital domains. In this life, that challenge is in interfacing with some person or organization whom you trust to manage your affairs competently and with honor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My alcoholism is a symptom of my dissatisfaction with the world, my PTSD, and a general anger and depression.</p>
<p>I did the no-booze January, which I'm sure I wouldn't have done had I not gotten the DUI. However my wake up calls have been when I low speed low sided my bike in the twisties one time, [hit that sandy mash of gravel dust by the center wall of this 35mph canyon] and another when I dropped that same bike making a U-Turn across a mossy drain divet. I had really pulled back on drinking and driving, and that night on my bike I was legally over the limit but by no means was I drunk.</p>
<p>So in effect, I policed myself and became more conservative, not because of the law, but because of my own self control and sense of responsibility. I slowly over time moderated my own habits. </p>
<p>I never hit another car, never had a serious wreck, but who knows, maybe like a jerk posted above I was just a ticking time bomb. If not a DUI time bomb, I am full of rage and everyone keeps pushing me..</p>
<p>What has been a much bigger wake up call, though, is that since I have been stuck in this godawful state [of mind and of Nation] I <em>have</em> been drinking way too much. After the No-Booze January I looked in the mirror and saw a much younger man.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>After a few sleepless days &amp; nights of troubleshooting, sometimes I would step back, go home and just go to sleep.  I can't tell you how many times the solution appeared in my dreams, wake up, write it down, and go back to sleep.  Much of the time, the solution in my dreams would be the answer.  Amazing what can happen when you can think clearly, and not be distracted or side tracked by the things that go on in daily life.</p></div>
