<p>Silicon Valley programmers pressure friends to quit working at Uber - Business Insider </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'There are reports of more Uber employees sending out their rÃ©sumÃ©s, although an Uber representative says the company has &quot;not seen attrition rates above normal.&quot;' </p>
<p>'Still, here are a few public tweets of people pressuring Uber employees to quit:' </p>
<p>'After Fowler came forward, Uber launched an investigation, run by former US Attorney General Eric Holder, into its workplace. ', &quot;If you are a developer working at Uber these days, there's a good chance your friends are imploring you to quit the company â\x80\x94 publicly on Twitter, privately on Facebook, or whenever you talk to them.&quot; </p>
<p>'As Business Insider previously reported, programmers are routinely asked to do unethical and sometimes illegal things at all sorts of companies. ' </p>

<p>People in Silicon Valley can't stop talking about the &quot;toxic culture&quot; at Uber after a former engineer, Susan Fowler, published a blog post a couple of weeks ago saying that she was sexually harassed and that when she reported the situation, HR penalized her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of fucking course. As much as Uber sucks as a company, this reeks of white knight bullshit. So Uber was a-fucking ok before this harrasment complaint? Did no one remember how Uber was getting sued for mis-clasifying employees, or when they decided to doing data collection against users was just fine and dandy? Apparently, the employees found that Uber was just doing fine at that point in time .. fucking retards</p></div>
