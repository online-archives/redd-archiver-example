<p>I think that's rather encouraging. In what other line of work can you learn for a year and then start at an entry-level position that lets you work from home? Programming isn't a get rich quick thing, but with hard work and skill, it can get you places. That's opportunity.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>This is much better. Atwood concedes that a little bit of coding knowledge is important just as understanding basic plumbing issues are important.</p>
<p>However my opinion is that coding is just a tool like an arc welder, wood lathe, or propane torch. There is no point in teaching someone how to use them if they have no real interest in having a passion for using them. They should know they exist for a certain class of problem, but that's it. Then if they decide that they want to be able to build furniture then let them dive in.</p></div>

    <div class="md"><p>Stupid article. Even if you don't plan to get a programming job, it is still worth knowing some code. For example if you want to be automate some batch job or you need a quick n dirty custom program for whatever reason. Besides learning to code will actually improve your logical thinking skills. IOW there are plenty of reason to know how to code <em>besides</em> seeking a programming job. You don't need to go to any &quot;bootcamp&quot; either .. it is very possible to learn yourself</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn't say it's stupid. IMHO the important bit is that people need to become better problem solvers. This means understanding the problem and knowing which tool to use, but this also means that learning new tools effectively is just as important. Besides you know the saying, when all you know is how to hammer then everything is a nail.</p>
<p>Anyway, I kind of agree with the author, but I think they needed more stress on the understanding the problem part.</p>

<p>Because I see people entering things field that are not happy being a developer. But they are trapped there is no going back. Someone has to counter the &quot;hype&quot;. This &quot;hype&quot; is drawing the wrong kind of people into the developers world. People that should never been there in the first place. They will create bad code, upset all other developers and become depressed themselves.</p>

<p>But this is completely different! These are the type of people that does fit into becoming a developer. Natural curiosity.</p>
<p>Also good developers are not going to be turned away from my negative posting. Good developers will say &quot;Fuck you I will continue learning it no matter what you say.&quot; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides learning to code will actually improve your logical thinking skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have news for you, except for tiny programs, there is no logic in the developers world. If you rely on logic, your programs will suck, because all the libraries out there are full of design flaws, full of bugs, and designed by complete idiots. &quot;Creativity&quot; to bypass the flaws and create solid solutions is more important that logical thinking.</p></div>

<p>Despite advances in equal opportunity, if you’re an underrepresented minority, you’re going to have to be twice as good as everyone else. And that’s simply to demonstrate competence.</p>

<p>Lost a lot of credibility with that line. My experience with minority hires is exactly the opposite. They are hired without proper credentials to boost diversity numbers and can't be fired for any amount of incompetence. </p></div>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>While many coding bootcamps are legitimate and care for their pupils, <strong>an even greater number are run by modern snake-oil salespeople tapping into the average American’s desperation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have seen this in the photography too. SCAM artist trying to convince random people in the street that they can become models if they just pay them $600 for a photoshoot that they can use to go to a modeling bureau. The scam is that these girls pay big money for bad pictures and worse of all they would never have any chance in the modeling industry in the first place.</p>
<p>I see this SCAM now happening in the programming world. You will pay a lot of money to learn something that you will never be successful in. Programming is not for everyone. If it is not build into your very DNA, then you are going to hate being a developer. Being a programmer means 365/24/7 of none-stop learning. If you halt your learning skills for a few months then you become obsolete.</p>
<p>Right now when I am writing on voat I am also busy learning new coding skills. Becoming a coder means that you never will have a normal life.</p></div>

<p>That is a fantastic sentence.  Great point all around.  With the way people are if you teach them to plumb, you will quickly have people trying to cut the crust off their sammiches with a plunger.</p></div>
