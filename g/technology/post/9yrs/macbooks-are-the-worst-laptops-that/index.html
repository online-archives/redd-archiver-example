The macbooks don't have any USB-A ports. Seriously, how am I supposed to connect my mouse or phone to it. I don't even have any devices that use USB-C. Let's update the firmware on my router, oh I can't because it doesn't have ethernet port. Let's work on larger external monitor, shit I can't because it doesn't have HDMI or Display port. Let's watch a movie I have on DVD or Bluray, damn I can't because it has no optical drive. And fuck you and your dongles. If I pay 3000 euros for a laptop I expect to have all the ports. If I paid 250 euros than I can't complain but Apple is just taking a piss.

Now comes the worst part. Soldering RAM and SSD onto the motherboard is just criminal. You do realize that these things go bad and need to be replaced at some point or upgraded to larger capacities. Imagine that car mechanic says your brake pads are worn out. Now you need to buy a new car. You would most certainly lose your shit but then you expect others to gobble this up as the pinnacle of engineering.

    <div class="md">I work in IT, and my hatred for people who insist on using Macs in an otherwise Windows work environment runs deep.

It's always the worst of the speshul snowflakes who kick and cry and get their manager involved to put in the special "Mac request", just so they can load up a fucking Windows virtual machine anyway... And consistently, they're our most oblivious and high maintenance users as well.</div>

    <div class="md">That's the point though. Mac doesn't want you to play with their shit. Mac also expects you to pay to extend the functionality of your computer with dongles.

 Mac is intended for 2 kinds of people. 

People who are very rich. The kind of people who get someone to change a light bulb for them. The kind of people who go all in on the idea of planned obsolescence and don't care about buying a $90 hdmi adapter.

People who want to look cool while using whatever the mac version of photoshop is.

I'm not saying that these two types of necessarily lack computer skills, but they have other motivating factors for buying a laptop beyond hardware functionality.</div>

What idiots like the Op don't understand is that UX sells and has a price. Windows laptops are catching up, but guess what? They're few and far between, and the few that are getting near Mac hardware wise cost around as much as a Mac.</div>

    <div class="md">Hardware =/= performance parts. Track pads, build quality, industrial design. 

Windows laptops still don't have a match to the Apple trackpad. Close, but no cigar.  

Don't even get me started on the UX, they're still worlds apart. 

Yeah, if you're buying a laptop purely on spec performance, probably don't go Apple. If you actually care about how it is to use, Apple is a very heavy contender. FWIW, I don't use Apple products.</div>

    <div class="md">UX does not matter. The only reason why some developers use macs is because Apple has a closed ecosystem that requires it. All developers I have met use Linux or Windows. In the company I worked for there was one iMac that was rarely used for the very reason I explained. Windows laptops are always more cost effective than Macs, everybody knows this. I just checked apple's website and compared one of their i7 macbooks to Asus ROG Strix G15 with same specs. The only difference is that Asus has more powerful GPU. And yet it costs £300 less.</div>

    <div class="md">UX matters insanely. No, devs who use macs don't use them "because they're locked into it". Unless you think developing things for non Apple systems is somehow closed in the apple ecosystem? Weird take but you do you. You make shit products bro.</div>

    <div class="md">Yawn. Another poor complaining that professional equipment costs too much. 

First, you don’t need all that trash on the side of your laptop. I have one usb-c that powers the macbook and runs the display. One cable. If that port dies, I have 3 more. 

Second, everything works without having to fuck with it. No drivers, no reboots, no bullshit. You plug things in and they work without any extra shit. 

Third, it’s a professional computer. It’s what pros in almost every creative industry use.  The reason is, there is one environment and the number of things that could be different is small. Everyone has the same hardware and everyone’s software environment is the same. 

Last, it’s the fastest thing you can buy. Apple has been sucking ass with intel chips, but now that they make their own stuff, everyone else is playing catchup. 

You aren’t clever or original talking shit about computers you know nothing about, you’re just another outsider flinging shit from your hill of ignorance. Windows is garbage, Linux is for autists or poors, and Mac is for people that are paid to use their brain. Being mad about it won’t change that.</div>

Yeah you plug in the "wrong" dongle and the fucking thing dies. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252244260 You bring it to apple store and they tell you to go fuck yourself. https://www.reddit.com/r/macbook/comments/k359t1/new_macbook_air_m1_died_seems_bricked/

Yeah this is totally professional equipment for professional idiots like you. 

The ARM chip is faster in single-core tests only. In multi-core workloads the Ryzen still wins. https://www.laptopmedia.com/comparisons/preliminary-amd-ryzen-9-5900h-vs-apple-m1-the-m1-wins-in-single-core-by-11-but-the-ryzen-9-is-25-better-in-multi-core/

    <div class="md">One fucking rando doesn’t prove anything. Typical apple hater bullshit, find one comment by one random retard and base your whole argument on it. You complain that I’m incompetent, but you do the laziest research, which means you’re either incompetent or a moron or both, probably both. 

It takes a fucking idiot to spend MBP money and them plug it into an amazon special hub mixing and matching with Apple gear. Nothing like plugging a $2k laptop into a $30 hub so you could save a little money. Typical retard user that has nothing to do with Apple.</div>
