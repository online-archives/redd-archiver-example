Anyways--If you hold down the control key whilst pressing the left/right arrow key, you'll move not by character, but by word. If you do it whilst pressing the up/down arrow key, you'll skip by paragraph. This makes it simple to get to the start or finish of words, as well as quickly get around to a different word or area. If you hold down shift whilst pressing ANY arrow key, your cursor will move and correspondingly select the text. If going up or down it will select from where your text cursor was, going through all the text to the new cursor position. Try it and see what I mean.

Both of these keys can be also held together to do both effects at once. And it doesn't just apply to the arrow keys either, Control + Backspace will delete by word, rather than simply deleting one character. Be careful with this combo though, but of course Control + Z is always your friend.

I spell out control entirely to make the language here as simple as possible, but it's usually abbreviated as either "CTRL" or "^". The latter character is usually in more advanced environments. I apologize, I don't intend to insult anyone's computing intelligence. I'm simply trying to be as basic as possible.

So to summarize everything:

* Control + ANY arrow key              = Move around by word/paragraph.
* Shift + ANY arrow key                   = Select as the text cursor moves.
* Control + Shift + ANY arrow key  = Combine the features of the above two commands.
* Control + Backspace                     = Delete by word, rather than the usual character.
* Control + Z                                   = Undo.</div>
