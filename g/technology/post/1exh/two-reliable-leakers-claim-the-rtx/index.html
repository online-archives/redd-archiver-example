      <div class="md">For those who don't follow hardware leaks, these are not random people on Twitter. Both of these guys are known for their accurate track records when it comes to Nvidia leaks. The other leaker who goes by the name Kopite agrees with these numbers. Kopite is the guy who leaked a year in advance the specs of the Nvidia GA100 GPU as well as 100% accurately leaking all of the Super line-up specs a month in advance. He was also the first person to report back in May that Nvidia Ampere would use a new type of PCB for the Founders Edition cards, as well as it potentially using a new power connector (this is now confirmed, these cards will use a new 12-pin power connector capable of providing up to 600W). Almost all Ampere leaks you read about in the news are sourced from that guy (hes not the actual leaker, apparently he has a source inside Nvidia or TSMC).

Based on this figure and the leaked 3090 / 3080 Ti benchmark from _rogame, the final performance numbers vs the 2080 Ti are likely going to be:

>*Titan v2 = 40-45% faster (speculation, based on 3080 Ti benchmark, only has slightly more cores over 3080 Ti / 3090)*

>*3080 Ti = 35-40% faster*

>*3080 = 20-25% faster*

>*3070 Ti = 5% faster (speculation)*

>*3070 = equal to a 2080 Ti (speculation)*

This would be rasterization performance. Nothing is known about the ray tracing performance, at least nothing that can be substantiated with evidence (one guy claims 4x better RT performance, but there's no way to confirm the validity of this claim).

The top card has 24GB memory (GDDR6 @ 18Gbps), the 3080 Ti has 12GB, and the 3080 has 10GB. The leaker mentions that this can be changed at the last minute by Nvidia, but it's unlikely.

There's still a lot of confusion regarding the RTX 3090 and whether or not it actually exists. Nobody knows if it's meant to be the new Titan or a 3080 Ti equivalent. There was a leak of an ASUS 3080 Ti design so it's possible Nvidia may ditch the Titan brand in favor of the 3090, but this is not confirmed. Some claim Nvidia is worried about AMD's Big Navi performance, so they're ditching the Titan brand temporarily just in case the AMD card beats the top Nvidia card (they don't want to ruin the Titan brand image by having it lose to AMD). It's also possible that Nvidia is going to hold back the 3080 Ti and wait for AMD's Big Navi to see if they can get away with launching the 3080 as the top card (there would be a Titan equivalent card as well, but it's technically speaking not a consumer card due to the high price).</div>

    <div class="md">"Some claim Nvidia is worried about AMD's Big Navi performance" - Is there any evidence of this?

I originally had in mind to target the mid-range again, expecting this to be where Big Navi is competitive, but if there's evidence of the above I'd be interested.

My guesses would be they really aren't worried and will continue to rinse consumer wallets for the top-range cards.</div>

    <div class="md">The RTX 3080 is using the GA102 die, which is normally only used for the top-end Titan and xx80 Ti variants. The last time they used the top die for an 80 card was the GTX 780. They only do this when they are legitimately worried about the competition because the top die is much more expensive for Nvidia so they want to avoid having to use it for lower-tier cards. These new Nvidia cards are also using Samsung 8nm (10nm+++) instead of TSMC 7nm which is what AMD is going to use. This puts AMD at a significant node advantage, which means Nvidia has to push their cards much harder in order to stay ahead (hence the incredibly high power consumption). This also explains why the new coolers are so huge.</div>
