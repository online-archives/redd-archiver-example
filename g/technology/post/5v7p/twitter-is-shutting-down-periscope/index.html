      <div class="md">More than five years after being acquired by Twitter before it officially launched, Periscope is shutting down.

"We have made the difficult decision to discontinue Periscope as a separate mobile app by March 2021," the video live-streaming app announced in a blog post on Tuesday.

"The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while," it added. "Over the past couple of years, we've seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time."

Most of the app's live streaming capabilities have been added to Twitter as features, and streams that were shared on Twitter will continue to be available for replay. Users can also download an archive of their data and content before Periscope goes off the app store next March. </div>
