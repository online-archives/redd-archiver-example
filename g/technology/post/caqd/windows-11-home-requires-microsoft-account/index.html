      <div class="md">I knew this was coming ever since I noticed some new Windows 10 devices forcing people to create MS account during setup. This was back in 2019 intermittent and would only happen if the device had live internet connection. When you switched off the device and unplugged the ethernet cable or move out of the wifi range the installer would suddenly change and then let you create a local account. At that moment I realized that Microsoft will force this on all users. It will be only a matter of time. The compulsive consumers on Level1techs forums were calling me conspiracy theorist and paranoid but I was right.

Here comes Windows 11 Home and MS account is mandatory to set it up. Mark my words, this will come to the professional version too. Eventually they will move the Active Directory tools to Azure and you will be forced to create MS account if you will want to manage domain accounts in your company. Just like Sharepoint and Office365 management portals are in their cloud today. Once everybody is signed in with online accounts in their computers it is not out of the question that they will start charging people monthly subscription because gotta keep maximising those profits.

The worst thing will be that most people will happily put up with this and cheer on as the corporation takes away all control from our equipment. Fucking bootlickers.</div>

    <div class="md">I wonder if there's a way to block auto-update at this point entirely to prevent it from installing anything, because this is going to be cancer, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on this. It will be ridiculous, I don't want to have to switch to Linux if I can help it with the compatibility issues especially with regards to my work but microsoft may leave us all with no choice if we have to connect to a Microsoft account of all things. Although then again, what's to stop us all from just making throwaway accounts to get around the problem? It seems pretty daft.</div>

    <div class="md">I believe the current EULA of Windows 10 says if you login to your computer with online account they have the right to go through your files on HDD. So it does not matter if the account you are using is real or with fake name because they will be able to view all your shit. Windows 11 EULA will be similar but worse I imagine.</div>

    <div class="md">Gaslighting. Over a jab at Windows. Microsoft Windows. Is this a special needs guild, or did I stumble on to Reddit? Here, Ill attempt to clear the air: Windows is a massive pile of unmitigated fuck. Those that take personal offense at other people thinking so, should have their shoelaces taken and their mittens sewn to their sweaters.

    <div class="md">I earnestly tried Linux mint one time, I'm going to have to study up on VirtualMachines now which is a pain depending on how intrusive the Windows 11 update is, I'll see how it goes but this is going to be a shitshow I think most people can already tell. I was playing Battlefield 1 and even in the chat they had started talking about it lol.

Thing that got to me as well is I tried getting Unity to run on Linux mint and it was such a frustrating pain in the arse, I need that for my work, not only was I having problems running my HDRP project, microsoft visual studio was borked too so now I have to research an alternative for linux just in case apofdpofkappfdapkpdoa. The only alternative if things get really bad for me is I'm going to have to import my entire project to Godot and I am NOT looking forward to that possibility, fucking microsoft trying to break shit.

I was planning on getting more storage space anyway but I suspect I'll have to account for the shit that a VM takes up just installing the pretend version of windows, what a gigantic pain in the arse, this is why I'm thinking of just doing a second mini-ITX linux build because then I can have one running windows and one running Linux without messing around with software constantly.</div>

    <div class="md">Vmware player is your friend on Windows. 

As for W11 remember that's its just an updated W10. Its not something completely different. Same base platform with some visual and workflow related enhancements. As long as your hardware is compatible the upgrade should be pretty seamless. Just wait a couple of weeks after they start distributing it before upgrading. Make sure you check for driver updates before doing so to assist in compatibility fixes. Same as you should do now</div>

    <div class="md">It won't come to pro versions anytime soon. They will cut their cash cow with business if they do that and they know it.
