I realise It's likely going to be extremely complicated but I'm still fascinating by it lol and I could see especially with being able to control motors and things like that how useful it could be. Say the world ended tomorrow, would any of us even know how to rebuild something like this and get our technology back? I wouldn't be surprised if most knowledgeable people would just get wiped out of existence and we'd be back in the stone age.</div>
