    <div class="md">Not just energy either. Ma Bell strangled the communications industry for decades, preventing new tech from breaching into mainstream. We should have had smart phones in the 1980s or the 90s at the latest. The idea of a futuristic Year 2000 was perfrctly achievable.</div>

    <div class="md">People never account for how corporatism, red tape, politics, and regulations can limit our ability to advance tech and build for the future. Capitalism was a good chance at that till those four factors started slowing it down somewhere in the 80s and to a crawl at about 05-08. I remember reading a study showing how our current tech level is about 60-100 years behind meaning to get where we are suppose to be now it would take about that long get there at current pace.</div>
