    <div class="md">That's such an insufferably normie interpretation of the current chip shortage, I have to wonder whether people even really want to buy televisions that much these days because as we know the PC market is going berserk call me ignorant because I'm not that knowledgeable on this but I wouldn't have thought the market share in televisions these days would even be all that significant, they even tend to act more as large scale monitors these days than traditional televisions and just have streaming services built in. Is it possible that it's more likely that chip manufacturers are having to divert manufacturing to cope with the ridiculous demand for PC components generally and that is having a knock on effect on the availability of televisions etc. as a result? I also think that there's more than likely some rather obnoxious profiteering going on with retailers taking advantage of the fact that people are desperate for an entertainment medium so they'll pay any price rather than wait out the cheeky fucks so they lose money for being greedy.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s not a Normie interpretation at all but a fact. TVs, computers, even cars. Ford is at a point that they cannot even deliver trucks to dealers for sale because they cannot complete assembly on many models because they cannot source the chips and boards needed.  It’s getting bad and not likely to end or improve anytime soon.  Dealers are even selling more and more used cars now as a result.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, I just feel like the article is potentially underestimating the effect various factors like the lockdown has had on chip availability, back when it first happen the switch instantly went out of stock and the scalpers got to work on the prices with that. Then next hit was the graphics cards, it seems to me like that would then have a knock on effect with everything else as people moved to other indoor entertainment tech to get their fix. 

I wonder if this goes a bit deeper than it simply being a simple chip shortage because of course there's the cryptocurrency aspect of it as well where the miners would just grab every graphics card they could get their hands on on top of that driving people to other products they wouldn't have normally considered. Then of course after the dust has settled all the stores are out so they're having to restock again and it's taking a long time for them to get back up and of course a lot of resources. If you get me, we've had the lockdown, the cryptocurrency boom all at once and that seems to me to be something the article ignores because they're trying to cite things like China/US tensions.

It's also worth pointing out that a lot of our chip manufacturing all seems to come from the same place, which was an incredibly stupid idea so if a country decides to just arbitrarily shut down all borders citing covid that's going to fuck everything up too.</div>
