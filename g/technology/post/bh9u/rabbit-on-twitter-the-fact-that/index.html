    <div class="md">The government has access to every single device that we own that is connected to the internet. If they want to, they can watch you and I both through our cameras and even watch our screens live. Your gov is worse than mine in this regard. The gov having access to my vpn usage through legal process to Nord does not change a single thing to me. A hundred tech companies with an open access database on every single thing about my life is much worse. Just imagine how much some SJW faggot working compliance at Facebook knows about your personal life because they have unlimited access to everything you've ever done on your phone and computer.</div>

    <div class="md">The difference here is that my Ruqqus comments aren't illegal in the US, so it's definitely a different circumstance for you, where you can be charged for 90% of the shit people say on this site. I'm kind of surprised to see you lose your cool like this. It's not like you. And you've completely missed my point. The gov already has access to everything, and I don't have to worry because I'm not breaking laws. Private companies don't already have access to everything, unless we let them. Opsec for me is just identity protection from private companies. I don't have the time or energy to setup opsec to block the gov (no one I've ever met does) and I'm not a cybercriminal, so it's not my concern.

Also, in your case, a VPN makes perfect sense. As soon as joe-butthurt cop grabs your IP from a site and finds out it's a VPN, the case is closed. They can't charge you for saying mean (honest) things about trannies anymore. And MI6 doesn't give a fuck if you say unapproved things on the internet, so their ability to access you through your VPN won't hurt you. 

If you think I'm saying it's okay for the government to do the things they do, then you've completely misread my comments.</div>

    <div class="md">I've heard good things about Mullvad I think is what it's called?

My other go to, less good VPNs are Windscribe and ProtonVPN
ProtonVPN cause it's run by the guys who made ProtonMail so I trust em, sorta.
Windscribe cause it's cheap, but they are Canadian based so in terms of privacy, who knows.</div>
