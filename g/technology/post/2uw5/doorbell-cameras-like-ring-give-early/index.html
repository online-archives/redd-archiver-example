    <div class="md">Clearly police SWAT tactics need to change. 

Most of these camera's connect to the internet by wifi, though some are hard wired. So running a jammer that disrupts WIFI when approaching a house to serve a warrant should be used, this will give the police minutes before the cell phone receives the video of them knocking.

Secondly if they can get the warrant, it should include a block for 1 hour of signals to the phone by the specific ISP company to be initiated by the police when they call the ISP just as they're going to start their raid.</div>

Not at all, I'm saying if states do this, keep appealing until it hits federal court and watch the state drop charges to avoid having to admit to interfering with radio signals in federal court.

I'm 100% against interfering with radio signals using any means other than passive blocking like a faraday cage.</div>

    <div class="md">You act as if this will happen with just any random interaction. I'm talking about SWAT procedure here where they're serving an arrest warrant on a registered address of record. When SWAT's involved that's a high risk dangerous person and less likely to be some random dude that jumped bail. Most cops don't even give a shit about misdemeanor warrants. Nor is police going to waste resources arresting some dude who's got traffic tickets or whatever the misdeamor they might have with an arrest team. If a judge issues an arrest warrant he's deemed those actions justifiable. Thus using jammers to block the camera from able to transmit cops are stacking up on the door getting ready to breach.

    <div class="md">I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying.

Interfering with radio (including wifi) is a federal offense.  If police, swat, whatever, at the state level use that in stings, arrests, etc, then the defendants in those case need only appeal it up to federal court, and the states will be forced to admit to committing federal crimes to make the arrests.

I don't know where you got cop hatred by me saying using jammers will screw over their case.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm talking about policing changes, what do you think, these cops are just going to willy nilly start doing this, off-course this requires State level or Federal level changes. The fact you assume that they would is anti-cop sentiments.

The whole warrant issuing thing needs to change as-well. Misdemeanor warrants should basicly given towards bounty hunters. Most police departments have policing policies to not even bother with misdemeanors unless the person is involved in some sort of other policing issue that they can then take them on to resolve the current problem.

Whereas felony warrants such as attempted murders or theft over a certain limit, assaults and so forth should be done by SWAT teams. A judge should also be able to limit what would be allowed. No-knock raids should only be allowed for people who have attempted to kill or actually shot people. 

I don't think jamming a house, and bashing their door with a SWAT team for felony stealing above $1000 is warranted whatsoever. Most of such cases still get resolved with a cop or two just ringing a door bell.</div>
