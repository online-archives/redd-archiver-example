    <div class="md">Exactly. 

I actually like the LGBTQIA+ tag since it makes it easier for me to avoid all of those degenerate freaks. Huzzah for bringing back the era of segregation! I just wish that you could exclude entire categories so that I never have to see any of these "oppressed minorities" *ever* again. 

Another reason why I like these ultra-woke tags is that they're probably unintentionally backfiring on their intended purpose by making White people more aware of their own identity while also alienating normal people and further eroding their trust in our liberal-infested cultural institutions. 

If our leftist overlords were smart, they'd just continue to pursue the strategy that they were utilizing throughout the 1960s to early 2000s by encouraging White people to be colorblind individualists so that the left could continue to advance their anti-White agenda without White people really being aware of what was going on. Instead, they've transitioned to constantly forcing White people to be hyper-aware of their own Whiteness and aggressively demanding that they act like groveling ethnomasochistic cucks and "allies" towards groups of people who openly despise them.

Imagine being a dreaded straight White male Zoomer that's currently trying to forge a path for himself through life by working hard in school so that he can hopefully secure a good job in the future and provide for himself and his family, only to get constantly reminded of how much our institutional elites absolutely despise him while also seeing all of these freaks and weirdos given all sorts of preferential treatment. What a perfect system for churning out militant Alt-Righters that want to completely destroy this entire system.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not a zoomer, I was born in the 90's but you've referenced the exact system I've seen and I went from mildly left wing and a-political on social issues when I first started, as I went into my teens I became more and more Libertarian until now I'm just an outright Voluntaryist and would happily see the whole education system burn for what they've done to children because these companies are only implementing these policies as a direct result of university and school indoctrination creating a mob of deluded tantrum throwers who screech when they can't be racist towards white people and attack others for thinking differently. 

I can completely understand though in this situation why somebody would become a legitimate racist towards ethnic minorities, it's just not the correct conclusion and an incredibly uneducated peasant way of looking at things which is why I mock the nazi larpers for falling into the trap of leftists. The racial identity politics is exactly what the left wants, because it means they get their race war and can stay in power using ethnic voting blocs for years to come, how do I know this? I live in one of the most left wing areas of my country and I know exactly how the left gets their votes. I think even a lot of Trump supporters and general anti-woke types are in denial about these tactics and don't know how the game is played so they incorrectly point towards anything else. It will take 5 - 10 years, but I will be having a huge amount of fun fucking with all these people now I have taken appropriate steps to protect myself from the left's bullshit mob tactics and doxxing.

I'll write it again as a tldr, racial identitarians and nazi larpers are a bunch of stupid peasants who have fallen for the racial politics ploy by the left. They want you hating all ethnic minorities so they can scapegoat you as the evil 'alt-right' and 'white supremacists' and tell people to vote for them in order to get rid of you, what a convenient boogeyman they've created. Thankfully they're so small in number they're pretty meaningless even with the constant fear mongering in the media so people just laugh.</div>
