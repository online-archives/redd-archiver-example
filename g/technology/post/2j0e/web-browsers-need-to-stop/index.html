    <div class="md">Firefox, Iceweasal and derivatives like Waterfox and other "stripped-down" versions of _open source_ browsers are perfectly fine. However, web developers need to stop loading pages up with 13MB of javascript that is just a bunch of repo-bloat to make a button look 3D and stream your interactions to 9 encrypted AWS endpoints.


This may be unpopular, but HTML, light CSS, and maybe, MAYBE one or two javascript onclick events is all a web page needs---and was designed for. If you want to play VR Skyrim in a chat box on Facebook, maybe require a plug-in? Or at least make it dynamicly loaded and not default mining bitcoin on my iPhone 4 kthx. </div>

So they keep adding new features that some people use.

Yes, but the web isn't driven by a single business. There are standards bodies involved that can reject new changes as long as the small players (Safari and Mozilla) go along with the decision. Google could still implement those changes without consensus like Microsoft did long ago with IE, but eventually this behavior would catch up to Google like it did with MS.

The problem is that the standards bodies have become weak and toothless, and most of Mozilla's revenue comes from an agreement with Google, so they don't ever give any significant opposition to Google. It's really an antitrust issue at this point.</div>

    <div class="md">I was already having problems with browsers before, but knowing this makes it even worse.

I wish Firefox could go back to the old model on how they did things instead of trying to become a redundant browser that copies so much of Chrome's look and feel. Coupled with their abandonment of complete themes, dumbing down aspects of the UI, and focusing on things that don't matter like Pocket, it's that kind of stuff that drove me away from Firefox after I had used it for over ten years. I was just fed up with browsers trying to strip away features to copy Chrome or throwing in bells and whistles nobody asked for, like Brave and their gimmick of watching ads to get cryptocurrency. I just want a good browser that lets me customize my look, feel, and functionality. Seeing how things are now almost makes me long for the mid-2000s when Firefox was still hands-down the better option.</div>
