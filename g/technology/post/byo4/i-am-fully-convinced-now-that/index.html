Those of us experienced in the field of computing are wizards to the rest of the world. It kinda gives me a feeling of importance; that the rest of the world views computers as black boxes of magic. Then I remember that there are so many things about computers to me that might as well still be magic because I don't know enough yet. Even with the most experienced wizards, they too must sometimes work with other wizards with other specializations sometimes. Pretty cool and humbling if you ask me.

    <div class="md">The hardware side is even worse. It's a miracle that anything works, honestly.

In my life I have gone from knowing nothing about computers, to knowing a little, to understanding everything, to knowing nothing again. I imagine it's like that with any sufficiently deep domain of knowledge. Eventually you have to either specialize or accept that all your knowledge is somewhat shallow.</div>

    <div class="md">I understand just enough to know that it's voodoo bullshit. Everything looks like it's made from standardized components, but then there's small variances between the same "identical" component made by different manufacturers, components that don't meet stated specs, etc. And all the weird hacks to fix ghosts in the machine are nuts. It's apparently normal to just reroute your PCB design "until it works" if you run into EMF issues. I have immense respect for people who can put up with all that.</div>

    <div class="md">> reroute your PCB design "until it works" if you run into EMF issues.

Two different pairs of wires, running in parallel both make EM waves. You have to twist them at different rates to change the frequencies, or increase the distance between them, until they don't interfere. Same principles with board design.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh yeah I mean I understand why it happens, it's just that fixing it (from what I've read) can involve a few rounds of trial and error and a good "feel" for how the circuit will behave. In that way it's more of an art than software.</div>

    <div class="md">What blows my mind are people who don't even understand really basic shit like installing Windows 10 from scratch, I think it's the same kind of experience I had with maths. Too many people aren't taught at all about it so they get frightened away because of how alien it is to them but when you break it all down and just take some time to learn it, it all makes perfect sense.</div>

    <div class="md">Information Age technology is just harder to understand, imo. A computer can be programmed to do... literally anything. And there is no mechanical components involved. How did the first safety bicycle operate? You could observe the parts moving. The first aircraft mimicked a bird. With computerized systems everything is obscured. Nothing can really be understood by simply using the software. You have to consciously seek out external sources to understand it. I guess a good demonstration of this is shit like Instagram, you have teenage girls that use it their entire lives without understanding what resolution is, what the code that runs it looks like, or even where they are actually *getting* that information from. 

i think in some ways it's like what mechanics is to me, something completely inexplicable and intricate to the point of being alien

i'm a fuckin' wizard!</div>
