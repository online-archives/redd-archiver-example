It's seems some very smart people realized Google SE is a fake - the only time you get the great results you expect is when NO ADS appear along with the search results. Think about it, why would you consider clicking an ad if you have great search results?

Example: When you search and get ads, add reddit (I know, I know…) to the end of your search. Most of the times no ads will appear and the results will be much better.

It is all explained at the end of this highly entertaining (but too long to post in here) post https://write.as/dyq6yf91tvp3h880
