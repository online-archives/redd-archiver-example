I thought the jokes about Apple were overblown but I guess not

Funnily enough, earlier today I read some bloggers posts telling his followers that Macs are faster and better performing than Windows PCs priced the same, adamant that it was the case. & that they're ok for gaming because he plays Hearthstone..

> Update: I bought the base model M1 Macbook Air and LOVE it. It feels like I now own a $6,000 top of the line intel laptop for video editing even though mine is the lowest model with no fan and only 8GB of ram. 

> Games - It depends on the game. I play Hearthstone and it's 100% fine on my Mac.

> Speed - On paper the $2,000 PC will be much faster. In real life, the Mac will be quicker in most cases and day to day use because of the hardware/software integration.

> Mac vs Windows - I used to have a $2,500 gaming laptop, brand new, and it was slower and a huge pain in the ass compared to my friend's 5 year old Macbook Pro.I also used my girlfriend's 2 year old PC vs. my 2013 Macbook Air. The Mac was still better.

Not surprised Apple feel they can take the piss if their buyers are that delusional.</div>

    <div class="md">There isn't a way that pleases everybody. If Apple bundled in a charger eco extremists would scream that they are wasting material because everybody and their dog already have a drawer full of USB chargers. When they leave one out consumer protection groups object about it.

I don't see any issue in selling iPhones without a charger. If you don't have a charger and adding, I don't know, $50 to the price if an iPhone (that frequently exceeds a grand), would be too much for you, then I argue you can't afford it and should rethink the purchase.</div>

    <div class="md">A chargers not gonna cost $50, especially for Apple to produce.. It's like selling a TV without a power cable or something - you buy a phone then have to buy a charger separately? Crazy. I don't think they care about the environment or consumer protection groups and that either, they have their shit made via slave-like labour in China or whatever, have that auto-degradation and slowness built into updates to make people buy a new phone, it's just being greedy and taking advantage because people will pay it.</div>

    <div class="md">Apple products are not known for selling at manufacturing costs. iPhone 12 boasts wireless charging and $50 is on the lower end of the prices of those chargers with some of the more sophisticated ones going for well over a hundred dollars. Adding those chargers to the iPhones would make the iPhones more expensive for consumers who would over time start hoarding unused and unusable wireless iPhone chargers as they now do hoard USB chargers. The approach of the Brazilian regulator makes no sense.</div>

    <div class="md">I see your point, though I still think they should add a regular wired cable charger. Fining them is a bit extreme, not that it'll affect them, but it does point out the cheap/greedy nature of Apple.</div>

    <div class="md">I think they should bundle it with a 6 outlet surge protector with 2 12 volt USB power outlets.

Seriously though, Linux phones can't come quickly enough. If enough open source software developers banded together we could really hurt Apples bottom line and force companies to build phones people actually want. Phones with big batteries, m2 slots , reparable ect.</div>
