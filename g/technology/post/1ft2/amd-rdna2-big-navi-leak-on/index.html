Due to the epidemic situation, the engineers we got could not fly, so it was delayed, but the release time is still q4 unchanged
In addition, the release of ampere in September is confirmed

>It’s not rigorous enough, that is, the foundry did not get the designed PCB. There is a small factory in Markham headquarters that can do the verification board, but the large-scale mass production of jigs has not been settled because the engineers cannot come to China.
The sample card has been sent to Shanghai, after all, the driver still needs to be done

Looks like the drivers aren't even ready yet, nor is the final design finalized. That means any performance claims that were made by others are bogus. Nothing is known about the performance. He also confirmed Nvidia is launching Ampere in September (announcement in August) which suggests AMD will be late to the party. It looks like both Ryzen 4000 and RDNA2 cards will arrive late in 2020, though AMD did confirm earlier that PC users will get RDNA2 before the consoles are launched. </div>
