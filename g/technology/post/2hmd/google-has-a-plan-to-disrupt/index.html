    <div class="md">Which is a shame. I know the whole memery surrounding those types of classes. But in and of themselves there is nothing wrong with learning new perspectives that challenge your preconceived notions, even if you leave the class disagreeing. There is real value in learning how to think, critically analyze new or controversial ideas, and expand the way you think. Taking in new information about the world is a skill that needs to be honed, which includes taking in and processing ideas that some, most, or all would consider "wrong." 

Colleges are actually pretty good at that, more or less. You can argue that they treat these subjects too much like fact recitation than academic presentation, but that's only part of the problem. The real problem is that colleges also treated like job preparation factories; that they're currently pretty bad at. But there is no incentive to improve because everyone involved just pretends otherwise and the money keeps coming in. College administration, industry, K-12 educators, and parents all still pretend that college is the one-stop-shop for everything that you'll need for a successful life. We're just now starting to wake up to the idea that no, that isn't the case.

We need both. We need mind training and job training. Prices need to be brought back down to reality. Employers need to start investing in training their employees instead of pretending that general educations will do it for them. There are so many aspects that need to change, and I really hope the baby doesn't get thrown out with the bathwater.</div>

    <div class="md">I think this is a good idea. Universities in the states are messed up. There is an argument for a more rounded education, but when you have to take gender studies 101 and why white guys suck 203 they lose their value. I graduated a while back with two degrees that are only tangentially connected to what I actually do. I probably would be in a different profession if I could have just done a tech course and certified for doing computer stuff. I can code in 3 different languages, run a lamp stack, do front and back end web stuff, build computers and do a fair bit of linux admin, but I don't have a piece of paper that says I can so I get no love.</div>

Don't have the money? let the new Google loan shark app help you.

Seriously I wonder if they are also planning to "filter' people based on their ideology, as I don't think google would ever hire you themselves if you're not progressive.</div>
