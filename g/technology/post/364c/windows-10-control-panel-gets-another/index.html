    <div class="md">And it's clunky.  What would be like a 500x600 window to view, is now full screen. I get they're doing it for touch-based devices, but it's still awful for everyone else.  Especially if you're administrating these devices. I feel like in future updates that fully remove the control panel, someone is going to make (and prob sell) a program that functions the same thing, as correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like all the control panel really does is edit the registry.</div>

    <div class="md">I told my friend the exact same thing. Someone else can make a control panel. And, of course, you can always Run `appwiz.cpl`. I doubt it will go away even after the control panel does for enterprise compatibility.

Also, Is touch still a thing people want? I thought that retarded trend was over unless you were an artist or something, which can't be a huge userbase.</div>

    <div class="md">MS is making the Surface still, so I'd say so.  There also seems to still be a decent amount of laptop-tablets.  I've had a Surface and actually liked it, but I really didn't find many issues with using touch for normal windows UI.  Their touch prediction is actually pretty good imo.  I have a Razer laptop that has a touchscreen, and I'm actually surprised how much I use it for simple stuff (like closing out a msg box, or window) instead of using the trackpad.</div>

    <div class="md">Agreed. I run MX Linux on everything I own but my home and office workstations are Windows because our primary business application is Windows-only (and doesn't work properly in WINE) 

They do the same things on Windows Pro on a domain. You have some control, but they've locked alot of the ability to disable cloud features for all but enterprise versions, but there are still workarounds. The whole thing is a goddamned mess.</div>

    <div class="md">Win7 overall ran better, but Win2K had a better UI because it was simpler and more customizable.  Any toolbar could be added & removed from Windows Explorer, as well as adding/removing any icon from any toolbar.  Win7 you could already see the beginnings of M$'s UI-lockdown and bad UI design as Win7's Windows Explorer had toolbars that I never used but could never get rid of. They were always in the way to me.     

Also Win2k still retained the traditional, simple,  fly-out Start menu that opened up sub-levels just by mousing over the parent.  Just move the mouse and whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop and you're 4 levels deep in a few seconds.  Opened the wrong Folder my mistake?  Close it by simply moving the mouse back to the parent.  All of the programs could be seen at once.  In Win7 the quick flyout menu was replaced by the little All Programs list that required clicks  to open any program, you had to annoyingly scroll through and jumped around when you opened any folder.

One more thing:  Having to click "Switch User" to put Win7 to sleep when the screen is locked made no sense and was anything but obvious.  

Now none of these Win7 annoyances I listed were show-stoppers, but they did make me wonder who came up with these designs and why weren't they tossed out early in development for decreased UX?   Looking back it shows when UI design at MS (and other software companies) started to be controlled by so called artsy-fartsy UX "experts" instead of developers.</div>

    <div class="md">I feel like one more iteration from Win 7 with the legacy UI would have been the perfect OS.  Alas, as you say, they got caught up in the artsy-fartsy UX crap and more specifically stupidly believed they could adapt Windows for mobile devices and touch screens.  No...just no.</div>

    <div class="md">Windows 7 was well on the way to abandoning the Control Panel and associated administrative tools.

2000 is wild because they abandoned the 9x internet explorer integrations but hadn't yet begun the UX overhaul that led to Vista.

The tooling is all built with win32 forms or similar, navigatable with a keyboard, clearly legible with consistent look and feel, and fast.</div>

    <div class="md">IIRC Control Panel was still fully functioning in Win 7.  I really wish they would have split Win 7 and Win 8 and left Win 7 for enterprise/business use.  All they needed to do with Win 7 was add in a tabbed Windows Explorer and it would be the perfect OS.</div>
