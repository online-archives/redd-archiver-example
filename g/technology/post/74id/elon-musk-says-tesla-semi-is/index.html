Musk added that the company does expect to have sufficient cell volume to meet its needs once it goes into production on its 4680 battery pack, which is a new custom cell design it created with a so-called 'tables' design that allows for greater energy density and, therefore, range.</div>

I think I've had to use the backup charger once in my life, at a hotel and since the dryer wasn't working they let me plug it into that outlet (you can plug into a standard 120v outlet too, but the 240v outlet powering a dryer is faster).</div>
