    <div class="md">Regardless of what occurred here, it should be known that "net neutrality" is just another case of the left circumventing the meaning of the term. Ten years ago, "net neutrality" meant exactly what it sounded like. It referred to the internet not being controlled by government.

Today, we're supposed to refer to this as "anti-net neutrality". They know that "net neutrality" is a positive-sounding thing, and had to embrace the term to confuse less knowledgeable people to be zombies for their side.

They consistently pretend that being against government control of the internet makes you a corporatist for the broadband companies, while completely ignoring the idea that the so-called "net neutrality" they support is propped-up by other major corporations like Netflix and Google.

They consistently lie about the effects of not forcing government control over the internet, saying years ago that the FCC's lack of regulation was going to cause people's speeds to be throttled differently per site that was visited (due to pay for play). This never happened.

They know that when the government gets control, they will be able to continue regulation with much more ease. Giants like Netflix and Google know that they will have the government in their back pocket as a bargaining chip to not have to pay their bills, and gain a bigger profit. This is a case of authoritarianism hidden behind the veil of freedom. Fuck these people, and fuck what they call "net neutrality" these days.</div>

    <div class="md">ok... but without some kind of regulation IP's could effortlessly discriminate against broadband traffic. for example, if Comcast sees that you were on 

https://ruqqus.com/

they could throttle your internet connection. like, seriously, without this government regulation anything you construed as dystopian before would become 100x worse. the only thing stopping these companies from literally removing us from the public internet is net neutrality law. i agree that it concerns me when companies like Google support literally ANYTHING, as they obviously have a vested financial interest, but I believe as advocates of the first amendment, we probably have a personal one</div>

Okay, has this happened yet? Because I think customers would raise hell.

> anything you construed as dystopian before would become 100x worse

Like it was for the entirety of the consumer internet? Stop with the preventative regulations. It's not a good thing.

Uh, no they don't. They support what gets them money. They don't support the internet staying the way it has been.

The problem is, that's not how government works. It's not as if just "for now" they'll do this. Once the precedent is there, they will do it now, tomorrow, and no matter what changes. They will then expand upon their control (the government doesn't shrink). Now, once that occurs what do you do, get rid of the government? You can't. Companies, even as big and influential as they are, can always be taken down in some manner. 

That's why you shouldn't err on the side of government control.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean, antitrust laws are effective. Trust me, I understand the government thing. But corporations are inherently worse than governments because they will sacrifice all human niceties for profit. And they tend to control the government as well. They are not loyal to anyone except money. Look at all our “American” corporations and China.</div>

    <div class="md">Listen, typically, you can opt out of doing business with corporations. You may not opt-out of the government's control. If you believe that a company doesn't meet your standards to do business with, don't work for them, nor give them your income.

Also, the government is not some passive entity to be controlled, it's an active entity pursuing control by the interests that give them money. It doesn't inherently have to do that, so it shouldn't. The government is not loyal to anyone except power, and unlike a corporation, it is eternal until there is a literal revolution.</div>
