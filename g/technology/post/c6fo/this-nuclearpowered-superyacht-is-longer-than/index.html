what a joke. i resent everything about this concept.</div>

These are the kinds of elitist pricks who enjoy wafting in the smell of their own farts convinced of their own self-superiority.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh Bill Gates, that explains everything, wouldn't be surprised if there was another more sinister reason behind them spending so much on a giant luxury yacht involving jurisdictions since Epstein's island is no longer an option. Now normally I wouldn't put much stock in the bitching of a bitter ex-partner but if she is to be believed the reason I think this might be the case is apparently he did the billionaire playboy thing quite a bit and like others I agree this is probably going to be his latest plaything. No coincidence as well that he's buying up tons of farmland and suddenly decided to start this very self-sustaining yacht project.</div>
