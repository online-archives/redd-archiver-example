AGREE TO CONTINUE: FRAMEWORK LAPTOP
Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.

**To use the Framework Laptop, you *have* to agree to:**

Request for your language, region, and keyboard layout

**Windows 10 License Agreement**

**Sign in to a Microsoft account**
PIN

The following agreements are optional:

Connecting to Wi-Fi
Set up the fingerprint sensor

Privacy settings, including Find My Device, inking and typing, advertising ID, location, diagnostic data, and tailored experiences

Any laptop that mandatory ships with windows is ripping you off if you can’t get it without.  On top of all that, it’s a middling laptop with MBP prices. All these things combined mean it won’t last a year. 

There are plenty of windows laptops that will eat that one’s lunch on price at the same performance and if I’m paying a premium, I should get to choose if I have a $100-$200 dollar license attached.</div>

You can get it without any OS preinstalled just select the DIY version.

You cannot easily repair a MacBook, a lot of isn’t reparable **at all**, with the Framework laptop you pay a premium for repairability.

They will release more mainboards with different specs such as CPU (chances of getting an AMD rather than Intel) later down the line, all without the user needing to buy a new housing, just switch out the internals.</div>

    <div class="md">It is what it is. You’re paying for a laptop that only one company makes parts for and you’re dependent on them for all future support and upgrades. At least with Apple, if you have AppleCare, you can take it to any service center. What will you do if this company folds due to poor sales and you need to replace one of the components that only they sell?

You’re really just choosing a different walled garden and it’s a tiny one with little sunlight. Maybe it’s a good idea, but people have been trying to make modular laptops for years and they never get anywhere because you can always get the same specs for way cheaper and the market rewards cheap, not modular. MacBooks are hindered by their price and these laptops are more expensive than that.

Edit: they are also breaking it off in you with that licensing cost. It shouldn’t be more than $100 for Pro.</div>

So like with every other laptop?

Wait, you mean if I break my **Apple** MacBook, I can take it to any **Apple** store *only*? When you compare things you have to say how one is better than the other, not make claims how it isn't any different.

>What will you do if this company folds due to poor sales and you need to replace one of the components that only they sell?

Like what? Their schematics will be available to repair shops (meaning not shops with framework written on the outside) and these places will be able to order chips from suppliers.

I would gladly pay a premium if it meant I own the hardware and don't lease/ rent it from the manufacturer and if the rest of the parts are perfectly serviceable I can just upgrade the mainboard every 4 years to keep up.</div>

Yeah, and pretty much every one of them is cheaper. 

>Wait, you mean if I break my Apple MacBook, I can take it to any Apple store only? 

Hardly. There are tons of authorized repair shops that are cheaper than apple. 

> Their(sic) schematics will be available to repair shops (meaning not shops with framework written on the outside) and these places will be able to order chips from suppliers.

That’s the same for any device, only you paid way more to be in that same boat. 

>I would gladly pay a premium if it meant I own the hardware and don't lease/ rent it from the manufacturer and if the rest of the parts are perfectly serviceable I can just upgrade the mainboard every 4 years to keep up.

The jury is still out on that and will be until these part become obsolete. I don’t know where you get the notion that you don’t own other devices. Finally, one thing that sets apple apart is you can trade your devices in and they hold value. For less than an entry level laptop each year, I can have the newest MacBook with coverage. The cost of entry is the same for an equivalent business grade laptop with software.</div>

    <div class="md">>Yeah, and pretty much every one of them is cheaper.

But can any of them be repaired like framework? Are they modular? Can i plug in dongles that fit in flush with the housing for more features? The answer to all of these is no.

>Hardly. There are tons of authorized repair shops that are cheaper than apple.

Please inform yourself https://youtu.be/0rCUF-V1esM

>That’s the same for any device, only you paid way more to be in that same boat.

Again wrong. Schematics are notoriously hard to get a hold of and you have to work out many things for yourself as the manufacturer does not want you repairing it.

>I don’t know where you get the notion that you don’t own other devices.

Because breaking internals on any Apple product means you have to replace the entire part (if a **single** charging chip breaks they (Apple) replace the **entire motherboard**) at which point its not so insane to buya whole new one or the newer model instead.

>you can trade your devices in and they hold value

framework will have an official marketplace where you can do exactly that.</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t know why you’re trying so hard to convince me this is a good idea. I don’t dispute that. My point is that this has been tried several times before and they all failed for the same reason. A laptop isn’t a desktop. For the price point these devices are at, they are gonna get their teeth kicked in by the rest of the market. If the top end machine was $1200-1300 they might have a chance, but hardly anyone is going to spend more than a MBP for less than half the battery life and middling performance. 

That’s my point, it’s not that a modular laptop is a bad idea, it’s that these will fail for the same reason as all the other attempts. They are way, way too expensive for what you get. The final nail in their coffin will be that by the time these get any market penetration, everyone will be moving to Arm64, especially laptops. They are moving the wrong direction, way too late, for too high a price point. A niche market won’t keep this company going. 

Also, Louis Rossman is a huckster that wouldn’t agree to Apple’s repair shop terms so he makes videos talking shit about his failed repair shop and makes no mention of the dozens of other shops that have no problems getting Apple parts and are cheaper than Apple factory repair.</div>

That was a complete lie and I regret wasting time speaking to you. From the start you have made false claims and doubled down, despite being proven wrong multiple times, now you claim my source has a failed repair shop when he employs 10+ people and survived through the pandemic despite New York City trying to screw him over constantly.

>makes no mention of the dozens of other shops that have no problems getting Apple parts and are cheaper than Apple factory repair.

Again, a complete lie. Apple tells the manufacturers not to sell chips to anyone but them, I urge you to watch that video and inform yourself before spouting more bs.

If modular laptops were viable, we would have had them 20 years ago. Further, Apple doesn’t do component level repair at any shop including the factory shops so Rossman’s shop is one of the unauthorized shops that doesn’t tell you how many devices become unrepairable and leaves a customer in the lurch because Apple won’t touch it once it’s been “repaired”. 

I’ve done component level repair on TVs and sound equipment so I know what this business is about. Rossman peddles outrage videos on the thing he makes a living from. I wouldn’t take your apple junk to him if someone else paid. 

Final note, if his shop was so successful, why did he have to move out and find a cheaper place? He would have you believe it was the rent going up, but the truth is more likely that he’s getting outcompeted by authorized repair shops because everyone’s rent goes up over time. He isn’t special and no one is picking on him. He just blames his failure on apple and new york and not his own business decisions.</div>

Modular phones and other tech have been tried and failed because it’s niche, I’m aware of this but I have hope that it finally takes off.

I’ve yet to see anything which suggests his customers are unsatisfied.

You’re telling me that YOU have done component level repair, a guy who just made claims earlier that you need a Microsoft account to purchase a laptop despite being told numerous times that you don’t, the same guy who has been doubling down in every reply btw. 

> outcompeted by authorized repair shops

They only have access to screens and batteries, which is the same official parts repairs that Louis can perform. Except random people send him parts from factories and schematics because of his channel, non of which the smaller “authorised” or any repair shops for that matter have access to. 

Apple restricts their chip manufacturers from selling to anyone but them.</div>

Of course you haven’t. Why would he tell you something that contradicts his arguments about Apple. 

>They only have access to screens and batteries

And boards if they are an authorized shop. You don’t seem to know the difference between board level and component level repair. The important thing to know is that no factory repair shop for any brand does component level repair. The time it takes and the expertise required don’t add up when compared to replacing the board or device. The real truth about shops like Rossman’s is he pays his techs a fraction of what they are worth and can barely do repairs for less than the cost of replacement. His own videos complain about this. Apple doesn’t provide their own factory shops with components because the cost in time and labor is too high. They only provide boards to anyone, Rossman ain’t special. I don’t repair TVs anymore because the diagnostic fees were half the replacement cost. 

>Modular phones and other tech have been tried and failed because it’s niche, I’m aware of this but I have hope that it finally takes off.

Help me out here, what’s it called when you do the same thing over and over and expect different results? That’s what this modular laptop is. 

>Apple restricts their chip manufacturers from selling to anyone but them.

So does every other manufacturer with custom chips. This is in no way unique to Apple. Rossman is trying to make a business model work that died 20 years ago and blames everyone but himself. No one, and I mean no one does factory authorized component level repair on any device from any manufacturer.</div>
