    <div class="md">I agree with the sentiment for sure, but there's no way for anything else to have happened. People aren't smart. They don't want to understand. They want to not think. When computers first came out they were for the dorks, now what you would probably call an autist. They were for people who were cool with spending 12hrs straight trying to make a thing do what they wanted it to do. These weren't normies. Even into the 90s and early 2000s computers were really just glorified word processors or email machines. Sure there were gamers and some of us knew about usenet and BB systems and icq/irc but not many and most didn't care.

The iphone brought the internet to rich normies. Android brought it to the rest. But it's not the internet you get on a normal pc. It's the walled garden of the app world. This is what normies want though. This is what they deserve and this is why there will still be a very small group of people who run lineage on our phones or roll their own arch and teach themselves vim. I've met people who code for a living who know fuck all about how things actually work. They know a language and that's all they want to know the end. This shows that "being the computer guy" isn't about actually knowing how to use one. It's about having the desire to understand how all the parts interplay and then having the understanding and motivation make changes or just see what you can see. 

Yes walled gardens suck. Social media sucks. Normies suck. But they are only really there if you choose to live in their space. Don't be a normie. Be the guy who knows how to jump over the wall and sees the digital world for what it is. 99.9% of everyone else just doesn't understand enough to care / doesn't care enough to understand... so fuck 'em. Let them live blissfully in their cages.</div>

    <div class="md">Zoomer here, I read that it wasn't just the autists in the 60s which programmed/ had knowledge of computers [source](https://www.historyextra.com/period/20th-century/the-changing-role-of-women-in-british-computing/), also some redditor commented how his mother learnt bash for her desk job which is way more than the average person knows now.

As for your point about smartphones, I've owned both iOS and Android devices for a while and can confirm they are equally rubbish, iOS's walled garden drives me insane when you need a £100 yearly license to keep your own app installed so why would I bother to tinker and create my own app if it can't be held on my phone for longer than 7 days as it needs to be signed again, how the fuck will I show people my app without knowing in a week advance that it needs to be resigned? Thats £100 a YEAR for something I want to keep on my phone that won't generate any revenue, at least provide a convoluted way of bypassing this nonsense so that normies cannot accidentally install malware without cucking me. I want a cozy device not a portable Linux terminal, thats what laptops are for, Android has benefits but my PC has it all so I can live without having these nice features when I'm not at home.

Smartphones are a normie device and all the options are rubbish imo, at least with an iPhone I get an OLED screen, Dolby Audio and a working backup feature which Android STILL doesn't have! Oh well, at least when it comes to computers there are still good options and more coming.</div>

    <div class="md">I wholeheartedly agree with the authors concerns, I wrote a poem that kinda touches on the mentality we're stuck in, but it needs some work. 

Through malicious incompetence again and again we've been failed by the institutions designed to protect us. Yet the population continues shambling apathetically forward along this gently declining road. 

The road to pacification, institutionalization and finally; domestication. 

Fearing the shepards ire, oh how we've embraced detention in the hope of escaping the crook.

Patiently, willingly -even wantingly- we celebrate each wall as it's erected around us, the rolls of razor wire flowing, twisting, winding. 

Jagged, unceasing cursive penned mendaciously for our protection, but; the final flourish is left up to us.

The final decision, to seal our fates, left in our idle hands, guided by our poisoned minds. In a dictation, in a prison, choice; an illusion and freedom; a collusion.</div>

    <div class="md">True internet folk need to understand that ease of accessibility is a curse, not a blessing. The growth of the internet proved once again that gatekeeping has an important purpose, keeping out the masses. Other skilled professions have understood this for centuries. I'm bullish on things like +Urbit, Secure Scuttlebutt, Gemini and other less-than-friendly tech for this reason, we need an "inner domain" with an inaccessible technical barrier to block normies.</div>

Completely agree with everything you said and ironically I spout my hatred for the internet and technology on *Discord* every week like clockwork.

Urbit looks promising I've been aware of it for a while now, it provides a barrier to entry which blocks out the masses as you said, but in the end, someone will publish a guide on how to access this "new internet" which will open the floodgates to fools flying in and shitting up the place.

Gemini is brilliant because it was designed as a deterrent to big corps as their incentive to use it was culled by the inability to monetize anything, we need more technologies like this!</div>
