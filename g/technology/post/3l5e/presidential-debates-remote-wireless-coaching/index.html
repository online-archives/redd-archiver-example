This has happened before -- in [both debates](https://www.theregister.com/2004/10/12/bush_wireless_coaching/) between George W. Bush and John Kerry in 2004 -- and I think it will happen again this year, given Biden's manifest mental deficiencies. We can reasonably assume that Trump won't be using the tactic, which goes against the whole idea of a debate being a candid exchange that shows how the candidates think on their feet. If I were Trump's secret squirrel, I'd research [the technical side](cryptome.info/0001/bush-bulge/bush-bulge.htm) and deploy countermeasures.

Remote coaching is common, and in most cases quite legitimate. But not in this case. I strongly doubt that Biden's nerds will be stupid enough to fail to encrypt the material. I'd expect them to deploy both encryption and frequency hopping to a transmitter somewhere on Biden's body. This will be undetectable, given the ongoing miniaturization of electronic gear; even if detected, I doubt the media would even mention it. Thus the need for countermeasures.

I'd expect that Biden's system would be a two-hop arrangement: First hop to the receiver, second hop via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to an earpiece hidden in his ear canal. Encryption would make it extremely unlikely that Trump's side could hack in and deliver false instructions or a screeching tone. I think the way to go would be to simply jam the first hop.

My cursory research seems to indicate that Biden's coaches have a broad choice of relatively low frequencies. This would enable his coaches to be far away. But it would also enable Trump's people to be just as far away. If I were Trump's people, I'd deploy multiple jammers, and use them intermittently -- maybe 10 or 15-second lengths of silence when Biden was expecting help. This would make the countermeasures a lot harder to detect, and multiple redundancy would make it even harder to pinpoint where they're coming from.

Call it the 21st century version of the old Spy vs. Spy stuff from Mad magazine, way back.
