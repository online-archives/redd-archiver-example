    <div class="md">I think these technologies are the bedrock of "doing" instead of "thinking" about recent authoritarian trends. The sooner platforms exist that use this technology, the sooner we will be out of this storm. 

I'm really excited about starting to use it! Is it true that IPFS is mostly designed for static webpages? I found that kind of concerning because we all know the websites that really *need* to be decentralized are all dynamic (like social media)</div>

    <div class="md">I wish I knew enough to answer that question. I just learned about IPFS a few days ago lol. 

Just from what I've read, IPFS is way more ambitious than being a peer-to-peer discussion platform. IPFS is supposed to replace (or complement) HTTP. It's designed to be more efficient, since it distributes packets from countless different locations simultaneously. It's decentralized for the explicit purpose of contravening government control. IPFS from my shallow understanding is supposed to revolutionize the internet.</div>

    <div class="md">oh, dang.  They may not have recognized the words/concept.  Try using 'privacy' or BigTech in the title next time.  Good luck on your projects - hope they'll be something I can use soon. I have 2 PCs with Linux and a few browsers on them. I am no techie, but would be glad to volunteer to play around with your software or platforms and send a list and screenshots or even videos of any bugs.  I feel strongly that I need to be part of this change away from BigTech and BigBiz and if all I can do is tell you the things that seem off to me - before your official release- I'd love to be able to do that. I'm doing that now for a dev.</div>

    <div class="md">Clickbait BS about a half baked protocol. 

* Stable release: 3 months ago. Highly likely to include severe security vulnerabilities. A bit premature to say "Let's switch all our critical infrastructure over.

* Poisoned cache attacks work under the assumption of computing a hash collision, or updating a tree to cause a poison update. 

* Updating content requires propagation, which is slow.

* Dynamic content: WIP.

* Who handles data transfer if the page requires a back-end that isn't distributed? Right, you still rely on HTTP for that. 

1) What authority validates the hash table or settles DHT conflicts when CRDT fails? Or do you just lose access to sites?

Centralized networking is not obsolete. HTTPS is still safer, more stable, and in many cases faster. HTTP will not be obsolete for such a long time, it's likely to outlive us by several decades, at least. Unless the web's mainstream content changes to a media HTTP cannot handle. A virtual reality web. Hyper Reality Transfer Protocol... Possibly.</div>

    <div class="md">I think that right now IPFS has a very specific usage scenario. Mostly for shared databases or blogs for specific communities. 

But don't you see the potential of perpetuity with IPFS? Since websites are hosted among countless sources, it makes them way more resistant to data loss. That's something that I found really alluring, as someone who cares about history.</div>

    <div class="md">I did not say it was useless. I said it isn't a replacement for HTTP. Competition or associate, perhaps, but not a replacement. It's highly likely to become a commonly used protocol, or evolve into one. 

As far as immutable transfer of data, it seems great. 

As an accessible archive, it seems mostly great, but with the same issues of torrenting. If no one is interested in what you're interested in, you'd have to fall back to HTTP. 

As a twitter? Meh or Blegh.

Same for stock market data.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree and would like to ask that you post info on this subject if you see it.
I sometimes use Matrix, bbut dislike that the posts aren't like they are here on ruqqus or reddit or FB r other sites  Can decentralized handle posts. Matrix always feels like I am intruding on someone's conversation and the topic usually isn't one I am interested in.  If Matrix is how decentralized works, it seems too disorganized, too close to anarchy for me and thus a waste of time.  I have better things to do than sifting through info I don't want or need.  Matrix feels like a chat room and I like organized facts better.</div>
