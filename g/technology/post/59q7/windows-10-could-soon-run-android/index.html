    <div class="md">Microsoft should be in full panic mode right now. The M1 macs are making everything else obsolete almost at once. If this is all msft is doing, they are missing the mark. People aren't excited about the new macs because they run phone apps, people are excited because they are faster than any intel and they don't overheat anymore. The mb air is actually a reasonable computer to consider now where it was a strange oddity before.</div>

    <div class="md">Bro what in the sweet baby jesus's name are you talking about?  https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/cpu-apple_m1-1804  Microsoft aint worried about shit.  AMD and Intel squash the shit out of the M1 in the majority of benchmarks.  The M1 kinda fucks the hackintosh community bc the newer OS's are going to specifically look for the M1 and if it doesn't find it, you can't run that OS.  

Specs and performance wise though, that M1 is overhyped garbage.</div>

>Source: machine written website that scrapes raw stats instead of meaningful comparisons.

That website is complete horseshit. Compare the new macs to the 2020 10th gen intel macs for a meaningful comparison. The current desktop architectures are dead. Windows is already panic patching the new killer feature of big sur because they aren't stupid and see the writing on the wall.

Even if the performance was exactly the same and not better, the new chip still wins because you can leave the computer on for *DAYS*. No one is going to keep paying intel for their ignorant desktop chips that take over 200 watts to fully turbo. AMD barely beating intel won't be enough when the new AMD laptops are measured in hours and the new macs are measured in days.</div>

    <div class="md">Haha, people don't want "power" in all cases and you forgot the compatibility with the type of processor that Apple will use. Windows have (unfortunately, I use Arch btw) a nice days for a long time. Ho, I forgot, Apple is not really accessible to everyone and people don't care about Apple ecosystem or whatever. People just want a Windows PC like 25 years now and real developers go to Linux (I won't talk about designer or what, they followed Apple whatever it do).</div>

    <div class="md">All the replies in this thread are so blinded by apple hate that you don't even see what just happened. I can't wait to see the posts in a year or two from people defending AMD taking ten times the power and heat to barely keep up with whoever releases the first good desktop ARM64 chip, presuming windows 10 is ported to ARM64 and stays binary compatible.

Intel and AMD are dinosaurs on the way out and you can't hate apple enough to make that not so.</div>

    <div class="md">No no, I didn't tell AMD or Intel are the future, ARM is powerful and I know that, it's not the subject here. ARM is not open unlike AMD64 (thanks to RISC-V to work on that). Windows is really really anchored in companies and customers in general (play big games on ARM is not for today) so, I tell you yes, ARM is the future but not in the near future like you think.</div>
