    <div class="md">It does matter because something like 90GB is within a reasonable amount for just watching youtube over the course of a month depending on the quality of the videos you watch. That'd also be a reasonable amount if you've downloaded a couple of steam games. Windows update can also use a lot of bandwidth especially if you have delivery optimization enabled.</div>

    <div class="md">Nothing like steam, no YT account and they're just like 30 second videos off Ruqqus that I view so I assume they're not likely HD or adding up to much...surprised it's possible to use 90GB on that stuff though for someone who does...the internet has changed so much. 

Not sure, could be the Windows Update thing, I'll go look into how to disable that - or if it's possible in Windows 10. Thanks. I assume it might be slowing things down, though I assume it wouldn't be transferring 100s of GB of  data since my HDD isn't even that large.</div>
