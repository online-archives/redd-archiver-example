      <div class="md">If I were the CEO of Apple, I would create three obvious services to ensure leadership:

*  Apple Browser

*  Apple Search

*  Apple Email

Also reinstate the old slogan Think Different.

With these three services, Apple could become the undisputed leader world wide in a couple of years. In terms of marketing it's an obvious win win situation. Instead of spending money on ads, these three services would ensure 100% coverage for users needs, which will allow a lot of Windows users to switch for Apple products, thanks to massive Apple presence on internet. This is something obvious that anybody can understand in no time.

My point is that even if the Apple CEO is a piece of shit, he still must understand that it's the best move in terms of pure marketing. This is still not happening, even if a simple research can show that people are tired of Microsoft and Google duopoly on internet.

The only rational explanation for Apple inactivity on internet is that it is purely deliberate. Apple is obviously not pursuing the goal of market dominance. Their inactivity is highly likely dictated by the fact that all Big Tech corporations are in cahoots, therefore real competition doesn't exist. This is why Apple doesn't make the only rational move to beat the competition.</div>

    <div class="md">Apple is a HW company. They make HW. With some SW on top, both to make the HW work at all and to add value to it, but it's still HW first. What on Earth would a HW company do with a search engine or why would they start providing services to non-paying consumers (email)? It makes zero sense.</div>
