    <div class="md">Probably down to the recent things with the youngsters. Having watched some of it and skipped in areas because of its terrible Billy Elliott storyline I see less than my kids gymnastic class, but some people are calling it sexual. This leaves me to wondering as I gaze over the hall at the other parents who is a fucking perv who thinks its sexual like that film. Watching children dance and wiggle, thinking sexual thoughts about it, then blaming the company for your lewd sexual thoughts about the children you're watching leads them to complain on-line saying its sexual, literally outing themselves as pedo's. Kinda like how women said there were no strong women in movies yet most of my generation didn't even notice that Ellen Riply and Sarah Connor were female leads as we didn't care for gender, just a good film.</div>

    <div class="md">No, please read. I mean everyone who goes overboard with labelling it as giving them some sexual feeling as I stated in my first comment. If you think it is sexual, as I see quoted repeatedly on-line then that means that you had some sexual feeling while watching it. Its that simple or you wouldn't have said it. Its the same as people writing  "I don't care what other people think" as their FB status, it literally means the opposite or you wouldn't have bothered writing it for all to see. It doesn't have to 'work' as you put it or gain some kind of publicity to be correct.</div>

    <div class="md">'If you think it is sexual, as I see quoted repeatedly on-line then that means that you had some sexual feeling while watching it.'

There's the crux of your argument, and it's wrong... otherwise, if a teenager has to try to convince the mother that this magazine with a picture of a bikini-clad girl draped over a car is perfectly innocent and the mother *objects*, then you would have to assume that the mother is at least inclined toward lesbianism.

Rather silly.</div>

    <div class="md">Fair point, but I think the mother would be more inclined to think that the woman is a victim and needs to teach her son that women are not objects, at least this is the reason I saw in most cases but I think this is class and regional based. If I saw a male stripper stripping I wouldn't think it as directly just sexual more as entertainment/funny but if I go a strip club with some ladies I would definitely think that was sexual. I guess it depends heavily on gender and age, as an older guy who's seen the birth of the internet and computers they are so far below my age in that movie I just could not relate at all. If you're in your 20's then you will think differently as only a decade or a bit more you were one of them and still really only just starting to adult. Someone in their 50's would see it more as this new "empower women" shit than something for that QAnon prank that amazingly came to real life.</div>
