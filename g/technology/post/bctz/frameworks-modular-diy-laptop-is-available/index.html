People are excited that this type of laptop is making a comeback, look at HN.

>their definition of modular is having 4usbc ports that your have built in dongles for

If you checked you'd see they will have other parts available so you can choose which internals you want and the ability to keep the same housing but completely change CPU generation is possible, its much more than ordinary laptop.

>it's 2000usd for a 13.5inch laptop with an I 7 and 32gn of ram. It's really not all that.

Why do you keep bringing up the highest configuration, what point are you trying to make? They clearly state starting prices for the DIY edition as well which is $749.</div>

    <div class="md">I think it's a scam or just an outright lie.

The cheapest functional laptop you can get from them is for an estimated 881usd without tax and shipping. That will push it over a grand. That's an i5, 250gb hdd and 8gig ram. The stated 749 price doesn't have ram, wifi or internal storage. That's dodgy as fuck.

The customize it yourself line is bs. Multiple computer manufacturers allow you to do this or have different lines with different specs.

The only thing I'll give them is that they don't charge extra for not getting an os. If you want windows the base functional model is probably going to run you between 1150 and 1200 after tax and shipping.</div>

    <div class="md">Cool depends on what you want. There were a few other decent Linux box companies around before. System 76 really is the main one though. Dell has some good Linux machines also. I think purism is the only other major company doing Linux machines, but they have a very specific purpose. If you want windows. They're are a million.

They main thing with getting a Linux box is the drivers. The only Linux line on that whole site says they are working with someone. Id be pissed if I got that bad boy and some stupid component was a cheap ass Chinese what'sit that isn't supported. Which is exactly why I switched from Asus to 76.

I would just suggest wait a month until people start posting about Linux installs.</div>

    <div class="md">System76 are using Clevo laptops, what they are able to do with them it still really good but I'd prefer if they made everything themselves like Framework. After reading this blog entry called [What Real People Say about Their Computers](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/personal-computer-stories.html) I'm leaning towards purchasing a laptop housing where the internals can be upgraded, S76 with a Macbook quality milled metal frame is exactly what I'm looking for and Framework are the only ones closest to that and Dells under $1000 are made from crappy plastic.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah I do wish 76 did all their stuff in house. I also changed out pop but they are easy to upgrade and work on. I think my only real gripe is the fan is a little overactive and the mouse buttons are a little jainky. I dumped my espresso on my keyboard one day and I was really really happy the keyboard is separated from the innards. I was able to get a replacement in a week.

There's always been the 1000 dollar computer line. Under a grand meh over a grand OK over 2 grand Mac. Hehe. I usually expect to spend about 1500 on a laptop.

If you go with the framework I really hope you do an unboxing for us. Maybe I'm way off and it'll be cool as shit.</div>

Notice how the website isn't janky like other laptop manufacturers, that's why I have so much faith in them, other sites have terrible designs and it shows they aren't going to support your model a year later. A ton of people want Apple quality and marketing (I think the site quality falls under that) and this is the closest thing as of now.

Going back to your previous comment, the dongles do take up a lot of internal space, my main gripe is the battery size as 90W would be great but its locked to 55W because of the chassis size constraint. Maybe we will see an improvement with battery technology soon as EVs become mainstream 🤔</div>
