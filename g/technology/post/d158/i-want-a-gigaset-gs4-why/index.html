Why do people even still have shit like a Nexus, a Sony Xperia1, etc…?

Degoogle and sell recent, high quality, aesthetically pleasing phones. There is NO reason why the GS4 shouldn’t already be supported by Lineage or even /e/. It’s modern, it’s beautiful, and it doesn’t support 5G. Yet, instead, there’s only the GS290 from however many years ago.

This is the kind of shit that makes it pretty much impossible to completely DeGoogle no matter how much I want to. No, I am not going to walk around with a shitty phone from 2010 just because that is all anyone will turn into a privacy phone. Stop selling shitty, ugly, last gen hardware.

Stop trying to sell old, disgusting, dilapidated, thick bezeled, bullshit phones degoogled. In fact, stop acknowledging their unjustified continued existence at all. DeGoogle modern phones of the highest tiers. DeGoogle phones people actually want to carry.

Move into the future, stop trying to sell me technology past.</div>

    <div class="md">How long is a piece of rope? I can’t answer how long something like that would take. I can assure you that it’s not a service with a fast turn around. Also, development of a degoogled rom isn’t a single task to complete. You will want your modern phone to get security and feature updates as well. This is an arms race between the people hacking ROMs and the makers of the phones. To answer your last question, you shouldn’t ask for the phone back since development is a continual process and it can’t be done without the device. 

The takeaway from this is the devs who are degoogling phones need support. They have the skills and knowledge, but they can’t sell what they do so they don’t make any money. If you feel passionately about having modern phones that fit your ethos, then your place is to use your money to help the devs win their battles. I can say with a high degree of confidence that the people bankrolling the operations will get first dibs on anything created and will be taken care of by the devs, but this isn’t a service where you can drop a phone off and pick it up in a few days. You are asking people who do this for a hobby to reverse engineer something a team of professional engineers created.</div>
