VPNs don't work, even the paid ones. As best as I can tell Reddit either logs your cell phone's unique identifier (I forgot what this is called) or the app itself just gets all your info from your phone (other emails, log ins, etc).

I've used random throwaway emails, deleted the Reddit app, the redownloaded. All with VPN on. Sign up for a new account and within a few days...banned. I did the same with Tor and that account is still active but automatically shadowbanned, I think?

I know a new phone would work, but what about just a factory reset and a new Google account? This is a Samsung phone, by the way.

For what it's worth, same ole story. I got suspended from a subreddit for posting the same post too many times. (It's actually a key feature to the sub, you just can't post more than 4 consecutive days in a row). Used my alt to come back to the sub and bam...permanent site wide ban for ban evasion. For those who say you have to do something really bad to get perma banned from Reddit, I can assure you that's certainly not the case.</div>

    <div class="md">While nagree with the others here that you likely suck...

Here's some tech background: unless you're rooted, you can't prevent an app from collecting some very specific data about your device: device ID most notably. 

Additionally, when connecting over the network, it can track your MAC address. If you can't change that, you're done. Even with root that isn't easy to change.

Most importantly, who gives a fuck about reddit</div>
