    <div class="md">Your last point is interesting. You could likely ace your computer sciences classes and graduate, but then you are faced with a business running on some legacy system written in cobol or antique basic and said business won't offer anything to train you. The IT solutions for many big businesses are built on custom made legacy shit that isn't relevant in today's world, businesses should expect to need to train people for their specific infrastructure.</div>

Surely nothing bad will happen when all those old dudes who actually know how the ancient code works all die off.

    <div class="md">I worked at a place (big well known global brand) and all of our systems were locked in an AS400 environment where they had one old white dude programmer who knew how to code for the system. Dude was a "private consultant" but basically full time employee who billed big bucks by the hour. He was a train wreck as well, took a dozen smoke breaks an hour, came and went as he pleased, hung over looking every day. He even joked that he knew he could walk into the CEOs office and shit on his desk during a meeting and nothing would happen because he was like one of 3 people in the country still proficient in whatever language our systems were coded in. This wasn't long ago either, early 2000's.</div>
