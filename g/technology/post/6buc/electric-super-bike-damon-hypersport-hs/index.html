    <div class="md">I honestly can't wait for electric motorcycles to become more mainstream. A lot of purists like being annoying by swapping out their exhausts to make them even louder while also looking down on riders that use quick shifters, but that's honestly my two least favorite things about riding my motorcycles. With electric motorcycles, not only will you avoid giving everyone around you permanent hearing damage, but you'll also be able to focus much more on what's going on around you without having to constantly mess with a clutch and gear shifter.</div>

    <div class="md">Being heard is an important aspect of staying safe on the road, just like being seen. Mark my words, there will be more casualties and accidents among the riders of electric motorbikes compared to riders with loud exhausts. *Oh I didn't see you* will be joined by *oh I didn't hear you*. Meanwhile those of us who are serious about road safety will continue to ride bikes with loud pipes and lights on during the day.</div>

    <div class="md">I consider the current battery technology to be a dead-end for electric transportation due to its low energy storage density, slow charging times and chemical instability of the materials. Unless the  capacity is improved by orders of magnitude (think 10-100x) it will remain a dead end.

There are some use-cases where electric transportation and electric vehicles make sense but personal mobility isn't one of them. Industrial applications with low/fixed regular mileage (indoors, factory and warehouse equipment, mail trucks that do daily rounds of 20 km or less and the like.

What I like about gas is that you can refill a tank in under 5 minutes and keep going, its high energy storage density and the sound of a running engine. When electric technology matures enough to be at least competitive in usability I'm sure I'll switch to it but not earlier than that.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't know if/when that time will come. It would help if proponents of electric transportation were a little bit more realistic and engaged to work on other practical issues such as charging infrastructure. Any and all concerns about the capacity of distribution networks required for a wide-scale adoption of public charging infrastructure (think cities) are being completely brushed over and ignored by EV fans, mostly due to being ignorants about the laws of physics. I am not an expert but I have graduated from electrotechnical university so I know a bit more about the physics underneath than the average Tesla fanboy who dropped out of a leftist indoctrination camp in California.</div>

    <div class="md">Relying on the loud noise of your exhaust in order to stay safe is extremely stupid imo. They'll still swerve into you. It's much, much better to simply maintain safe distancing and speed around other cars at all times - which will work regardless if your motorcycle is loud or not.</div>

    <div class="md">There are millions of ways how a collision may occur. No measure will protect you in all of them, not even a loud exhaust. However, other things being equal, a loud exhaust will alert people around you about your presence compared to an electric silent bike and as such it will make you more safe on the road.

Don't consider cherry-picked cases that fit your narrative. Consider all cases that happen daily on roads.</div>

    <div class="md">I’m with you on the exhaust, no need to be like the guy bumping bass or other obnoxious people, but part of the appeal of motorcycles is they take skill to ride. Cars are already dead to me as any dipshit can buy a GT-R and the computers will fix all of his mistakes. If you want easy get a scooter, if you want respect then ride a bike without assists and shift it yourself.</div>

    <div class="md">To me it's mostly about the sheer performance and speed and the sense of exhilaration that comes with being completely exposed to the elements and other vehicles around you. And there's plenty of skill involved with riding motorcycles that doesn't involve shifting gears - e.g., body positioning, leaning through turns, and throttle control being the most obvious. And besides, both the industry and the market is clearly on my side on this one since almost all of the biggest manufacturers are moving towards quickshifters and automatics - e.g., the new Honda Rebel 1100 and Ducati Monster.</div>

Yeah, and its gay AF. Tesla already ruined what was left in the sport of drag racing, fuck that shit in bikes. People can get whatever they want, I still won’t respect them.</div>

To give city range for a supersport is retarded and makes no sense. 320 kms highway range is not bad, until you need to stop for 2-3 hours to recharge.</div>
