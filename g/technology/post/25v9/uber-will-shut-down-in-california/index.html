"We think the ruling was unfortunate. We respect, obviously, the law and the court and the judge," Khosrowshahi said. "If the court doesn’t reconsider, then in California, it’s hard to believe we’ll be able to switch our model to full-time employment quickly, so I think Uber will shut down for a while."</div>

    <div class="md">Decades ago, taxi companies lobbied for those protections (medallions and licensing) that necessarily limited competition in the taxi market. Previously, in the decade following the mass introduction and production of the car, there was no limit on taxi businesses, and anyone with a car could operate as a taxi, and anyone could start a taxi company.

Its good that Uber freed themselves from the taxicab monopoly by paying off those in charge - that's the only way they get to reclaim their rights and freedom. We get the benefits of their innovation and forward-thinking every time we take a nice, cheap, quick and convenient Uber rather than an expensive taxicab that has no incentive to treat the customer right.</div>

Your taxi is owned by taxicab company that lobbied for these rules. Businesses don't hate restrictive regulations if those rules monopolize their industry and put their competitors out of business.

>while Uber got to do literally whatever it wanted however it wanted, and the law enforcers profited by pay offs

Uber bought themselves out of freedom - there's nothing wrong with this.

>while the people suffered because as soon as the cabs folded the Uber rates went up and the money rather than staying locally went to silicon valley California.

That's not Uber's fault, that's the fault of the rules and regulations placed by city and state governments on taxis.
Consumers spend money on what they choose - and they clearly chose Uber over taxis. City and state governments deserve to lose money that could be spent locally because they were the ones that made their local economies noncompetitive. In this case, it's good that Silicon valley California gets this money and not the local economies.

For some reason, you absolutely despise Uber for competing in a market economy, and winning, rather than hating the local and state governmental regulations that made the taxicab businesses, among others, noncompetitive. It seems like you're more anti-Uber, anti-Silicon valley, and trying to find whatever excuse to 'punish' them.

You approve of Uber getting regulated, in the name of "fairness", but don't even want to consider the possibility of deregulating the entire industry, and allowing free market competition, which would not only restore fairness, but also benefit consumers in both the short and long terms.</div>

Are you offering them a better job? Uber offers the drivers an option, and offering people options is never taking advantage of them.

Stealing from people and calling it taxes is taking advantage. 

Obviously, they would only take the offer if there was nothing better, and your whiny ass isnt offering anything.</div>

    <div class="md">Uber TOOK their jobs most were taxi drivers and owners who were complying with medallion LAW therefore couldnt even COMPETE, and now look instead of the money staying local it goes to the COMMUNISTS in SILICON VALLEY, the communist MEDIA aided and abetted all this by not reporting how unfair it was and presenting Uber as the best thing since sliced bread.</div>

So what?  Those jobs should not have ever existed in the first place. 

And thats why taxis were so bad, and it was a shit model, protected by government. 

Medallion law needs to die

> presenting Uber as the best thing since sliced bread.

Its not uber in specific. The whole concept of their business model is under attack by commies.</div>
