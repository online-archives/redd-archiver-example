    <div class="md">It’s mainly the ecosystem that really sells their product. Most people I know that own Apple products love how everything is interconnected together. 

People who’re into that won’t be going out of their way to use Linux unless it has some sort of ecosystem to connect all their devices together sadly.</div>

    <div class="md">That's exactly onto the point. Locking us into their ecosystem is their marketing strategy. That's why Microsoft gave the upgrade to [Win10 for free](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/29/9066749/microsoft-windows-10-office-app-free-upgrade-model).

You can see it not only on operating systems, but on all Big Tech. Like Google. They provide Gmail, Google Drive, Google Calendar and all the rest. They want us relying to them. If we decide to unGoogle we lose not only the search engine but also the rest of the services. Marketing 101.</div>

    <div class="md">Depend on what they do Macs are not that much more expensive. Now with the M1 chip entry level Mac can handle a lot more than it used to. 

Love Macs and PCs my self. I like them for different reasons and gaming of course PC although I’m not much of a gamer. Video editing in Final Cut Pro my 2011 iMac still handles it just fine. Finally showing it’s age but when doing intensive stuff. I recently upgraded but still keeping my 2011 model around then house</div>

    <div class="md">> Now with the M1 chip entry level Mac can handle a lot more than it used to.

What do you mean by that? Unless I am missing something then at least initially M1 Macs will be limited in what they can do until software becomes available for ARM architecture. Apple will have pushed devs to provide it for apps in the AppStore but 3rd party apps (and I personally run a lot of them) will be slower to update.</div>

    <div class="md">They can run same apps as they ran on last years intel model.

 “With the introduction of Rosetta 2, M1 and macOS Big Sur seamlessly run apps that haven’t yet transitioned to Universal versions. So without updating you can keep working. Thanks to Metal and M1, some of the most graphically demanding apps perform better under Rosetta 2 than they did running natively on previous Mac systems with integrated graphics.”

Also this is just the entry level Macs. This year they expect them to announce their pro line which should be even better. 

This review compare the entry level of M1 MacBook to the current Intel version MacBook Pro and result are quite interesting

    <div class="md">They have to make a choice. People who are used to using windows just aren't used to it usually. There's one newest windows, one UI style to choose, one office suite, and one desktop environment. 

These things make people not used to making choices about their software. "What's the best Linux distro", " well, what do you do on your PC", "idk"

    <div class="md">Ubuntu had its time in the light but it's over now imo. There's more and more focus on gaming on Linux as an alternative to Windows and Ubuntu is simply too out of date to handle that. Sure you can add on PPAs to bring it more up to date but in my experience once you start adding PPAs Ubuntu starts to spiral. There are simply better and more up to date distros like Manjaro and PopOS which is going to be even more important with Linux Syscall User Dispatch debuting soon.</div>

    <div class="md">I've heard a lot about compatibility issues but I have installed Linux on three machines and I haven't faced any such problem.

I'm not saying you're wrong though. Maybe I was just lucky.

A good trick is to try your devices from the live-CD of the distro that you want to install and if they work on the live session, only then proceed with the installation. You should upgrade the system to the latest kernel in the live session too.</div>

    <div class="md">As @Staikon and @AwfulWaffle say, I don't even think that's the issue anymore.

I put Linux Mint on my HP Dragonfly laptop, and plugged in my thunderbolt dock. Both my external monitors, and my USB plugin devices all came right up with no problems. I can disconnect and reconnect without any issue too.

What keeps people away form Linux is just "fear of the unknown" and a completely lack of willingness to spend any time to learn about it. People would rather be complacent making sacrifices to Windows than learn a new groove.</div>

    <div class="md">I have machines running windows, because that platform currently has some software that I want to use.  My primary two are Quicken and HR Block tax software.  I pay MS for a license so, I can easily run those and similar apps that make my life easier.

I have linux on a desktop and use it regularly, but most laptops come with either a MS or an Apple license and it is just easier to use reliably like that.  When I want to run Linux on my laptop it is easy to spin up a VM and run what I want.  I also have ChomeOS and Android.  I don't have any Apple because I don't like the custom connectors and have no software that exclusively requires their platform.  But I also have no illusions that Apple stuff just works, and they make is pretty easy for their users to just get stuff done, in a mostly secure environment, and holds up in value with their regular and long term patching schedules.

The OS is but a tool to get something done.  Your personal calculation comes up one way.  Other people choose other options and having options is a good thing.</div>

    <div class="md">I disagree. The vast majority of people only use a web browser, a media player, a pdf reader, an image viewer and an office suite. All these come preinstalled on all major Linux distributions, so they won't have to install a thing.

Some other aspects of Linux are also very user-friendly: it gets no viruses, its much faster than Windows, its performance does not degrade over time or by installing apps like it does on Windows, and the ability to update every last piece of software on your machine with the press of a button.

The problem is that these people find Windows preinstalled on their machine and they don't know or care to see what Linux is and most of them don't even know how to burn an iso on a DVD, let alone install Linux.</div>

    <div class="md">Sounds like you're over estimating the stupidity of most people.   Seriously, people are dumb as bricks, Linux would send them into a tizzy.  It has been tried before, and it hasn't worked.   Either they are set in their ways and don't want to learn anything new, or don't know any better, or just dumb.   

I have used a lot of flavors of Linux and honestly, while good, they are no where near ready for the general idiocy most people would get into... and then have no where to turn too.  It is NOT ready for the general public.</div>

    <div class="md">Apple does have a lot of assholery especially with the recent design choices but the reason people choose Mac is for the os experience. Macs hardware are optimized for their software. For certain workflows such as video editing or front end web development Mac is simply unbeatable. For example, in web development I get all the advantages of a Linux terminal to install my libraries and configure my environment but I also have a full desktop experience in case I need to open up Photoshop and edit a logo or an image. Also the Mac trackpad helps to quickly switch between terminals in the case I don’t have access to multiple terminals. Can you do those things on a different OS? Sure but it’ll probably take you longer and time is money. Apples knows that their OS experience is so superior that people are willing to put with some minor experience flaws (such as dongles).</div>

I kept finding software that had disadvantages in the apple platform, mostly due to unsupported gpus, and finally made the switch to windows. There's one super niche Mac os piece of software not on PC, but the rest is way better.</div>

Not everyone needs custom hardware so kits would be fine, even assembled kits (so, sure, don't use mac or windows, but you don't have to build your own either). 

Sometimes giving people more choices confuses and paralyzes them and they will end up doing less of what you're aiming to persuade them to do so businesses know that and often try to only offer so many choices.</div>

    <div class="md">>  author talks about having a PC from 90s that he still uses

Not really, he built one PC in the 1990s and ever since has kept upgrading it to the point where the specs are entirely modern.

> I know of this old PC from 90s/2000s that makes a ton of noise, any idea what might be making it or what might be replaced or fixed on it?

It depends on the noise, but with that age it could either be from overheating after not being cleaned for awhile (and thermal paste drying up), a broken fan, or the hard drive is dying.</div>

    <div class="md">ok thx @wuzizname @specklemouse too, maybe in order it can be cleaned, fan replaced, thermal paste, and hard drive (if the noise doesnt change at each step).

I think it would be good to remind people that they can still run some parts of old desktops (I think there is a common view they need to be replaced, entirely, in like 4 years' time) - any tips on upgrading old desktops? Seems like there would be a market for that kind of thing but on the other hand maybe a lot more ppl use laptops and mobile today.</div>

I don't know how much you can use a desktop from the 90s for, mostly because a lot of gains for computers were made during that decade but upgrading traditional hard drives (moving parts) to solid state drives (no moving parts) and maxxing out the RAM are some good options.</div>

Nah, it depends on the hardware and what you plan to use it for

>Should older hardware be recycled as "e-waste" if it doesn't have collector value or just held on to as toys or backup if all other technology failed?

Older systems can make for amazing tinker toy machines, and a backup doesn't sound too bad at all... At this point a lot of enthusiast-tier hardware from up to the 2000s is having its value go up</div>
