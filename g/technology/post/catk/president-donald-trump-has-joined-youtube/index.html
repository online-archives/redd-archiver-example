    <div class="md">The problem with Trump is that he prioritizes catering to his fanbase over deflecting accusations. So the Left Wing media gets him going, they get the sound bites they want, then they claim everything is racist.

I lean to the Right. It's frustrating though. The Right is dominated by people who don't have the balls to speak up. Consequently, the loudest voices on the Right are those that aren't necessarily the best representatives. It's another perfect formula for false narratives. 

I should note, I lean to the Right so I am harder on the Right. The Left is full of people who hate this country and people who are easily distracted by false narratives. "Hey that's racist." "Oh, okay." "Hey that's a conspiracy theory." "If you say so." Fucking idiots.</div>

    <div class="md">Trump seems just fine. We needed someone with his rhetoric since the woke SJW crowd went so insane. He also inspired more people to speak up and brought in some new people to the right. We seem to be getting more and more voices as a result as well who are likely doing the same, but with different rhetoric from Trump's.

>I should note, I lean to the Right so I am harder on the Right.

I can relate. Its more vital that the right be moving in the right direction.</div>

As left-leaning person this statement is absolutely correct. Lots of people who claim themselves as left are absolute idiots who think what if they're anti-conservative it means what they're left (while in reality they're even more conservative and dogmatic than conservatives themselves and this is says something). Braindead romanticism and smelling own farts is so strong what these folks doesn't know read problems and think what destroying racism and any word with phobia creates a perfect world, while making a perfect fuel for conservatism and even fascism (I even predict what Alpha generation will be extremely conservative comparing with zoomers).</div>

    <div class="md">I actually started leaning Left when I moved closer to a city. I think having such a broad group of people I was hanging out with emphasized the "Live and let live" philosophy for me. Then after Trump won the election it seems like the "Live and let live" idea shifted over to the right. The Right tends to want to control things when it comes to something like abortion. The Left has become incredibly controlling now. It almost feels like a bitter step father or something.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly both sides wants to control, only using opposite problems and solutions. Left-wing morons uses right-wing fuck ups to provide what they're good guys and vice versa. Only on 90's and 2000's were soccer mums to control media and in 10's these people switched sides doing the same thing. 2016 election was a first major point to see how left became fucked up in their own delusions and 2020 made me just downright hate them for a lot of horrible things they did. And these moments made me more conservative and also I started to appreciate right-wing people (mostly libertarians and center-right kind of people, still despise conservatives, fascists and traditionalists). As left-wing person (Orwell kind of left) I'll say what left and right wing are horribly wrong about problems, cause a real ones are political polarization, corporate control of almost everything, complete bias in media and strong division between poor and rich people (plus shrinking of middle class for a bunch), monopolism, destruction of small business and horrible education not only in schools, but by parents themselves. Not racism, conservatism, SJW, social media, any word with -phobia, nationalism, right/left-wing people they're all consequences of what I said and this what need to be fixed.</div>

    <div class="md">Speaking of, what's the general consensus on Parler? I'm still suspicious about the events surrounding their restructuring. My understanding is they decided to host on Amazon's services, it was claimed that Parler was utilized in the staging of a so-called "coup", they go down and the information of everyone who used the site is conveniently leaked, a new CEO emerges, and now they're back like nothing ever happened.</div>

    <div class="md">Their own DNS servers? What about the registry they bought the domain from, which can also revoke the domain license? How about Google, which can blacklist them from almost the entire world population online? I hope they also have their own payment processors too. Hopefully ISP's like Verizon, Comcast, and AT&T also like Rumble. And maybe it would be a wise idea to form their own government to avoid speech regulations online, which are apparently imminent.</div>

but the situation is more dire than anyone suspects. i think if there's a single fight worth engaging in wholly it's preserving the first amendment. as soon as the supreme court grants an exception to hate speech the internet dies like nothing ever existed in the first place, it would be instantaneous, intelligence agencies in America already surveil almost everything, they probably have a couple files on me already and I'm still pretty young</div>

    <div class="md">True, protecting the 1st should be main priority, but making people like and want the 1st should be the 2nd priority.

It doesn't matter how long you go on protecting the 1st if the people themselves hate it more and more. Eventually they will become a majority and that's when the 1st amendment dies.

This is absolutely scary.</div>

We can walk and chew gum, and wanting to use stuff like Odysee is not "hiding behind" anything. Trying to make YouTube a bastion for freedom of speech is an effort not worth fighting in my opinion. As it is, not being decentralized is a huge flaw.</div>

I don't think it's about killer features; more so about critical mass. YouTube has millions and millions of viewers; if I'm a content creator I will upload to YouTube as I'm more likely to grow an audience. It's helpful to cross post to alternatives though.

You could have have an objectively better UI/UX than youtube and it's still DOA. At the end of the day, content is king.</div>

    <div class="md">I completely agree. The problem with any competitor is that the moment it arises it is plagued with Right-leaning talking points. I'm right-leaning myself but I want to see MMA and Pro Wrestling related top 10 videos, fail videos, funny pet and kid videos, that kind of thing.

I really don't need 500 explanations as to why "The Last of Us 2" is shit and how Biden is truly racist. I believe both of these things, but I already got the memo.</div>

    <div class="md">You are forgetting one thing...  WHY NOT BOTH?

Youtube doesn't even have a youtube only license.. It would have to pay more ad revenue to creators and it doesn't have competition for now.

Rumble has both types of license.

You can build your platform on BOTH... it's not an either-or choice.</div>

    <div class="md">I actually think Trump would be better for attacking online Corporatism. He's aware of the issues now, has been kicked off of almost every platform, and if he runs then they legally have to let him back on which they'll fight as much as they can. There is no way for them to look good shutting out a major president while he's trying to run for office, and people may also be more likely to use whatever new platform he's on in order to follow the election. Plus he'd be the best at tackling voter fraud during an election, especially with Covid over. Also, Desantis is a younger guy and the Dems made it so that he can probably run after 2024 and easily win, especially if he becomes Trump's VP. I'm just speaking idealistically of course, this could all go many different ways.</div>

The only way a decentralized platform even has a chance is

1.) A borderline retard can use it.

2.) It has really good marketing to make it seem cool and trendy.

3.) It has some big name apolitical people to help it avoid becoming another right-wing political echo chamber.</div>

good decentralized alternatives are already normie friendly (matrix and odysee for example)

biggest problem right here, if only we had someone like the ex-president to advertise the plataform
