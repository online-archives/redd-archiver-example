    <div class="md">What about TTPs that are not "activated" until months after compromise? Some of these ransomware attacks sit dormant in the systems, which includes the backups, for months. You can do everything right and still fail. There's literally no protection for a 0-Day attack until the attack becomes known and studied. You can run everything perfect in your organization and still fail because there's no accounting for new but unknown TTPs.

This includes restoring from backups going back months and you just continue to re-infect yourself until you can isolate the compromise and sanitize.</div>

    <div class="md">this is something that occurred to me. like, wtf is the point in paying a cyberansom? they still possess the source code, with almost certainty. they can fuck you over 50 hours from now, or 50 years from now

i think the solution to this is to not get hacked in the first place. i wonder how hackers reassure their victims that they will actually destroy the code... they need to make money somehow so they must have some method</div>

    <div class="md">LOL. Probably using the same vector that they got bit with the first time. Honestly, I see these ransomware groups as grey hat. They are just helping orgs get their shit together. Obviously, 80% didn't get their shit together the first time, so they haven't learned the Infosec lesson properly.</div>
