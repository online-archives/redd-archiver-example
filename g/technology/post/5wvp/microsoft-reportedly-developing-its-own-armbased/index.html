    <div class="md">With nvidia buying ARM, intel and AMD are on borrowed time. The real tide change for windows will be once games run natively on ARM. Office is the main reason people use windows, so that will obviously come with windows on ARM, but the real change will be with games.</div>

    <div class="md">"Arm doesn’t make the chips itself. It is the steward of the ARM processor architecture, and it creates designs other companies license and use in their own chips for just about everything electronic"

So really the question is if nvidia would cut its on throat by choking off the licensing to others and a battle with apple and Microsoft, as well as Intel and AMD would be devastating to Nvidia.

And its also not like this type of CPU design isn't known. Amd and Intel could make their own variations and even enhance the design further as apple has. It makes for interesting times and ultimately we win</div>

    <div class="md">I think intel is the true dinosaur. AMD may try to make a desktop ARM chip, I just don't think they will be a leader. Plus AMD paying nvidia for the rights to ARM just makes it hard to see how AMD will compete.</div>

    <div class="md">Same here. The only mac I've ever owned is a 2012 mini I bought as a build system for iOS off if eBay for $200. I hate Apple and their philosophy and their ecosystem control, yet I find myself wishing I had an M1 mac to play with. I think optimised ARM chips on platforms is going to revolutionize the portable pc market and maybe even shake up the desktop as well--so long as it doesn't fracture it with implementation specifics that differ from vendor to vendor significantly</div>
