Kinda related but I like this ID system that https://urbit.org/ has, each user has an Urbit ID which is used as a username, network address, and crypto wallet. Last I checked, https://zeronet.io/ was the same in that regard, you have an ID which can be transferred to multiple devices so you can post as *you* from your laptop and desktop, the idea of having a single *thing* used to login everywhere and authenticate as *you* is great.</div>

    <div class="md">People are working on this. Old school P2P is not anonymous, true.

IPFS has plans for Tor-style anonymity, but they are on hold until after 1.0.

Supposedly SAFE Network is anonymous: https://safenetwork.tech/fundamentals/

There's a file sharing and chat network built on I2P, which provides anonymity: https://muwire.com/</div>

    <div class="md">If IPFS is implemented with actual decentralization (no centralized control of file versions and ownership) then you have far greater security issues than people being able to see your IP. The only way I see to fix this defeats the purpose of IPFS.</div>

    <div class="md">That only works for static files that don't need to change (like music for example). For something that is live or potentially would receive updates the questions arise: Who is allowed to update the file? How do you know the file you're looking at is the most up to date version? How do you know that the updated file is actually legitimate or safe? These are all questions that IPFS, as far as I know, has no solution for which renders the entire protocol useless in its current state IMO.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, to me the only thing new that IPFS introduces in its current state is that it brings p2p elements into web browsing (and I wouldn't even be surprised to discover that isn't new either), but its goal of decentralizing the internet is far from being achieved.</div>
