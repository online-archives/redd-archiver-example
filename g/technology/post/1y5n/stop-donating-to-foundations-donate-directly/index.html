    <div class="md">I was looking at a repository for an Open Source ventilator this morning; so I browsed the issues to see if there was anything I could tick off this afternoon as I have a spare few hours.

The first issue I saw was someone requesting a *Code of Conduct*. Something that contributes absolutely zero to the project, suggested by someone who contributes absolutely zero to the FOSS community, on a project which is actually quite admirable and should really be placed above people's petty identity bullshit.

I wouldn't mind if this person held those beliefs and felt entitled to make the suggestion based upon their own involvement with the project, but he's yet another serial abuser of the PR system - just finding projects to copy/paste a Markdown file in to. </div>

    <div class="md">I worked for some of these. yes they take your money as if it was income to pay themselves and use a little bit for the rest.

yes its a scam. all big non profits are making you believe you give to a good cause while you just give to the man. of course same for wikipedia, they have millions that they must use yearly yet they have these huge "omg donate or we die" ads. in the meantime the editors work for free, but the nonprofit employees do not and get 500k to millions depending in the job.</div>

Oh you mean like **today**? Funny you're talking shit about EFF being useless while [this](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/crocodile-hunter-4g-stingray-cell/) is currently on the front page. They're doing the [Ring database](https://www.zdnet.com/article/effs-new-database-shows-you-what-tech-local-police-are-using-to-spy-on-you/). They were the first backer of Let's Encrypt (and are the creators and maintainers of certbot). [They are really active, actually](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/electronic-frontier-foundation/company_overview/overview_timeline)</div>

    <div class="md">I donate to the EFF for their legal defense and lobbying efforts related to digital rights.  Not because they make a couple of browser extensions.

I don't like the woke-ass bullshit, but its everywhere. The entire tech industry is infected with it. The people that disagree with that BS roll their eyes and keep their mouths shut. If that weren't the case there would be more cases like James Damore when someone pushes back against woke HR.

I haven't heard anything anti-male or anti-white from EFF, but I've admittedly not seen their speakers at any tech conference. Not saying I don't believe you, but I think if it were something truly egregious it would have been publicized signalling to the unwoke crowd to stop donating to this sexist/racist organization. If its the kind of woke-ass shit we hear from HR all the time, we're probably already desensitized to it.

Just because an org. has a crazy blue-haired wokester presenting a talk, doesn't make it representative of that organizations culture as a whole. There are absolutely pockets of crazy people in tech that are louder than all the reasonable voices.</div>
