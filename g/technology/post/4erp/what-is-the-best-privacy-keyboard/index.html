However I have some major gripes about it, personally:

Convoluted settings interface, No way to turn off latin key longpresses yet still keep symbols, If you turn off key longpress to get more options you literally lose some typable keys(like semicolon)...

What I do like about it though it really does shine:

The dark theme is slicker looking than any other FOSS keyboard themes, One of the keyboard layouts places an apostrophy next to the letter L(It takes some getting used to, but trust me when I say this made typing quickly on a smartphone way quicker), customable keyboard height, split keyboard(although it should be default on landscape mode), and probably a lot of other killer features that are small but important.

I should note well that I make ZERO use of word suggestions/corrections/etc. I just want to type for Pete's sake!

I have tried alternatives, such as Hacker Keyboard, Simple Keyboard, OpenBoard; but none of them are quite as good, even if they have a small plus here and there. I'm talking terrible appearance(theming, material themes are SHIT), no apostrophy next to the letter L, no split keyboard, etc.

Any suggestions?</div>

    <div class="md">I used to use simple but after you mentioned it in this post I tried open board and after configuring it to my tastes I really like it - so thanks. Though one thing I miss a lot about FOSS keyboards is the absence of swipe. I really loved how that worked on gboard. But hey, that's the sacrifices we make =).

So yeah, since you mentioned not liking simple and open I've got no suggestions for you.</div>

    <div class="md">AnySoftKeyboard does support swipe (under "Enable gesture-typing [BETA]"), but I've found it to not work nearly as well as the spyware keyboards. I have to be more accurate in landing exactly on every letter and it often selects words that are both uncommon in English, and would never fit in context. Still, I haven't turned it off.</div>
