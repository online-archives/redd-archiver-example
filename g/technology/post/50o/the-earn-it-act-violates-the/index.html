    <div class="md">> "However, the EARN IT Act’s “best practices” may effectively coerce online platforms into proactively scanning users’ accounts in order to keep the companies’ legal immunity under Section 230. Not only would this result in invasive scans that risk violating all users’ privacy and security, companies would arguably become government agents subject to the Fourth Amendment."

Generally, I do not think that Ruqqus is coerced by more than zero coercers into things like https://www.ruqqus.com/post/4xh where Ruqqus is refraining from deploying something related to images for fear of getting dehosted, referencing claims that MAGAImg was dehosted by users posting CSAM for sole purpose of framing MAGAImg as a CSAM content distributor, however, given that, for example, Imgur remains hosted, and not nonfunctional like MAGAImg.net, I am curious how the EARN IT act, or related concerns, are related to Ruqqus to be legally immune from being liable for violations, especially as it relates to privacy.

For example, I do not consider that anyone has much of any privacy whatsoever for using Ruqqus, such as by facilitating for distributing CSAM and then claiming that more than zero information at all that exists on Ruqqus platform is in any way able to be claimed as private, and that both Ruqqus and any and all users should respect their right to privacy, including that which may account for any hiding or concealing of traffic, such as using Zombie Network hacked/compromised PCs to relay traffic through, VPNs, Proxies, etc.

I am curious though, from perspective of implementing anti-CSAM, why it seems so difficult or time consuming or expensive. I kind of expected that it wouldn't be a difficult process to set up.</div>

What the fuck?

Why should or would or could an industry that is marketed or agendaed to symbolize offering anti-CSAM technology services to protect everyone from being colludingly accessoried/accompliced to aid and abet facilitation of CSAM distributions be practically extorted to either pay up for the access to protection, or otherwise try to implement protection one's self, but I wouldn't be surprised if probably these types of efforts would be somehow predatorily targeted by persons to try to predatorily indoctrinate that everyone must comply to pay the incredibly expensive prices for anti-CSAM services,..... </div>
