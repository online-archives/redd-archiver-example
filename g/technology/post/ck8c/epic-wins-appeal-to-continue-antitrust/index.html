    <div class="md">I hope EPIC fails miserably across the world.  They agreed to Apple's TOS when it came to developing their apps.  They chose to use them.  THEN they choice to try and cut Apple out 100% by having their own inapp purchases so that they get to keep 100% of the proceeds.   Apple did try to give them a sweetheart deal but Epic refused it and said they wanted it all.  Period.   This isn't about side-loading it is about can developers create their own store to purchase content for their games / apps without paying Apple.

It should be a hell no.   Apple made it all possible, setting up the infrastructure and made it available to all developers to make money and still give Apple their cut.   No developer should be allowed to bypass that.  It cost Apple billions to develop, to get it to market, and to maintain it; why should they be cut out of the loop when it comes to pricing?</div>

Oh no somebody think about the trillion dollar company! The people working on Xcode get paid regardless, likewise if I pirate a film, the people working on the set which helped to create it don't get paid more or less. Its funny how Virtual Studio, IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse etc is completely free yet I don't see their maintainers living under bridges and eating from dustbins.

If I create an app and make it free, I still pay $100 a year to have it hosted on App Store, also every app has the exact same fees despite some getting more downloads than others. Hosting an app which gets a few downloads is dirt cheap, I could even use GitHub to host the file. Why can't we sideload? Lastly, you don't pay to release software on MacOS, I wonder why hasn't Apple cried that people are bypassing fees here.

Do you want to know something even funnier? Apple cries when you avoid their fee/ tax yet they do the exact same https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53416206</div>
