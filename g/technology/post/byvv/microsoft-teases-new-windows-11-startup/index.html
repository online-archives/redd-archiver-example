    <div class="md">It technically is, I'm trying to work this out myself, I don't know if this is a different platform entirely or it's just a big update they're trying to sell as Windows 11. It has me very angsty and I wish Linux would deal with all the compatibility problems with Windows software and games otherwise I would have switched to it in a heartbeat :(</div>

    <div class="md">Linux mostly has. I've been Linux only since February and with steams proton thing, I've been able to get all steam games to run without any effort. For everything else lutris has had an installer that worked for me.

You can check https://www.protondb.com/ to see how well the games that you play are working.</div>

    <div class="md">Nope, I've tried it believe me, twice, the database is a lie, you can 'technically' get it all working if you try enough don't get me wrong, but the frustration and misery just isn't worth it. What would be fantastic if there was some way to just get around most of the bullshit, these solutions Linux offers just isn't friendly to the end user if they're new at all. The final straw for me was not only that visual studio wasn't properly supported which I need for my work and then to add insult to injury when I tried going back and using their 'built in' USB image writer software it corrupted my windows 10 install. If I hadn't happened to have other PCs in the house I'd be fucked.

This is something that Linux users need to get serious about reconciling when it comes to new user that are earnest about ditching Microsoft. I love open source software and use it as often as I can, I'm currently using for my game development nothing but open source stuff for my asset creation, I'm on unity for now but I'm learning Godot and will be doing my later titles on that. I'm sorry to say though so far every version of Linux I have tried is absolute cancer. When developers properly support the software it works fantastic and exactly like you'd expect it to but all these work around are just going to piss off new users and make them retreat back to Windows. I shouldn't have to make a ritual sacrifice with a newborn baby just to get my favourite games working. Part of my problem is I've grown to hate steam so I avoid it now as much as possible, ironically despite Linux being open source and windows being the exact opposite I've found it easier to use windows to get around all the bullshit of software developers than I have with Linux.

Nothing compares to how nice it feels to double click an .exe file and have it all work exactly as you'd expect it to, a lot of Linux users just don't seem to understand how unpleasant it is making the switch and having to deal with all of that crap.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s the opposite for me. When ever I try to use Windows nothing works right. It’s really slow. Updates interrupt me. Doesn’t have all the Unix tools I need. Wsl is to slow. 

Don’t use visual studio.</div>
