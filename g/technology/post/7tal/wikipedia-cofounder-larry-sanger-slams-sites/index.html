    <div class="md">The left have a single big advantage in that they are over-represented in academia and information technology.  I would say that they dominate on the internet because they are smelly, sedentary ne'er-do-wells while the right tend to be out in the real world actually doing things but perhaps that's unfair. 

But anyway this is at the core of what they do-control language and opinion, to alter reality to their satisfaction.  The over-focus on fascism and Nazism and the glossing over of e.g. Soviet genocide has become so endemic now it's as if history has been actually rewritten.</div>

    <div class="md">> I would say that they dominate on the internet because they are smelly, sedentary ne'er-do-wells

I would argue that it's demographics. 

There is a rural-urban divide around politics (urban people are more left-wing, and that effect increases depending on size of the city), an age divide (young people are more left-wing), and a wealth divide (wealthier people are more left-wing).

Now, which demographic groups would you say are most likely to (1) have access to the internet, and (2) be able to spend the most time on it? You guessed it - young, wealthy urbanites. Youth is associated with digital literacy (and lack of job means more free time), wealth can also be associated with more leisure time and better connection speeds, and urbanism is also associated with access to the internet.

I want to strongly highlight the urban divide, because it's something often overlooked, but it is one of the biggest influences on political values. Yes, you *can* be conservative in a city, but overall city-dwellers have a much higher average of "progressives" than village-dwellers. By all means, we could argue why (is it just because progressives move to cities - i.e. correlation doesn't equal causation - or is it an actual effect of the social atmosphere?), but it's still a correlation. 

Either way, it is certain that urban populations will have higher internet usage than rural populations, by virtue of having better connection speeds due to the infrastructure, being more likely to have any access, and being more likely to have had access for longer. On that side of things, just think of where the initial users of the internet will have came from (once it gained mainstream appeal): New York, Los Angeles, Chicago; London, Berlin, Madrid, Paris etc. - the size of these cities allows their populations to dominate, and their worldview to dominate also, especially when the rural populations that would often counterbalance them in their respective countries simply haven't gotten access (regardless of wealth, regardless of age) to the infrastructure at that given point.</div>

    <div class="md">I've noticed a lot of it lately, totally unrelated things adding in bias, like an article on ball point pens will say something like, "and trump used a ball point pen to agree to the attack on the capitol." 

Wiki's always sucked for relying on secondary published sources anyhow. Look up the Haymarket Riot and how they keep reporting misinformation and even threatened to ban the expert on the riots who proved most media was wrong.</div>

    <div class="md">The wiki article on Chivalry has some arbitrary contributions to affiliate it with the KKK like:
>"Many considered lynching chivalrous.[66]"
 
There's a lot of modern opinion with questionable citation that seeps into the historical pages.</div>
