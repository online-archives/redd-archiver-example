For that, you need to put in some extra efforts in web designing and SEO Melbourne. In this article, we have compiled some most effective tips and tricks that effortlessly help you improve your design today and allow you to create more meaningful projects in the future.

**Responsive Design**

There are many reasons why you need a responsive design, and the main goal of all of them is to improve your website's branding and user experience. A responsive website means a website that offers an excellent user experience to the users on various platforms, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. It helps reduce bounce rate, increase traffic and [boost website conversion rate](https://understandingecommerce.com/top-seo-strategies-to-increase-conversion-rate/). A highly responsive website also leads to a higher ranking on search engines and brand recognition. 

**Mobile-friendly Designs**

Maybe your website is doing excellent on the desktop, but what about your user’s mobile phones? The usage of mobile phones is drastically increasing with each passing day, and people are using them for various purposes such as internet browsing, online shopping, office work, etc. If your services and products are not easily accessible to your user's mobile phones, you will lose the trust of your customers. Screens of mobile phones are short compared to the desktop, so it is crucial to design websites that can fit all the screens properly to give a better user experience to your users. 

**Color contrast and layout**

Your website's color contrast and layout speak a lot about your brand. Choosing unique and balanced color contrast in your website helps increase brand awareness on digital platforms and increase trustworthiness among users, for example, Apple, Samsung, Coca Cola, etc. These brands are well known for their uniqueness. You can follow various other website designs as a reference and identify your brand uniqueness before moving further. You can also brainstorm with your web developer to create a unique website for your company. 

**Create smart landing pages** 

Website landing pages are the first window where a user lands first. Your website's landing pages or homepages play a significant role in your business branding and user experience. It will include various elements such as header, footer, visuals, text, call to action, etc., where you need to work smartly. Attractive landing pages always gather user’s attention and motivate them to take actions that automatically improve your website user experience and help you get positions on SERPs. Designing a web page could be challenging if you're not technical enough, better to take help from web design experts for this job. 

**Loading Speed** 

Innovative designs sometimes may result in the slow loading speed of your website, resulting in a bad user experience and google ranking. Slow loading sites can not only affect your organic visibility but also lose your brand credibility. You simply can't afford this if you aim to get a higher ranking and branding. But you can solve this problem by hiring a website developer to tune your cache and improve your site's loading speed.  

**Promote white space**

A website loaded with visual elements, content, graphics, etc., can lead to boredom, and your user will move to another site. To avoid this, promote white space in your website by increasing gaps between visual and text elements. It will give relief to your eyes, raise interest among users and increase the engagement rate on your website. Brands giving value to white space on their website are performing great on search engine rankings and making higher profits than sites that are not. It is also the fastest and easiest way to improve your design.

**Simplify your website** 

Nothing better than a simple website with a clear message. Relying on complex designs and aggressive colors can fade up your goal of designing a website and also deliver an unclear message to your users. But a simple website with sober colors can lead to a better user experience, higher conversions, and a clear message delivery. Simple, easy-to-understand websites are easy to optimize and help achieve your business goals quickly compared to complex websites with a number of elements. 

**Conclusion:**

That's all for the day! I hope that all the instructions mentioned above in this article will help you improve your website and achieve your business goals in 2021. Start implementing these marketing strategies to develop highly responsive websites, and don't let your site look out of place because it can equate to your business.</div>
