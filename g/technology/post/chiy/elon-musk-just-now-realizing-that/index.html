    <div class="md">Fucking morons don't understand AI that's the problem, as much as I respect Elon Musk as a human being people really do need to get their heads out of their arses about the limits of AI and how it can be used in real life. They should be used for automated factories and very sparingly for autonomous vehicles at most, never a complete abandonment by a human being and if they lose their signal or an error pops up they should just immediately shut down not start wondering off on their own. The modern AI is really just a set of numbers and a computer at best and still incredibly stupid if they encounter something unexpected.</div>

You mean the guy who promised a fully automated assembly line and found out it was too hard... is struggling with the automation of an infinitely more complex problem?

    <div class="md">Right, because success as a businessman is intrinsically tied to how safe your self driving vehicles are. 

Fun side note, since it'll tickle your funny bone: prototype Tesla was not his invention, or even his idea, he just provided funding and marketing. Yet he's lauded as the next genius inventor rather than the sponsor he is. He's like Mark Cuban, except people give him all the credit because he made PayPal once upon a time.

Nobody is treating Jeff like he's a rocket scientist even though he built his book selling website from scratch, and Blue Origin has a NASA contract.</div>

    <div class="md">The problem is the moment the AI encounters something on the road that a programmer didn't account for that means there's going to be an even worse disaster than if it were a human because AI simply aren't adaptable because it's just a string of code. This is what most people don't understand about AI programming generally, take for example the fact that a tesla car couldn't see a white lorry I believe it was coming straight at it, it's because tesla hadn't accounted for something like that or the technology hadn't been tested in that area. 

How many more gaps are there? You're not taking this into account when dealing with the issue of AI in the slightest and the annoying thing for me as a programmer it's way more difficult to explain this concept to a normie who's convinced AI is going to take over the world. AI is extremely efficient at doing predictable tasks, not ones where things can change constantly with unexpected variables.</div>

Then quit contributing to the misuse of buzzwords. Tell them "AI is a misnomer. We don't have AI. We have fingerprint-scanners. You push your thumb on the scanner and the machine does what you expect it to do, unless it doesn't recognize your fingerprint. Except the scanner is a camera, and the finger print is any given image. If the fingerprint scanner doesn't recognize the fingerprint, it won't do anything, even if it's supposed to. In the case of a car, it might not recognize a Semi coming head on, even though it's supposed to. Or that stop sign has a banana in front of it, so it isn't a stop sign."

> AI is extremely efficient at doing predictable tasks, not ones where things can change constantly with unexpected variables.

No it isn't. Pattern Recognition is not AI. Machine Learning is a baby step towards AI. AI could be a problem, the same as any random unchecked person with virtually limitless technological capability. 

We're about ten to twenty years from any semblance of true AI, especially if we keep insisting the output of any self modifying software must be human-verified after each iteration. Immagine if a child had to be 'paused' for a week to a month, for study, every time it encountered some new thing or situation... How long would it take the child to reach adulthood?</div>

    <div class="md">I agree with you but unfortunately if you don't use the term AI people don't understand it, the damage has already been done, though perhaps I should maybe be one of the few people to be stubborn about it and stick with the correct terms. The problem then comes though where you're spending several hours explaining the difference between 'real' AI versus machine learning versus as you point out a fingerprint scanner, people just don't understand it so they just jump to conclusions all on their own and won't listen to the people who do.</div>

    <div class="md">Nah, the comparison is systemically flawed.

AP drives most miles in a very easy and safe highway environment. No pedestrians, no crossroads, no domestic animals, no traffic lights, no snow, no heavy rainfall, etc. Just drive at a high speed, racking up those thousands of miles really fast with minimum risk and frankly minimum self-driving.

In contrast "human miles" include everything like urban environments and miles driven there are absolutely incomparable to miles driven on the highway, both in volume, difficulty and risk.</div>

    <div class="md">A bigger problem than "AI" and "Self Driving" is the fact that most of these new technologies are internet connected. I won't trust any of these systems because of that reason alone.

They need first at least to be air-gapped and only updatable by visiting your local car-repair location.

The sheer security risk of having your car being remotely hacked to drive you off a cliff or cause a terrorist attack unsuspectingly is just too great.</div>

    <div class="md">No duh. I've been talking shit about Musk's self-driving scam for years, facing Tesla fan boys who have secret info straight from Elon and are waiting for the FSD rollout that is just around the corner. Not only did Tesla brutally underestimate the scope of the problem, they also resigned on dealing with the most difficult part of the problem without which there will be no self-driving cars on public roads.

Mark my words, there will be generations of Teslas with pre-paid full self-driving package that will meet the end of their life not having received that update. The coast-to-coast demo that Musk promised in 2017 for 2018 (IIRC) will not happen before 2030, if ever.</div>
