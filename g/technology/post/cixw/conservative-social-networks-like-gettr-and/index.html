> I’m also beginning to wonder if all these apps are their own grift in a way. Loudly launch a site no one will ever use, claim it’s a free speech sanctuary for Republicans, do the rounds on all the right-wing news outlets, and wait for it to fill up with the worst people on Earth, refuse to moderate it, wait for Apple to ban it from the App Store, and then go back to the right-wing news outlets and screech about liberal cancel culture impacting your ability to share hentai with white nationalist flat earthers or whatever.

    <div class="md">I had nothing but bad experiences with Parler.

I probably can't even recall all of it but of what I can recall...

- They have "Delete" and "Deactivate" options. Both Deactivate. 

- When they came back from being shut down, you could not delete your account. Support wouldn't respond to anything either. Eventually they did respond to me and claimed they would delete my account.

- About a month later I got an e-mail from Parler suggesting accounts to follow. I was able to log in an delete my account. But this means they did not delete my account.

- A few weeks later, I got an e-mail from Parler with announcements and encouraging me to follow Parler Support. My account is finally "deleted" (probably just not active) but their e-mail system is independent of the actual site and there's no mechanism to let them know who is and is not active on the site. 

It's a mess. 

I'm sticking with Minds and Ruqqus. MeWe seemed okay too. I just don't want too many accounts.</div>

    <div class="md">the article claims that Parler's problem was moderation when clearly the main problem was that it was removed from the Google and Apple app stores. Of course downloads went down lol. Google and Apple's moderation killed it. And it sounds like Gettr's issues are mainly technical, not moderation.

Nice try but we don't want another authoritarian platform, get outta here with that censorship bullshit</div>

    <div class="md">Stating the obligatory, I believe that the vision of a forum predicated on freedom of speech is not utopian. It's my strongly held belief it's never been executed properly. I refuse to participate in any website with content moderation beyond what is enforced by law.

The websites which fell were either destroyed by the mob/oligarchs or the leadership were incompetent and inspired by money. The foundation of this idea couldn't be stronger. There are literally *millions* of Americans desperate for a competent free-speech platform. If the platform prevails with principled leadership it would be a juggernaut rivaling big platforms. Parler's initial skyward ascent proves it. 

Not one owned by corporate heads like Rumble, not one engineered to enforce a zealots ideological views like Gab, not one which brazenly defeats the purpose of the website like Odysee, or some half-assed knockoff like SaidIt, and honestly, not one that ignores its userbase over and over like Ruqqus.</div>
