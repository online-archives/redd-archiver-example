      <div class="md">With Apple deciding to move all their computers to ARM it is only a matter of time until they stop selling the Intel versions. Now people can build hackintosh PCs right now because Intel, AMD are willing to sell their processors to anybody. However Apple will not let you buy the ARM processor separately(Even if they did they would charge you through the nose). Finally when Apple stops releasing software updates for OSX and their other programs based on x86 architecture, is the day Hackintosh community is effectively killed off. The new operating system will not work on the Intel and AMD chips no matter what you do.

So hackintosh folk have 3 options now. Either learn how to use Windows and become Microsoft's bitch. Or shell out thousands of pounds/dollars/euros for hardly repairable authentic Mac and become Apple's bitch. Or learn Linux and live with the pain of not having enterprise-grade software available on your platform.

Before any smart-asses try to tell me Apple will support the Intel based variant of their ecosystem for the next 7 or 10 years, look at the date when Apple switched from PowerPC to Intel and the date they released the last OSX that supported PowerPC architecture. You can defend your favourite company all you want. The reality is that after 3 years they will take massive dump on your head and will be unapologetic about it.</div>

    <div class="md">Short answer: Apples' MacOS applications tend to be very good, very well-maintained, and cheap compared to equivalent competition. For example, Final Cut Pro X is a perpetually licensed, stable, useful video editor from 2011 that is still improved and updated now, for not a penny extra. The OS is also generally nicer to use than Windows.</div>

    <div class="md">That might be a chicken-and-egg problem.  No one's going to build motherboards for a CPU that isn't accessible.  If Apple put the chip up for sale, I bet someone would make a motherboard for it.  FWIW, these would probably target niche/high-end configurations rather than trying to compete with Apple's volume on the low end of the lineup.</div>

    <div class="md">>Linux doesn′t have Enterptise-Grade Software

I think I know what you′re trying to say, but the statement above isn′t true.

Now to say that Linux lacks Professional Creative Software is somewhat true, if you mean Adobe software. However Linux is catching up in that field, with other professional companies releasing native Linux editions. This is at least in the Video Editing and DAW fields.

Also I have had a very much good experience using GIMP and Inkscape. GIMP should be approaching it′s version 3 release at some point in the nearish future; which should bring in a lot of interface polish.</div>

    <div class="md">First you say it's not true and then you slowly admit it is true. No point in lying to yourself. GIMP and Inkscape will not catch-up to their proprietary counterparts because they don't make any money. Firefox can compete with Chrome because Mozilla makes somewhere between $400 to $500 million dollars per year. For that amount of money you can hire many good developers. Adobe Inc. made $11.17 billion in 2019 and has over 22 600 employees. Now I don't know how much money the GIMP project gets in donations but I can guarantee you it's not even a fraction of what Adobe makes. People need to eat and pay bills. Most of people don't want to work for free. All these programs that are developed by volunteers can never compete with something that has paid full time developers behind it.</div>

    <div class="md">You're right in that open source projects of love don't make near the revenue their proprietary counterparts make. You are correct that for true professionals nothing but adobe products will do.
But there are many casual uses where GIMP/Inkscape will go far and even surpass the big name software; foremost because they cost $0.

But you seem to have entirely ignored my Video Editing/DAW Arguments. Davinci Resolve has a native linux edition and is a direct proprietary competitor to Adobe's equivalent offerings. Waveform for one example in the DAW field has a linux edition.</div>

    <div class="md">Lots of Macs exist today with intel processors, so Apple will be doing both Apple Silicon and Intel support for a long time. Like a decade.

Windows can be run on ARM, so ARM processors for desktops might become more popular in the next 10 years.

Apple is about to be broken up due to legal issues.

Apple's ARM processors have built in x86 emulation hardware that are a neat trick of computing. (I'm trying to find the article I was reading but here's another one: https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2).</div>

And who told you that? I don't remember Apple supporting PowerPC architecture for 10 years after they switched to Intel. 

>Windows can be run on ARM, so ARM processors for desktops might become more popular in the next 10 years.

That doesn't change anything in regards to my original topic. It may be better for competition since x86 licence is held by only 2 companies but OSX will only run on Apple's ARM chip. Don't worry they will figure it out.</div>

    <div class="md">Denial? Dude, almost all of the world's servers that aren't using Windows Server (not many use Windows Server, but it is worthy of mentioning. Its market share is in a nosedive) are running some variety of a GNU/Linux operating system. You can run basically anything on GNU/Linux one way or another too, from Photoshop (not natively, but that's barely noticeable) to video games. It's only getting better. Windows's days of relevance are numbered since Microsoft has started going heavy on the Linux stuff (subsystem for Linux, .NET Linux compatibility, etc). Apple is slowly phasing its server out of existence, not to mention that everything you can do on Mac you can do on Linux except iOS development, since Darwin is in no small part a bunch of stuff ripped from BSD and friends. 

The only people left without much native stuff on Linux-based OSes are hardcore gamers and creative types, but that gap isn't really one worth filling right now since so few of those people use (let alone know about the existence of, with few exceptions) Linux-based operating systems.

You could definitely run an enterprise on Linux alone. Microsoft and Apple not required (unless you want an iOS app).</div>

    <div class="md">I used to work in tech support for 3 years. I'm sure the big businesses use Linux to run their infrastructure but the small-medium sized businesses run Windows server 95% of the time. They need Active Directory to control domain accounts. They need a Windows VM for Sage which is a popular accounting program. They need a VM for Veeam Backup & Replication to backup all the files and virtual servers. Many of them still have Exchange servers which run on windows. Although this has mostly moved to Office365 so it's becoming less and less relevant. Software for many 3D printers works only on Windows and Mac. There are probably thousand more examples that I am not aware of. Linux VMs are usually used for web servers that run Apache and NgineX.  Video games are only for consuming. You can't use them as a means of creating new content.</div>

    <div class="md">Blender is free and it's pretty much the industry standard for 3D modeling and animation software. 

Free software != Unprofessional software

In many companies X software is chosen because "everyone else is using it too" to avoid compatibility errors. An example of this would be Windows 10 itself. It could be argued that a noob friendly distro like mint would be better for basic office work along with libre office because it's cheaper (free), way more lightweight so less money can be spent on office PCs, and updates aren't such a pain in the ass. Stable, efficient, and cheaper. 

Sadly pretty much no one uses Linux in corporations, so nobody chooses it, because muh standard</div>

    <div class="md">Ahhh.... yes Blender. You forgot to say that Blender has development fund that is backed by some of the biggest companies in the world. Like Amazon, Intel, Facebook. I don't know how the fund works but I believe the big corps give them large chunks of money and Blender devs implement desired features for them. https://fund.blender.org/ Right now the fund gets 1.6 million Euros per year. That's not a trivial amount.</div>
