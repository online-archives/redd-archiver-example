First steps toward a complete ban on high powered general purpose computing.

This obviously also affects:

* Crypto mining
* AI research
* High-end graphics workstations (CAD, 3d graphics)
* Game design

Yes you can still build your own, for now. But if this causes a decrease in the demand for high-end parts sold, they will become even more expensive.</div>

    <div class="md">They actually define a formula for allowed power consumption: https://energycodeace.com/site/custom/public/reference-ace-t20/index.html#!Documents/section16053statestandardsfornonfederallyregulatedappliances.htm#vcomputerscomputermonitorstelevisionssignagedisplaysandconsumera5.htm

This is absolutely nuts.

It also mandates the following for workstations and "small-scale servers": "Transition the computer into either the computer sleep mode or computer off mode measured in Section 1604(v)(5) within 30 minutes of user inactivity." Is that going to be enforced by the hardware or software? How the fuck is that appropriate for a server?</div>

A gamer that uses a high-end prebuilt pc that lives in California...good chance they look a bit like the average redditor. Fuck em.
