I know quite a bit on the DSL side, but not too much on the wireless side. I am *not* interested in generalities, but *engineering specifics*. I can and will sling acronyms with the best of them, so please don't hop in unless you've got *specific technical knowledge*. I'd rather have no responses at all than anyone just making shit up. It's perfectly okay if no one here knows. This is a shot in the dark; nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

The foregoing is not ***nearly*** as hostile as it might sound. I just don't want to waste time with Reddit-level horseshit. The ideal people who could discuss this would be those who are WAN-educated and experienced. Even better yet, those who have either worked for a telco or worked closely with the telcos. Thanks much in advance. </div>
