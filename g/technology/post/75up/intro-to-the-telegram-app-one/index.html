Telegram now has 500 million monthly active users, which is more than Twitter & Reddit.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_platforms_with_at_least_100_million_active_users

Popularity has been skyrocketing.

- [https://files.catbox.moe/0oxskl.png](https://files.catbox.moe/0oxskl.png)

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)#Usage_numbers

Telegram is used around the world by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, anti-Putin activists in Russia, dissidents in Iran, etc.

Several Presidents & Prime Ministers now have channels on Telegram, including Israeli PM Netanyahu, French President Macron, Brazil President Bolsonaro, etc. Bloomberg News also has a channel on Telegram.

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b169V30Ox18

Donald Trump Jr created a Telegram channel a few days ago, and he already has nearly 1 million followers.

Telegram is run by a billionaire free speech libertarian & digital nomad, who moves around the world on a St Kitts passport. His goal is to bring free speech & privacy to all 7.5 billion people on the planet.

Compared to Gab & Parler, the Telegram app is far less likely to be banned because:

1. Telegram is politically neutral, while Gab & Parler were biased activist apps. Gab has right-wing sources hardcoded in their trends section. And when you signed up with Parler, the app would suggest that you follow some right-wingers like Sean Hannity & Ted Cruz. Telegram doesn't have anything like that.

2. Americans represent only 2% of Telegram's users, and right-wing Americans probably only 1%. If Apple & Google banned the Telegram app over a handful of right-wing American posters, it would create a huge international backlash. After all, Telegram has 500+ million monthly active users worldwide, and many Presidents & Prime Ministers have active Telegram channels for communicating with their followers.

Here are some channels I follow on Telegram. They tend to be true nationalist (right-wingers willing to criticize Israel / AIPAC / Jewish Power).

NOTE: Telegram requires a phone number to sign up. So if you're going to signup your dissident username, it probably makes sense to:

1. Get a 2nd phone number (Google Voice is free. Skype Online Number is $5/month. Burner App is 7-day free trial, then $5/month). NEVER give this 2nd phone number to friends, relatives, work contacts. ONLY use this 2nd phone number to signup your dissident persona on services like Telegram.

2. In the Telegram app, under privacy settings, make sure to completely hide your phone number.

Personally, I have two accounts on Telegram. One account is my real persona & primary cellphone number, which I use to communicate with friends, relatives, work contacts. My 2nd account is my dissident persona & 2nd phone number (which I haven't given to anyone). Telegram app makes it easy to manage multiple accounts.

If you don't want to deal with phone numbers at all, then it's probably best to stick with Gab.com, BitChute.com, Poal.co, Ruqqus.com, etc</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, you can use a physical burner phone, purchased from your local convenience store.

But I prefer to use an online service/app (Google Voice, Skype Online Number, Burner App, etc).  This is because a physical prepaid phone purchased from a convenience store might not work overseas, while an online service/app will work anywhere in the world, wherever you have internet access via laptop or smartphone.  Plus, a physical burner phone is extra clutter, takes up limited pocket space when walking around a city, is an extra thing to charge, the battery will eventually die after a few years, etc.

Keep in mind, if you want to maintain your Telegram account for the long-term, you should maintain control over your 2nd phone number.  Telegram accounts are tied to phone numbers.  If you "burn" your burner phone number, it will create problems later if you want to sync up your Telegram account on new devices, etc.</div>

    <div class="md">Telegram is a Russian app. Even if they are booted off from the big tech market their presence won't fade. Am on Gab too, Gab is good. Just they need to overhaul the complete UI and add new features.</div>
