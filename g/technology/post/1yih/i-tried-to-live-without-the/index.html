    <div class="md">Let's do an exercise! 

* First let's fire up that VPN. I'm using Windscribe, but whatever you prefer is fine.
* Duck Duck Go (search)
* Shop directly from manufacturer web stores (instead of Amazon, can still use for ratings)
* I'm still allowing for Overstock, Houzz, Wayfair, Lowes, Home Depot, and Newegg because they don't feel like "the man"
* Eat only Dominos Pizza. Not relevant to this list, but very hungry right now.
* Gotta find the Dominos, guess I'm migrating back to MapQuest. Wait, no, owned by Verizon. I guess the Mapbox integration in Duck Duck Go is fine.
* LineageOS phone
* F-Droid app store
* ProtonMail rather than Gmail/Hotmail/etc
* Signal Messenger client for communications
* Arlo doorbell and cameras (Netgear instead of Amazon or Google)
* Ubuntu computer
* Ruqqus, Minds, Parler, Gab for social media
* Instacart for groceries from local places
* Did I mention I'm hungry right now? Might be affecting this list. 
* Spotify
* Nintendo
* Screwed on game streaming since Twitch is owned by Amazon, Mixer is owned (and closed) by Microsoft, all that's left is Facebook Gaming or YouTube. Just watch your friends through a Discord channel while on a VPN and a fake account.
* Crap, I forgot about YouTube. Is Vimeo any good now? Wait, Dailymotion is still a thing?
* Streaming with Philo, maybe Pluto TV
* Cartoons on Crunchyroll? Nope, owned by AT&T. How about Funimation, is that still safe? 
* Let's bring back Monster.com and MySpace.com

What else did I forget?</div>

    <div class="md">- Firefox for browsing. Not Brave like a lot of people suggest, it's a Chrome derivative.
- Install ublock origin, HTTPS everywhere, and privacy badger on browser.
- System76 sells their own machines with pop_os linux installed and coreboot.
- Return to the age of piracy.
- Also, Signal isn't that great unless the people you are texting are also using Signal. I had a hard time trying to convince my friends to care about their privacy.

    <div class="md">> Not Brave

> it's a Chrome derivative

It's a Chromium derivative, which is safe. The reason people see Chrome as dangerous is that Chrome is Chromium with all of Google's tracking bullshit added in. Chromium is open source and trustworthy as long as you can see what the group that makes a derivative (Edge, Brave) does with the code.</div>
