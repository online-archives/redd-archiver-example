    <div class="md">Were I Mcafee I would do something like this.

Have 3 or 4 servers sitting somewhere with the data on them. I'd create a simple program with a password screen and give 5 or 6 different people a password, probably all lawyers who are legally bound to act and not talk to the Man. Upon entry of any of those peoples' passwords a 1-2 month timer would start (to make sure that no one entered it wrongly). At the end of that period, those who entered the password would be transferred a sum of money a set of dick pics (it's mcafee), an email would then be sent to various newspapers, governments and hacker groups with access to the data on the servers. The end and fuck you to anyone in the files.</div>

    <div class="md">If you don't need it to trigger instantly, you could set a longer timer, which will protect you in case you are unable to get to it for a while.

The most important things are to make sure nobody knows where your program is, and make sure nobody knows when it will trigger or who gets the files. This is easier if you don't disclose that you even have a dead man's switch. You can also use a red herring like telling people that your lawyer will release documents. But don't give any information that could allow an adversary to block distribution of the information.</div>

    <div class="md">I could encrypt files and send to select people, or make public. It would be complete gibberish to read without a passphrase to decrypt. So the files are out there, but the key to unlock isn't. I could write a simple script on a remote server that would countdown towards a given date/time, and then once it hits that date it would email the decryption key to a mailing list. To reset the timer I would need to connect to server and reset script. There will be other ways, no doubt, probably involving lawyers/trustees.</div>
