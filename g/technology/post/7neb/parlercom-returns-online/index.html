    <div class="md">When they got the notice that they'd be shut down...they had ample time to create a backup from their AWS. They still had access.

The fact that they didn't is truly indicative of how incompetent they really were/are.

This doesn't take into consideration the soft warnings they got from Amazon for months leading up to the final notice.

Smacks of 2 parts retardedness and 1 part laziness.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, more than ample time.

I ran a software shop with "terabytes" of data, in AWS. Took 3 hours. You have snapshots already setup in AWS. Built into the basics of the service offering.

See here:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html


This was truly epic levels of incompetence on their part.</div>

Hanlon's Razor: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

They shit the bed. Plain and simple. Didn't think 3 days ahead. Just the here and now. "We can put a halt to this! Get the lawyers!" Instead of, "Needed to have done Business Continuity Planning because this shit happens all the time to conservative voices."

Read the history of Parler to see what I am talking about. Just gross incompetence and absurd levels of arrogance.</div>

    <div class="md">I heard this on the Dan Bongino show. If you don't know, Bongino owns a chunk of Parler. He said after they were shut down, Matze was spreading lies like he always wanted to ban the Q-Anon people but others wouldn't listen. And Matze was also warned multiple times it was a bad idea to do business with AWS but never listened to the other stakeholders and never had a plan B.</div>

    <div class="md">> mainstream conservatives only promoted Parler, never Gab

Yep tells you all you need to know.  Replace "mainstream conservatives" with sold-out traitors, and it makes perfect sense it was a trap.  

Gab has proven itself by having an owner who is insanely based, and no backing from the Mercers.</div>

    <div class="md">So it's basically a program, platform, ect. usually launched by some kind of government organization (think CIA, FBI, ect.) Which aims to collect information on people. 

A honeypot might be for example an illegal marketplace on the dark web set up to catch people who use it and turn them in to the police, or a poorly secured website used to catch hackers. 

IMO Parler is a honeypot, because to sign up for parler you have to give your phone number, which then makes it possible to identify you very easily by the gov. It also started becoming big around the time conservatives started being banned from social media, questioning the US election results, talking about protesting, ect.

So when you put 2+2 together: 

+ Convenient timing around the peak of protests

 + requiring a phone number to set up (easy ID)

 + choosing amazon as a host for a conservative social media platform

 + going offline for like over a month

 = quite a convenient way to get a lot of info about the population and process/store it while disguising it as a ban.</div>

    <div class="md">Well, I don't really have any hard evidence, but the whole thing seems just.. off. Idk, something in my gut tells me to stay as far away from it as possible. 

Also, there's the fact that from what I see pretty much all US conservatives are promoting parler exclusively, and I'm automatically suspicious of stuff that gets promoted by mainstream celebrities and politicians. Nobody needs to use Parler, and IMO they should stay clear of it for at least a month.</div>

    <div class="md">this is a fact and fucking annoying. i'm less worried about the shenanigans of that guild tho, cause ATM they're "wannabe authoritarians' while the SJW and MSM types have become actual 'practicing authoritarians'. it wont stop the guilt by association logical fallacies sadly. If you support freedom of speech at all, be it left or right, you will eventually be 'erased' by one extreme or the other and i'm unsure of how to resolve that problem since balance/centrism is doomed to impermanence.</div>

    <div class="md">yeah, the most known instances are pretty leftist. That's why i think they should create their own instance, so they could set their own rules without getting banned by anyone; the only thing other instances (like mastodon.social or mastodon.online) could do, is kind of shadowbanning them from their feed, but you could still see their content if you actively follow them.
(i hope you could understand what i tried to say and sorry for any grammar mistake)</div>

    <div class="md">I think what you're describing is the way gab worked for a long time.  It federated with mastodon.  They probably stopped supporting federation because most servers blocked them.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh i didn't know they were federated (i didn't use gab), but there is no point in giving up with mastodon. I mean, if they make their own site, people should have to enter there to watch it; in mastodon, even people from instances where Gab is blocked could watch their content if they follow them (and people could sign up on their instance just as they would do on a website). That's why i think mastadon is cool: instances could block you from their feed, but you can still run your server freely with your own rules (as long as you don't post anything illegal like child pornography)</div>

    <div class="md">The fediverse is a far more robust free speech solution for social media than Parler, Gab or any other centralised platform. Parler and Gab will only be all about free speech as long as it suits them, all it takes is a change of heart or leadership to turn their heel on that promise. Twitter and Reddit both made the same promises in their early days. With the fediverse, that freedom is systemic, nobody can override it.</div>

    <div class="md">It's a 'honey pot', a trap.  Parler demands a real phone number and won't allow a VoIP (i tired 2).  After sign up, you either must or only in some cases must, give an ID.  This is crappy.  Don't trust it.</div>
