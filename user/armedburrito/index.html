The only way 'Gen Z' will be more conservative, is if you and your Taliban buddies manage to destroy public schools, and make all of America dumber.  As people get more educated, they are more likely to be liberal, and the only way you can counter that trend, is by sabotaging America's future.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Sure bud, with all these recent developments, that the top minds in T_D have found, I'm sure it's just a matter of time before they put the puzzle together.

Let's ignore the fact that most of reddit was smart enough to learn from the Boston Marathon bombing that reddit is not full of sleuths, just computer nerds with too much time for conjecture.  Let's also forget that his family has told you guys to fuck off.

Let's also forget that FBI director, who many blamed for Clinton's loss, was removed, for refusing to drop an investigation into Flynn, somebody with obvious Russian connections.  You know, the investigation that's happening with professionals, and not a bunch of dumb hicks on reddit?

Seth Rich may have been killed by the DNC, I dunno.  What I do know, is that you guys are not sleuths, you're neckbeards in an echo chamber.  What I also know, is that Seth Rich is not in any way relevant to current events or even T_D.  It's an obvious smoke screen, so you guys can pretend there isn't an impending impeachment.

Notice how all the guys who are 'on your side,' have ditched or switched?  Chaffetz?  Comey?  Flynn?  

Keep telling yourself you're getting close, just like you guys are in favor of American ideals, while mostly being religious idiots who refuse to allow for criticism or free speech.

You and your ilk are the American Taliban.

If the rest of T_D was so confident of that, maybe there would actually be posts about the current events, instead of spamming the front page, and r/all with nonsense about Seth Rich and HRC's emails.

Let's be real, T_D is flailing so much, because even FOX news has started reporting on the investigations and Russian connections.</div>

Trump and his supporters already lost.  T_D and its members are a perfect example.  The admins don't have to nuke your posts.  You're already losers, and most of America already thinks you and yours are dead weight.  

I don't have to convince anybody, I just have to wait for all the old, uninformed assholes to die off.  Only problem is, the American Taliban knows they're losing, so they don't care about cheating to win, and they might permanently damage American institutions in the process.</div>

Mistakenly thinking he's an idiot?

Only an idiot wouldn't be able to tell the Trump is a moron.

Obama may not have been great, but the main reason more benefit didn't come, is because the American Taliban has gerrymandered its way into controlling more of the government, with less of the votes, just like the guy who lost the popular election, Trump.

High taxes?  What a fucking retard.  Why don't you MAGA and bring America back to the 50's when the effective tax rate for people like Trump was over 50%.  You have bought every talking point, hook, line, and sinker.

If you were an American who hung out with actual Americans, this wouldn't be news to you.  Considering that you are probably the type who spends a lot of time in T_D, I can understand how you have lost sight of what it is to be a decent human being, let alone an American.

Sorry you and your fellow American Talibani's bid for power is being rejected.

Edit:  Lol, you're saying _I_ won't have the influence I seek?  There's a reason T_D is bringing up Seth Rich and Hillary's emails still, months after the election, it's to hide discussion of the current events, that are more and more pointing to the fact that Trump isn't just a dipshit, he's downright evil, and selling American security away to satisfy his machismo.</div>

Your opinion is not valid just because it's your opinion.  Your opinion does not deserve respect, just because it's your opinion.  Just because you can vote, and string a coherent sentence together, doesn't mean you aren't a moron, or are deserving of respect.

You voted for Trump.  I though Clinton was shit, sure, but I was never stupid enough to think Trump would be a decent president, and if the last few months are any indicator, I'm right.

I'm not a bigot, you are free to have you opinion, and I'm free to think you're a fucking idiot, for it.  You sound like the religious right.  Pissing in everyone's faces, and then when you get called on it for being a piece of shit, suddenly it's everyone else's fault, and you're being persecuted.

Just like your shitty president.  'Yeah, I'm an incompetent idiot, who's clearly in bed with the Russians, but the real problem is, who told you?'

You and your ilk are an embarrassment to real Americans.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, exactly.  If it wasn't your little safe space, echo chamber, you wouldn't be able to circle jerk irrelevant, unresearched, untrue bullshit to the front page, despite the fact that the majority of reddit thinks you guys are incompetent idiots, and history will prove us right.  If you didn't have your little safe space, you would actually have to deal with real issues that are brought up, like the deepening links between Russia and Trump.

I'm all for free speech, but T_D isn't, and then complains when other people censor them. 

hint: You weren't being censored.  Reddit, along with most intelligent Americans, think Trump is a piece of shit, and his followers are even worse, i.e. T_D.  That's why your bullshit, no-content posts get spammed to 0, once /r/all sees them.  

Trump has thoroughly shown he is a corrupt piece of shit, and T_D brings up Seth Rich and Hillary's Emails, and circlejerks them to the front page, even though Trump WON.  You know why you guys are circlejerking the Seth Rich and Email stories still?  Because the present reality is too hard for you to accept.  Trump is a failure, and only fucking idiots support him, and even though there's a better and better chance every day, that he's going to be impeached, you guys fucking ignore current events, so you can stick your thick skulls further in the sand.

Rot, you fucking un-American, piece of shit.</div>
