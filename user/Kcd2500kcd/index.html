You must also have forgotten where you used those exact guns as a defense as to how Ukraine can defend itself from Russia before changing your mind and thinking they are tossing quarters at the enemy.

Where did I say a single glock would stop it? My god you are a dense old one aren’t you.

If the law was changed it wouldn’t be illegal gun ownership. Wanting to update the law is NOT the same as advocating for breaking the law or are you too stupid to understand that? 

Go ahead and report me for nothing you dope. The irony of you calling anyone a coward is hilarious when you openly admit to being the bitch of whoever has a gun near you</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are correct you don’t but you should and the fact you are already willing to roll over even in a made up scenario says a lot about you as a person.

Do you think a man in a tie or a woman in a pant suit is bulletproof?

You believe they should just roll over though since guns won’t stop Russia therefore Ukraine should just fold and give up.

To believe violence will not be necessary in order to create or maintain a “civil” society shows not only ignorance but also cowardice. You are far too old to speak to others about the future when you got like what 3 days left? Of course it wouldn’t matter to you if everyone else falls into an actual dystopia you have no skin in the game and therefore no leg to stand on</div>

You did. I mean terribly but you still did.

Well by the sounds of it if they broke down your door the only thing you would do is ask what flavor boot polish they have on I hope you have no one that depends on you.

Man what a point Ukraine should just give up go in Russian control because guns don’t work I also agree no more money should be wasted on that war still has nothing to do with the US</div>

You do know that we have the right to bare arms in case the government becomes tyrannical so please explain how defending yourself from a tyrannical government isn’t self defense because if you could read you would notice how I used self defense(usually meant as individual self defense and not defense against a government) and 2A separately yet you still tried to conflate the two unsuccessfully. But hey if you aren’t using that spare tire then you are just a danger to me and everyone else around if you don’t give it up y out will need to be arrested for treason</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">According to who? You? Who is this we that do not use nor need guns? Because the majority of people do need them whether that’s for self defense, hunting, or keeping them or what the 2A is actually meant for. Just because YOU believe they aren’t needed now does that mean you will never need them? I guess I should just throw away my spare tires since I don’t need them now and I’m a safe driver so I will never need it and everyone else should also just get rid of their tires. Better yet just throw away the cars like I said I don’t need to use a car right now so I will never need it right?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well yes because the last time we outright banned alcohol that worked out just fine. Also banning alcohol wouldn’t stop others from using their vehicle as a deadly weapon or stop them from driving under the influence of another drug so the only sensible option is to get rid of every car in the world. Also cameras don’t stop criminals if it did we wouldn’t have so many criminals on tape doing illegal things. Your persistence on dying on a hill that is essentially “bend me over big daddy government please give me more boots to lick I trust you” is wild</div>
