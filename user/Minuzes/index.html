Have you seen exactly the comment that got him banned?

Why not just delete his comment? Why go to the extreme and ban him? One other moderator said you often just delete comments. Please explain why or how did you see enough reason to ban him for such a general example contextualized in that point of view...

Tell the rest of us so that we don't make the same mistake. 

Don't you think that banning him for such a comment isn't turning you guys into the people you often ban? I mean it is also sexism to label something as sexist when it is not.

 In a few more years people will start being banned just by referring to someone as he or she, male or female...</div>

Why didn't you just deleted his comment? Why the ban?

You might agree or you might not, but considering the topic, that is a well contextualized example of what might happen if this gets a huge amount of spotlight! 
If he had said the same thing but instead of neymar he had said Scarlett Johansson would these mods react the same way? 
We are living in an age where people cant express themselves anymore, everyone is getting offended by the simplest things nowadays...

And these mods, jesus! what kind of justification is that? Where is the link to the actual comment or comments?? You can't ban someone without at least showing exactly what they did wrong! 

Don't feel bad mate there was absolutely nothing wrong with your comment.</div>
