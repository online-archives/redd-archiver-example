    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It isn't alien to reality, it's alien to you because you're probably college educated.  You live in a bubble I'd assume.  I'm not excusing anything.  I'm stating the fact that I don't remember. It's ridiculous to assume you can remember something that happened more than a lifetime ago.  You say you remember, but I'm calling your crap.  You don't remember.

You're right that a bad government will take your rights away.  That's what the second amendment is for.  A bad government is not an authority figure.

I'm saying the Washington post is absolutely not a credible source of information.  I'm saying there is no such thing as a representative democracy.  Don't qualify words like democracy because it's mental gymnastics.  General rule of thumb is that if a word needs to be qualified it's because it isn't true.  It isn't a democracy, it's a "Representative democracy".  So democracy? NO. "Representative democracy"? Sure, once I figure out what that means.  It means elected representative.  It doesn't mean that it's a democracy.  Liberals like the washington post for some reason think inventing new terms is legit and it isn't.

That doesn't make me a bigot, it makes me correct! Like I said, we'll have peace if they are not in the west.  In the west their ideology is worth killing them over.  We have to protect ourselves.  If you showed me a point I was being dismissive towards by saying something like "well they're all the same" then I would agree with you about the word bigot.  I'm not being dismissive, I'm stating that we need to eliminate the enemy.  The government and the west in general don't really appreciate differing political ideologies.  We hate islam for the same reason we hate communism.  If you don't like individual rights or the principles the west stands for then we're happy to let you leave (referring to Islamic ideas, not you specifically).

I already answered your question about communism.  You believe a communist idea (democratic values) are a good thing.  They aren't.  Democratic values are a sick and ineffective idea as well.

I'm extremely undemocratic because I support he values of the west.  I haven't gone against the American constitution at all, although frankly I wouldn't care if I did.  A dangerously intolerant and discriminatory political ideology (Islam) has no place here.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I absolutely do not remember how women, black people and gay people have been treated in the US.  You don't either.  Most change doesn't work out very well in my opinion, we'll have to agree to disagree on this point.  Rights are not something other people can take away.  Freedom of speech means you can wave your tongue to make noises.  The only way to remove freedom of speech is to remove your tongue.  The rights we have are recognized and not granted.  That's a very important difference.  Rights were not made up from democratic values.  I don't care to discuss the topic of democratic values any longer because you aren't understanding that democracy has no value in the court of law.  An inalienable right by definition cannot be taken away. You need to accept terms like "god-given" and "inalienable" to be an accurate description of rights.  It is fundamental to the western way of life.  The minute the US stops being a democracy our rights will be gone? WRONG.  That wouldn't be true even if the US was a democracy (which it isn't).  We have courts to protect our rights.  By the way, I appreciate the video you sent me about democratic values because I gives me an idea of what you're talking about.  I think the logic is backwards because a free individual is capable of participating in a democracy and not the other way around, but we'll have to agree to disagree.

Dude do NOT trust a damn thing you read in the washington post.  I actually already saw that article.  It's just stupid.  There is no such thing as "representative democracy".  You can't make up words and expect it to prove your point.  A representative democracy is not a democracy.  A better term would be "elected representative".  Democracy literally means "direct democracy".  The word "democracy" never needs to be qualified with words like "direct" or "representative".  If you need to qualify your words then you know you aren't saying something accurate.  I'm not going to play the mental gymnastics needed to read articles from the washington post.  A great debate tip is to never qualify your terms with other terms because it's a great way to lose the debate.

The word bigot is an ad-homonym especially because it has no supporting evidence.  You can’t explain why I’m a bigot, you just have that automatic emotional response.  An assertion of such a thing is mean-spirited and assertions aren’t worth very much in a debate unless accepted by both sides.  I reject your accusations of bigot and believe that you in fact are a bigot based on generalizing very different things as the same thing.  Let’s be clear, I’m NOT talking about a third of the worlds population.  For the last time, I’m talking about Islam which does NOT describe a person or group of people.  Islam is an idea that deserves to be criticized.  You’re the one talking about people and groups of people (like Rwanda, Uganda, Iran, and Saudi Arabia).  There is a huge difference between speaking about a group of people and speaking about an idea.  One is bigoted (you) and one is not.  You’re also comparing me to groups of people which isn’t accurate and certainly doesn’t make any useful points in this discussion.  I would encourage you to show me thinking is the same as that in Iran by actually showing me how it is the same as Iran and not with spineless assertions. You’re wrong, in Iran they consider individual rights to be a foreign concept.  Please name one things I’ve said that is hateful.  Also, define “hate” for me because that’s a mean-spirited word as well.  I don’t hate them.  I want them to live.  If they come here we’re going to have a war so they should go back where they came from and we can live in peace.  Honesty is a type of love.  Which words could come out of the mouth of an Imam if they were swapped? I challenge you to find one sentence or idea I’ve said where that is true.  I think you have a strong emotional response to people who have different world views that you do.

Communism is another liberal principle that causes war.  Liberals are advocating for things that (if successful) will eventually lead to large numbers of death.  It's just a history lesson.  We need to avoid war and obviously avoiding these liberal ideas is the easiest way to do that.  Also the United States killed communists rather recently.  Communism is not a western value.  Communism and Islam are both not compatible with western values.  You’re preaching communist ideas as a western value! It’s important to realize democratic values are communist in origin.  Democratic values are not a good enough reason to censor the free speech of an individual.  Democratic values are un-American although I know we disagree.  I think the takeaway is that I don’t consider democratic values (like equality) to be a valid point within this debate.  I know you think I’m wrong about that so lets agree to disagree.

You absolutely were bashing Christianity.  You think you can compare Christianity to Islam? HA.  You might not consider that an insult but it’s insanely incorrect and offensive.  Islam is not wonderful when practised in the "right" way and in my opinion Judaism isn't either.  I don't think it's fair to say "right way" without acknowledging the doctrine of these religions.  I don't want animal sacrifices, peoples hands cut off, or intergenerational punishment.  I definitely don't want honour killings, a double standard for men and women, and slavery.  Both Judaism and Islam have really awful doctrine.  Islam essentially preaches intolerance to those who are not Islamic.  Muhammed killed people to spread his religion.  He was a tyrant and a warlord.  You can't convince me the worship of a serial killer can be done in the right way.

I agree we could use less religious influence.  I specifically believe a doctrine of hate and intolerance should be abolished.  Freedom of religion isn't superior to freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech will always trump freedom of religion.  The obvious example of this is because freedom of speech comes first and freedom of religion comes fourth.  The constitution can be prioritized by the number of the amendment because that is the order it was amended in.  I'm a big believer in freedom of association and not freedom of religion (which is in-American of me) because I think it is more clear and effective.  Canadians have freedom of association and not freedom of religion and it seems to be far more clear from a legal standpoint.

This is a technicality but there is no basic western democratic principle of freedom of religion.  It is a constitutional right and not a principle.  Freedom of religion fortunately does not protect a religion in it's entirety.  They have the right to their faith and their worship and that's pretty much it.  They don't have the right to associate together in a mosque (they do in Canada, which is a better system).  They don’t have the right to believe the United States should be destroyed while also being protected by the constitution of the United States.  Faith and worship are fine, but Islam is a POLITICAL IDEOLOGY as well as a religion.  Islam is a political theocratic dictatorship that spits on the United States and everything the west stands for.  We’ll agree Islam as a faith and worship will always protected.  Their political ideology is worth killing them over.  It’s preferable to tell them to go back where they came from then to kill them.

TL/DR: democratic values like equality are BAD for a country.  I don't consider the Washington post to be even someone trustworthy or informative.  A bigot refers to groups of people (which I am not).  Democratic values are bad (again) because they're communist and not a part of the United States government.  Don't compare Christianity to Islam.  Freedom is speech is #1 while freedom of religion is #4.  Islam is not protected by the constitution because it is a political ideology.  Saying "Islam" is just a religion is very incorrect.</div>

You have no idea what you're talking about. They aren't even close to the same age. Islamic teachings include violating human rights. Those teachings will never co-exist with the western world.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It is NOT the job of a democracy to protect the rights of an individual.  You're simply making that up and it couldn't be more incorrect.  The government does not protect your rights - the courts protect your rights from a government that is constantly violating them.  A democratic value and a right are not the same thing.  A "right" specifically refers to something in the constitution which was created by a non-democratic leader being either god or the founders of the United States.  Human rights are not a value, freedom of speech is not a value, and freedom of religion is not a value.  These are rights.  We don't need democracy to uphold these rights, we have a court system with judges who are appointed to do so.  Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are values, correct.  They are not democratic values because the democracy did not create them.  I am not religious, I don't believe I am a bigot and I am definitely not a fanatic by any means.  I consider this whole conversation to be very simple: **I have the right to free speech and it will not be taken from me at any cost up to and including death.  I'll kill to keep it.**

Individuals must band together to create change.  That's true but who cares? Change is usually bad.  The system we have is pretty good, so changing it would be a bad thing.  If we have perfected it then changing it would mean changing it for the worse.  Most change is bad, and change for the sake of change is horrible. "Creating change" sounds like producing change that wasn't necessary just for the hell of it.  I have no desire to create change.

The courts will protect you from a government official who is violating your rights.  You're missing the point - it is documented in the constitution of the United States that you have the right to rise up against your government if they violate your rights.  The whole point is that individual rights are paramount even if you have to kill to keep them.  Individual rights are totally a thing, while collective democracy doesn't really have rights at all.  I wouldn't fight for an ever changing democracy, I would fight for an absolute right that is recognized by our courts.

I don't care if you believe in god, the term "god-given" is well documented as the reason the United States has a constitution in the first place.  It is un-American to consider "God-given" rights a deal breaker. You can be an atheist and still respect that the country of the United States respects individually liberties that have a higher calling than something a human being could make up.  The easiest way to explain it is this: If you were the only person on earth, you could say what you wanted, own as many guns as you wanted, have any religion you wanted, ect.  Rights apply to an individual even when they are alone.  I say that constitutional rights are recognized as being God-given because that is an undisputable fact.  If you don't agree then you don't agree with the constitution.  As a citizen of the United States you believe these rights are inalienable and granted to us humans by a higher power.  You don't have to believe in god, just that we exist as a result of a higher power (possible evolution) and such powers granted us a body, a brain, a food source, and inalienable rights.  They were given to us when we were born even if only by evolutionary chance.  You can't call "God-given" a deal breaker because it accurately describes the constitution of the United States.  Is the constitution a deal breaker for you too? I certainly hope not.  Stop deciding "what you think is right" and start evaluating facts.  Even if I did believe God delivered the constitution the same way he supposedly delivered the ten commandments that does not make me a Muslim or equivalent.  It might make me equally stupid but the similarities end there.  You obviously know nothing of Imams and Muslims other than you consider them stupid and unreasonable.  If person A wants to kill everyone and person B doesn't really want anything, but both person A and person B believe God hand delivered instructions to humans then are those two people the same? NO.  You have to be one hell of a bigot to say that makes me exactly the same as an imam or Muslim.  Stop generalizing people because its really ignorant and makes your opinion less valuable because you are unable to be specific.

The United States is not a democracy.  These are very simple facts.  Your unwillingness to acknowledge a very simple, obvious and easily researchable fact is disgusting.  You're clearly blinded by your beliefs.  You don't want to know if it is a democracy or not do you? Just GOOGLE IT.  The United States is a constitutional republic with a representative democracy.  So people vote in someone to represent them as part of the republic.  The founders created a republic and openly bashed democracy continually.  Liberals make up words like "direct democracy" and "representative democracy" like those were real things.  A representative democracy is not a democracy.  It is a representative who was democratically elected.  That does not make the government a democracy by any stretch of the imagination.  The term "elected representative" is far more accurate than "representative democracy".

You can continue with the ad-homonyms if you want but they aren't an argument and believing you can compare me to something to make a point is foolishness.

You aren't a patriotic American because:

1.  You believe democratic values or group think is a valuable political tool which is a communist idea.

2.  You're defending the enemy that the United States is spending tax dollars to go to war with.  Let's be clear that Islam is the enemy of the constitution and therefore your enemy as an American.

3.  You consider "god-given rights" a deal breaker.  That's the stupidest thing you've said in this whole discussion.

4.  You don't know or accept obvious facts about western society.  It isn't a democracy.  It really is ALL about the individual rights.  It's the foundation of our society.


You aren't a very good debater because:

1.  You clearly don't know anything about Muslims or Islamists.  You defend them and insult them.

2.  You use bad examples when trying to bash Christianity.

3.  You believe bashing Christianity somehow is helpful to a debate about western values and constitutional rights like free speech.

4.  You make ridiculous assumptions about me then tell me how stupid I am for believing something you simply assumed to be true that obviously isn't.  Maybe you were stupid to make that assumption.

5.  You make too many points with a question mark.  You cannot present an argument by making ridiculous comparisons and asking rhetorical questions.

6.  You avoid points I raise by addressing them with ad-homonyms and bigoted remarks like "all the same".


If you care to continue I won't be responding until tomorrow, I have a lot of work ahead of me to do.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I do not understand why my views belong in Iran or Saudi Arabia.  I don't think they would go over very well there.  The way I think about Islam is not the way they think about Christianity.  That's a stupid assumption and it is incorrect.  Christianity does not violate their individual rights and freedoms.  It is absolutely not the same with swapped names for religions.  You have created a false equivalency likely driven by your emotion toward the issue.  I'm going to continue to repeat that Christianity and Islam are not comparable and are definitely not equivalent.

I know my views on individualism are enshrined in the constitution.  It is very clear on these matters.  There is no room for interpretation. I find it humorous that you believe the individualism is a conspiracy created by corporations.  We have no fear of democratic ideas in a society that values the individual over the group.  Communists value the group over the individual, and capitalists value the individual over the group.  You're preaching communist doctrine and you're pretending that western civilization agrees with you.  The west rejects group think and democracy because it is tyrannical.  The United States uses democracy to select representatives within the republic.  The system is not a democracy, but a republic with a democratic representative.  Change is not a valuable metric, because the point is not to create change.  I may never be successful individually protecting own rights, but I have the right to kill in order to do so.  It will not lead to a long jail sentence if I am in fact protecting my own rights.  The constitution and the courts will protect and individual from the government.  It is possible to kill another human being legally given the right circumstances.  Obviously I wouldn't recommend it.  The point is that an individual can kill to protect individual rights as per the constitution.  This makes it obvous that individual rights are paramount.

I absolutely spit on democratic values.  Please provide one example of a democratic value as I can not think of any to spit on.  I associate democratic values with meaning the will of the majority or group.  I spit on the views that others can tell me what to do or how to live my life regardless of their leaders and large numbers.  I believe Saudi Arabia and the commonwealth/United States equally have no respect for democracy.  We already have a theocratic monarchy in the west, why would I want to move to a theocratic monarchy such as Saudi Arabia? Maybe you should suggest I move to England instead.

I am attributing the teachings of Islam with Islam.  There are many countries that suffer from a lack of moral's and ethics, but they also suffer from a lack of constitutional freedoms, human rights and capitalist opportunities.  There are many reasons we do not want their influence in the west.  Let's keep these morally deprived ideals away from western culture.  The ideals of Islam are not compatible with individual rights or general principles like the rule of law that we hold sacred.  Rwanda now has a large Christian influence which was not prominent until AFTER the genocide of 1994.  I think Rwanda is a bad example for you to use.  More Christianity would be a great thing for Rwanda because they are so morally deprived.  In the west we would not benefit from more Christianity, we already have enough as it is.  The influence of Christianity has done very well for us.  We are wealthy and tolerant.  Muslims can live here and become citizens if they value our individual freedoms and our capitalist values.  That's very tolerant of us considering we are bombing the countries many of them are from.  We understand they do not want their culture and would prefer our culture instead.  We accept those who are willing to assimilate.

I have not attributed anything to Islam.  I am directly referring to the beliefs of Islam.  I do not accept Islam as an idea because I accept individual freedoms as an idea instead.  The two are not compatible.  You need to pick one because there is no middle ground between the two.  We were born as individuals and we will die as individuals.  Individual freedoms are said to be "god-given".  You cannot remove these rights under any circumstances.  Islam wants to remove these rights.  I don't think you understand bigotry, please provide an example of something negative that applies to the west or to myself that I have attribute to something foreign.

"Individual rights are a part of democratic values. They are an idea we've made up, along with freedom of speech and freedom of religion."  You may or may not be correct, but in the west that is irrelevant.  We believe these values are god-given and human beings recognize them implying we did not make them up.  Maybe we did, but we believe we did not.  You're born individual and you die individual.  If you were alone on the earth you would have the rights we have recognized.  We don't believe other humans beings can take away something you are born with.

The constitution is there to protect us from democracy.  They are two opposites; you cannot equally respect both.  In the west we believe that democracy has value unless it infringes on our constitutional rights.  Respect the constitution and use democracy as a tool to select your representatives.  They both serve a very different purpose.  In Islam, you would have neither democracy or a constitution.  

Islam needs to be repelled and removed from our culture.  We create weapons to kill those who attempt to take away our freedoms.  Our ancestors died to give us these freedoms and they did an awful lot of killing.  Your liberal views (I assume - you have no explicitly stated but I assume) are inviting in a culture we will go to war with.  Let's avoid the war by keeping them out.  Understand it is the liberal view that creates a need for war.  If we kept Islamic ideals away from the west then we would let them live in peace.  We don't want them to die, we want them to stay far away from us so we stay at peace.  If they go back where they came from then I wish them no harm.  If they think they can come here and remove my rights then they have something else coming.

Please understand that I am not saying western culture is better than Islamic culture.  I'm saying they are different and incompatible.  You cannot believe in both.  You cannot cherry pick good things from both sides because they fundamentally disagree with each other. I assume you're college educated based on your views and assure you that you have been lied to.  We do not fight intolerance and discrimination, we do not believe that creating change for the sake of change is good, and we do not value group think.  Wanting to "change the world" is a very dangerous and extreme idea that frankly only college kids are stupid enough to believe.  The west doesn't need change - we need isolation from those who wish us harm.

Sorry that was so long, I just hope you can appreciate a constution that prioritizes the individual over the group.

EDIT: Democratic values are subject to change (which is bad) while individual rights are absolute.  God given rights never change.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Here in the west we have freedoms that religion and democracy cannot infringe upon.  I think an anti-Islam view would not go over very well in a dictatorship or theocracy.  You know nothing or Iran or Saudi Arabia.  Here in the west we have rights that provide freedoms from the democracy.  A democracy cannot infringe upon our rights. That is why we have a republic within the United States and a monarchy in commonwealth countries.  The republic and the crown will not allow a democracy to rule for fear it becomes tyrannical.  We do not fight for democratic values and instead we fight for individual rights.  We must be clear on our individual rights and fight those who wish to remove them from us, be they religious or political.  The 2nd amendment allows those within the United States to fight for their individual rights even in the event that their own country attempts to deny these rights.  If the government attempts to remove your freedom of speech then use your gun to kill them.  That's why the 2nd amendment exists in the first place.

This liberal mentality you have is dangerous to our way of life.  As a people we fight, kill, and die for these values.  We wage war to ensure our rights are protected.  We will not allow a religion or an individual to deny us our rights.  If Islam wants to deny our rights then we will not welcome it within our borders.  We will fight, kill, and die to ensure values such as rule of law, freedom of speech and a public trial are respected.

We agree that fanatical religion is bad.  Anything fanatical is bad.  I believe moderate Islam is bad because it violates the god-given rights of the individual.  Those are both constitutional rights as well as human rights.  Christianity has no desire to do these things and is very compatible with the constitutional and human rights we have recognized.  Islam is not compatible or welcome within western society and rightfully so.  We literally kill people who attempt to remove these rights from us and Islam will be no exception.  If they want peace (they don't) then they should go back where they came from.  There will be no peace for those who deny our rights within western society.

I hope you understand that intolerance and discrimination are not the reasons a religion is bad.  We don't fight intolerance and discrimination - that isn't what our military is for.  We fight those who deny our constitutional and human rights.  Individual rights are superior to democratic values.  You should do some research on intolerance and discrimination within Islam.  Islam will not tolerate those who are not part of Islam.  Islam will enslave those they deem beneath them.  There is no equality in Islam.  You will be discriminated against and they will be extremely intolerant.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't think you're getting the point.  Islam is not something we can be liberal about and it isn't comparable to Christianity.  The results of Islam are vastly different then that of Christianity.  Regardless, this is really about whether or not we can accept Islam within western culture.  The answer is obviously no.  I reject the argument that Islam is acceptable within western culture because we already accept Christianity so there would be nothing different than we already have.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1. Christians aren't really known for abusing human rights. If you're concerned at the way women and gays are treated then you should prefer Christianity to Islam.

2. Muslims are known for far more death than Christians. They aren't exactly diverse because they castrated and slaughtered their slaves instead of freeing them.

3. You don't know my motives, I'm concerned about behaviour because that is far more significant than how crappy a belief may or may not be.

4. If your point is that Christians are just as bad as Muslims then you're actually just agreeing with me in the stupidest way possible. I'm glad we can both agree that Islam is bad.

Islam is the worst. Christianity is irrelelavent to this discussion.

You haven't made a case for the liberal position at all.  Asking hypothetical questions because you think it sounds convincing isn't the same thing as making an argument.  Actually that summarizes the liberal position pretty well.  No arguments, just a condescending tone while repeating "c'mon, C'MON" over and over again.</div>

1. Do you know what the crusade was or only that it caused large amounts of people to die?

2. No one believes Islam are the worst people because "Islam" does not describe people. It's a set of ideas that are the worst.

3. We are already like them. They are just people who are exactly like we are. We have extreme Christians, atheists, and feminists. The difference is the behaviour.

4. I'm not convinced leading by example will deter the desires of the people we only think we're leading.

5. If you think Islam is harmless that is because you are harmless.</div>
