On one hand you would rather save the mother the the baby if her life is at risk and could kill them both.

On the other hand you say fuck the woman who wants an abortion and willing to poison/ drink the baby to death and possibly kill herself too. This also applies to wire hanger or book room abortions infections and contamination is a huge problem. 

If you sinply just let the second person have an abortion your still net positive one person, the mother, who could potentially have more offspring later on in life. 

Wereas you don't care if she dies since she's seeking to kill the baby via drinking it and possibly herself to death. Pretty fucking heartless if you ask me.  

A mole is not comparable to a parasite or fetus nor a living entity in anyway. They don't have potential for 'living', it's a mutated skin cell .  </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So if the mind and thoughts of a person are the desire and removal of a fetus is that not a way the body can manifest that desire and need? Does it need to be an autoimmune response? 

What if the mother threatens suicide with a gun if she doesn't get an abortion who's life is more valuable?

So the mother can drink the baby to death, and there's nothing you or anyone can do to stop that, glad you're okay driving people to poison themselves for something they don't want.

Also there are tons of times when a mother's life is in danger or the babies itself because of nature should we not murder the fetus when the mother's life's on danger?  

An organism that lives and gets it's nutrients from a host, no where does it state anything about being from a different species or similar species.  </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">A parasite can not survive without a host, you keep referring to and calling the parasite growing inside a woman a 'person' , if the woman was killed or died would the 'person' live? No It needs it's host to survive and thus a dependent parasite.  

 Lets make abortion illegal, the mother has the right to drink alcohol that's not illegal, she can drink the baby to death,  is that a better outcome and way to get the same goal?

Anytime something is made illegal prohibition causes people to do it anyway in a non professional manner.   

Stealing is wrong because it impacts people not a parasite growing inside a woman who has the right to do what she wants with her body. Like you said your rights end where my nose begins. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My argument for that it's not murder is that it stems from a moral issue, hence my line after that statement which you neglected. 

For some people life beings at sperm and egg others think not, that's a personal ideal, what science says on the matter is irrelevant because an 'expert' can be found to rally for any side of an argument. 

Like you said some people BELIVE it's murder well some people believe in Thor should we tailor out society to those on the fringes?

Though shall not kill is fucking retarded to claim when this country wages a major war every 10 years. You can't pick and choose where to apply the tenants of Christ if that's something you believe and follow.    

Also if we live in a democracy where the majority rules then how did Trump get elected with less overall votes, it's not so cut and dry. </div>

As a republican im sure you understand the government collect taxes on you. Guess what if you're not healthy and can't work, taxes can't be collected. You're a burden on society. The tax payers pay for that, so your health, my health, everyone's health impacts everyone financially.    

Your bills where not payed for by Obama care because you probably didn't reach the maximum out of pocket, do you know what your amount was vs how much the bills where? </div>

 It didn't cover anything because you probably had a huge maximum out of pocket and until that kicks in you're paying for shit. Many people hit their maximum out of pocket the first second of the new year, I'm guessing you've never been in a hospital overnight, you've never experienced a 6 figure hospital bill.

Do you have car insurance? Have you ever been in an accident? Why should you need to carry car insurance?

 Please show me where you can get a 20-30% discount on Prescription drugs for paying cash.  </div>

If it didn't cover the basics or you didn't have insurance before of course your price went up, you're getting more coverage.


Republicans want to offer stripped down plans that don't offer things like drug coverage, what worth wild insurance doesn't offer drug coverage?</div>
