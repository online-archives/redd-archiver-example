    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">\&gt; EU is draconian for not allowing fascists to deny their crimes against humanity, that's fucking rich.

Yup. Exactly it. Everyone should be able to have their own opinions.

\&gt; Wtf is there to investigate? All evidence was already documented soon after the end of the war.

By Soviet and Allied governments. They are not reliable. Would you trust the PRC on information regarding the Great Leap Forward, the US Government on Indian removal, or, if the Nazi Government still existed, would you trust them on the Holocaust itself?

\&gt; Do you think there are still records or  some sort of evidence lying around at Auschwitz?

If you think that's the only thing that could be discovered, you yourself are being "rich". Cover every claim made by the Allied and Soviet governments. If the Nazis burned 6 million bodies, there's bound to be evidence of mass amounts of ash. If the Nazis gassed Jews, then Zyklon B should be tested to see if it is lethal. Etc.

\&gt; I really don't understand what you're trying to achieve here, besides parroting nonsensical neo-nazi talking points.

Being an American, I believe that all information on everything should be available so we can make our own opinions. I believe in the Armenian genocide because of reputable sources who said it happened. I believe in the Rwandan genocide for the same reason. I cannot, in good faith, say the same about the Holocaust. In the EU, you must accept everything that is handed to you without non-biased verification and if you use this information to come to any conclusion other than what they exactly want to hear, you are arrested for several years. That is disgusting, and not right.

\&gt; And who exactly were these people that supposedly got arrested and censored? Hm?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws\_against\_Holocaust\_denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial)

\&gt; I'll stick my hand in fire at this point that your story about your  family is complete bullshit. If it isn't, maybe you should go tell them  about your views on history.

They know my views on history, and they're in complete support. They similarly believe that if a government has nothing to hide, than they should make all information free and verifiable. The Turkish government denies the Armenian genocide, and was so adamant and trusting in this belief they allowed US investigators. The US investigators found that it was actually ***worse*** than the otherwise best estimates. The main reason I want private investigations is that we can expand our knowledge as much as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

The investigators may find that it never happened, that the information is 100% accurate, that it was actually worse than reported, or find information that we were never supposed to find. Maybe the Allied and Soviet governments have something on their hands that they don't want us to know.

&amp;#x200B;

# If you have nothing to fear, and are secure in your beliefs, why are you so adamant against this? What is so terrible about letting private non-partisan investigators investigate the Holocaust?</div>

&amp;#x200B;

I do *believe* the information, I just refuse to find it credible. I'm making a conscious objection because of the draconian policy of the Holocaust according to the EU. You cannot investigate, you cannot come to any conclusion other than what the government wants you to. I don't find that reminiscent of a government who has nothing to hide, though I find it's more likely that the Germans and Europeans as a whole find the whole situation too disgusting to allow anything else.</div>

&amp;#x200B;

I do however believe accounts of Indian removals, because private and non-partisan investigators were allowed to investigate anything and everything, and they all have their own conclusions. For the Holocaust, that is not a freedom given.</div>
