    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Correct. Ruling that zionism is  form od genocide is as infamous as the UN's declaraton that zionism is a form of racism, lols.

The irony is that Israel will be in the dock now for years to come. Not China for its mass murder of Uyghurs. Not Syria for massacres of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Not Russia for deliberate bombing of civilians in Ukraine. Only Israel, for its efforts to destroy a terrorist group that killed a thousand civilians in the most brutal ways imaginable on October 7, 2023.

The court did not order Israel to stop fighting and withdraw from Gaza. It did not order a cease-fire. What it did order was described this way by the *New York Times*: “Israel must take action to prevent acts of genocide by its forces in Gaza and must let more aid into the enclave.” And by doing so, it lends credence to every claim of genocide, to every lie that Israel is trying to starve Gazans, to every effort to stop the IDF from defending Israel’s citizens.

In today’s Israeli press, there is a dispute as to whether Prime Minister Netanyahu alone, or the whole cabinet, recently approved the entry into Gaza of [thousands of tons of flour, enough for six months’ supply](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-with-ministers-in-the-dark-netanyahu-okayed-6-months-worth-of-flour-to-gaza/). So much for the idea that Israel wants to starve Gazans or is making war on civilians. But this fact didn’t make it into the “facts” upon which the court relied.

With this ruling, the United Nations system has emboldened and energized antisemitism around the world and added to the dangers facing the world’s only Jewish state. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">EDIT: All the soy boys whining about my use of the word, "genocide".

Look, Hamas, and their masters in Tehran, want to kill as many Jews as possible. They have stated this. They have repeated this. They launch attacks in oursuit of that goal.

Meanwhile, we have the anti-Israeli crowd who invokes, all the time, that theres a genocide happening in Gaza. Whewn confronted with the absence of facts to substantiate such a claim of genocide, they, again, all the time, whine that there doesnt have to be a showing intent...its just happening.

So, on one side, you have a stated intent, a goal, an objective, to kill as many Jews as possible and eradicate the state of Israel..even if they are really unsuccessful at it. On the other side, you have a nation state that successfully wages war against maniacs that want to kill as many Jews as possible and eradicate the state of Israel.

We all know who is attempting to genocide in this conflict and it aint Israel.</div>

True, we are sending existing equipment and material...that has to be replaced now. How do we pay for those replacement items - deficit dollars. Now, you want to argue that this aid to Ukraine represents money being put back into the economy...yes, after its been borrowed from another country...and thats if the Democrats (who have been screaming since the early 90s that we vastly overspend on the military) will ever support reinvesting in the military to replace this material.</div>

The same people who argued that the US do nothing in 2012 when Russia first invaded Ukraine let Putin know that he could act with impunity. And these same goblins are standing up tall insisting that while the deficit spend, er, squander hundreds of nillions on nonsensical domestic spending, we can also send surplus equipment that has to be replaced by more expensive material purchased with, again, deficit dollars to be produced by an industry that the Democrats have gutted for 3 decades.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Ok, so now youre shifting from the volume of guns to talking about an increase in gun violence. Besides, until the pandemic, [gun violence had been trending down since 1993https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/trends-and-patterns-firearm-violence-1993-2018](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/trends-and-patterns-firearm-violence-1993-2018) and since 2021 has gone back to trending down. So, IM not sure what data youre looking at, but youre just wrong on the basic fact.

You say that, "Not true. The increase in gun violence is directly proportional to the spike in guns the NRA promoted with "Obama is gonna take your guns away".

We do live in a "police state" of surveillance", but you offer no evidence of this.  Your assertion, "Our violence is directly tied to gun culture" doesnt support the preceding statement and is, itself, an unsubstantiated assertion.

Actual mass killings are exceedingly rare in the US notwithstanding the news media's and special interest groups attempts to classify 2 or more injuries as a mass violence events here in the US. The vast majority of multi-victim incidents are crime-related and not involving real mass killing events. No reasonable person believes that theres a mass shooting event or more per day in the US despite the special interests and news media attempts to brainwash into thinking as much.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Wait, what? We have nearly 400 million guns in this country. A vanishingly small number of those firearms are used to commit violent, let alone murder. In other words, even counting suicides,, not even 1% of the firearms are involved with deaths. Its not even .05%. Its not even .02%.

If you think that the number of guns in this country is why there are *so many* gun-related deaths, then you'd think there'd be an even far greater number.

We have more gun violence and violence, generally, than most other nations because we dont operate a police state or a surveillance state, because our culture is far more violent than almost all other nations.</div>
