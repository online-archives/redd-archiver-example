    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">To make my point clear, I was saying that the "token black guy" term isn't a dig at the character itself - it's a dig at the writers, who wrote a shallow, stereotyped character in the name of being inclusive. Like, "we have to have a black character so we don't appear to be racist, so we'll provide the absolute minimal amount of work in developing the character, just as long as he appears on screen enough so we can appear to be inclusive". 

Calling a character a "generic white dude" is a dig at the character itself, as if there's something inherently wrong with being a white guy unless you have some sort of uber-defining characteristic. 

I don't think the two terms are used in the same way. That was my only point, but now I've been banned for racism, which is absolutely absurd to me given that I've spent years serving in various minority communities and have never let race be any form of unit of measurement when determining the quality of a person. 

Not being allowed to even discuss racial issues in any way is blatant censorship.</div>

Hell, one posted advocated for the main kid having his teeth knocked out and has around 55 upvotes last I checked. Someone responded to him saying violence is never ok no matter who it's against, downvoted around 40 times last time I looked.   


This is unbelievable. THIS is the kind of thing that ensures Trump will win reelection. THIS kind of thing is the reason he won the first time. </div>

There, almost 2 hours of full, unedited context for you to watch.  


Black Hate Preacher spouts hateful and racist rhetoric at everyone, including other black people. At one point, he repeatedly called a black student hanging amongst the MAGA kids an "N-word".   


Hate Preacher mocks Native American's beliefs, chiding them for "worshiping Eagles, the Phoenix, and the Buffalo".  


Hate Preacher makes what could be construed as threats of violence toward the White people in attendance, and repeatedly mentions America's impending nuclear destruction.  


MAGA kids mostly stand idly by, watching, making goofy faces, and occasionally responding, but from a distance.  


Hate Preacher rejects the offer of a hand shake from a MAGA kid and says if he had (something, unsure what he said) in his hand, he'd throw it at him.   


Eventually, Native America and Vietnam Vet Nathan Phillips and a few others wander over to the MAGA group, who are SITTING, beating his drum and chanting. The MAGA kids stand and start jumping up and down, chanting and cheering. Phillips walks right up to the one kid seen in the infamous photo, within 1-2 feet of him. The kid NEVER moved.  


Phillips, who has used his drum and chanting and multiple marches and events in the past, finishes his display and moves on - nobody stops him, nobody follows him. The MAGA crowd remains in place.  


The MAGA group did not say or do anything overtly racist or disrespectful - it can only be assumed that their engagement with Phillips by chanting and cheering was mockery, which it very well may have been, who am I to say?  


Hate Preacher resumes using racial slurs such as Cracker, Corn Bread, Whitey, etc, calling the MAGA kids inbred trailer trash, and so on.   


The media narrative that the MAGA kids descended upon this Native American man is a straight out lie, because they were SITTING DOWN when Nathan Phillips approached THEM and stood within 1-2 feet of the kid in the photo, right in his face. The kid had a goofy, smug look on his face, but didn't say a word, didn't make any gestures, and even nodded a few times. I've looked similar to that kid when people are singing happy birthday to me.  


The media narrative that the MAGA kids were disrespectful and were mocking Nathan Phillips has merit. That is entirely plausible although as I said, the lack of any overt comments or gestures being made by the MAGA kids suggests that they possibly thought they were "participating" in Phillip's demonstration.  However, appearances are everything and it certainly appears that they were mocking Phillips, which is unacceptable.  


The media does not, in any story that I can find, mention the OVERT racism being spewed by the Black Hate Preacher, who used "the n-word" in a derogatory fashion at one of the black kids in the MAGA group (whom the MAGA group surrounded to protect from the hate preacher), or the numerous racial slurs he used toward white people, or the mocking, insulting language he used toward the Native Americans - ridiculing their culture and beliefs.   


So, when people say that the media has an agenda to push, this is what they're talking about. This is EXACTLY what they're talking about. The media has carefully sliced this story to tell a narrative that suggests a group of White Catholic Trump supporters surrounded and harassed a Native American War Veteran for no reason.   


Whether the kids mocked Nathan Phillips or not, now THAT is something worthy of debate. But any media outlet claiming they surrounded and harassed Phillips is FUCKING LYING.  


The 2 hour video above PROVES that narrative is an absolute lie.   


I truly hope you watch it.
