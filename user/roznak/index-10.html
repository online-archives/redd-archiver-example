<p>The best programmers I have worked with were the ones who could avoid using a complex algorithm or adding more dependencies on the technology stack by simply approaching the problem from a different angle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fully agree. If the code becomes incredibly complex then it indicates that maybe you do not understand the problem you are solving. Looking back at the code you want to solve and asking yourself the question what are you trying to solve, will probably uncover design flaws and a much easier way to solve it. </p>

<p>They also lied about 12 months free if you had a subscription that expired less than a year. I did not renew my previous subscription for 6 months and when I took the bait to upgrade to v10 then I got confronted that they calculated from the last paid subscription. So I only got only  6 month instead of 12 months.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with this subscription is that when I don't pay, then I must reinstall an older version, but this takes time and risks breaking my work flow.  If I am in a dead moment no problem, but if I am in a critical bug fix, the last thing you want is your tools to drop out.</p>
<p>My trial time is running out, I think I am going to uninstall it because the subscription model is despicable.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I started to learn about F# long time ago and that is a functional program.  Functional programs are really cool, however I have noticed that when you are so used to the C# and Reshaper combo, using F# or any functional language is actually a drag. </p>
<p>It is not only the functional language that is important, you must also create tools that makes developing it in way faster than conventional languages. Back to the F# example, it takes me exponentially more time to develop in F# as the program grows that if I would use C#-Resharper combo. In the end you ignore the F# (Elm) because it slows you down.</p></div>

<p>That is why Java applications suck on any platform. </p>

<p>The syntax of what you write is less important than the structure of your program. And the structure of your program will define you classes and functions. For every project that will be different. When you develop, you must focus on what your program must do and as a consequence use design pattern if they fit or kick them out when they don't fit.  Not the way around that a design pattern dictates how your program will work.</p>
<p>Where you put your brackets, new lines,.... is irrelevant. Just make it consistent over your project. I use the K&amp;R style because it puts more code on your screen and not waste space. My goal is to have functions that fits into your screen so you can see it in an instance what it does without need of scrolling. </p></div>

<p>You are right in this, these tools are not always in permanent use. It can depend on the type of project. They are a waste of money when you do not need them. But you also do not know in advance when you need them.</p>
<p>Using a free tool like SQL developer is less efficient to use but then again it is a trusted companion always there when you need it. It does not magically stop working if you did not use it for a very long time.</p></div>

<p>You can increase accuracy by reducing the number of operations on the float.</p>
<pre><code>float   a=4.59
float   b=a*2.0*2.0*2.0 
float   c=b=a*8.0

<p>In the example above &quot;b&quot; will have a lower accuracy then &quot;c&quot;. </p>
<p>Also comparing a floating point value comparing it against an smallest value epsilon.</p>

  // never works

<p>From our discussion it is obvious that in order to solve a problem, we need to first understand the problem.

<p>I agree and this is where 90% of the software projects fail. It is actually shocking to see how many developers fixate on design patterns but don't understand the problem they are trying to solve. </p>
<p>But the issue is that during analysis a lot of problems are not very well understood. Or encounter unexpected issues.</p></div>

<p>At last someone that finally understands that the agile madness is destroying your developers team. It does not improve your team, it brings down the team to the worst developer. Of course when everyone matches your worst developer, then you have no way to know anymore if your team has any worth. </p>
<p>I understand where the <em>agile</em> thing is coming from, you are trying to model your best developers, to do exactly like them. Then create some rules and let other repeat these rules hoping you get exactly the same results. But by doing this, you miss the whole point why these great developers are good in the first place: Because they have the freedom to invent and create new tools to build your project. </p></div>

<p>A pity. Still, at least C++ users can manage this by having their coroutine be a class member, and keeping all its local variables in the class so that the scoping is implicit.) </p>

<p>Don't let anyone tell you that C can't do C++.  Long before C++ existed C people were already using things that mimics C++.
C++ basically translates it to C code under the hood. </p>
<pre><code>C++:  MyObject.Foo(int a, int b)

<p>Becomes this. Look at the assembly output so see that.</p>

<p>Of course, this <strong>trick violates every coding standard in the book</strong>. Try doing this in your company's code and you will probably be subject to a stern telling off if not disciplinary action! You have embedded unmatched braces in macros, used case within sub-blocks, and as for the crReturn macro with its terrifyingly disruptive contents . . . It's a wonder you haven't been fired on the spot for such irresponsible coding practice. You should be ashamed of yourself. </p>

As a startup focus on what is important first: Having an income.  Playing with C++ to make the programs better can be done after your startup us successful.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with C++ but customers wants your product cheap and as fast as possible. They don't want to pay for a product that is 4 times more expensive and 4 times slower to develop.</p></div>

<p>The last year Google searches became useless for me. It always gives me stuff I am not interested in. I have to go to page 2 or 3 to finds the real results I want. The first results are either paid targeted advertisement, or results based on my previous searches. But I don't want yet another similar result, I want to explore new results. Results that I did not find yet. Why would I use Google search if I already know the other links? </p>
<p>I have the same issue with Amazon or Netflix. When it proposes new items then yet again it proposes items I already know. It proposes me things that last time I ignored because it is not interesting. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It tries to become too many things and in the end it fails in every single thing. It tries to be too generic. Java clients tends to look like created by a hobbyist compared to applications created in their native language for specific devices.</p>
<p>And sadly enough that is exactly what Microsoft is now doing by dumbing down their Office to these stupid apps Office thing. It tries to run on any device but it it sucks on any device. </p></div>

<p>In F# this is your class method:  <em>member public this.Process(fileToParse : string)=</em></p>
<p>In F# <em>open System.IO</em>  is basically your C# <em>using System.IO</em></p>
<p>So C# can use F# classes and  F# classes can use C#. </p>
<p>What Makes F# interesting is that it can process lists in parallel with almost no effort. </p></div>

<p>The software will be split up into modules, and if some module has a bug in it because the database has a -1 value and the function expected 0....100, that module can then be disabled and the user can keep on working with the rest of the program. If the bug cause a complete crash and the user has to phone you then you don' find time anymore to fix the bug because you are at the phone all the time.</p>
<p>If that module can be disable or bypassed then you can find time to fix that bug correctly.</p></div>

<p>Next, ask if they’ve scoped out third-party libraries (i.e., plug-ins and APIs) that can be used off the rack, so the programming team isn’t reinventing the wheel on your dime. </p>

<p>I have heard this myth over and over again.  Taking things off the rack in a lot of cases creates does not guarantee good end result. Sometimes the 3rd party libraries causes more problems than if you would have built it yourself. </p>
<p>Sometimes you need to reinvent the wheel because none of the wheels are designed to fit your specific needs. </p>
<p>The choice to use 3rd party libraries or design it yourself all depends on the nature of the project and the quality of the developers. Now how do you know when to build it yourself or use 3rd party libraries, you look how your project proceeds. If the 3rd party library slows you down or it takes too long to find one that fits your need then reinvent the wheel.</p></div>

At one point you will blindly trust the green status not realizing that some idiot developer disabled part of the test code to make it green. </p>
<p>Also unit testing does not guarantee quality code. SCRUM and unit tests tend to create the worst code I have seen.Not in the beginning but after a couple of iterations and when you have way too many unit tests to keep working. The tendency is a quick fix.</p></div>

<p>I know I can't take person very seriously. Really, what can you possiblely being doing that you can avoid such basic structures as those?</p>

<p>I also never have used linked lists except in school. Of course the software libraries probably use it internally. 
And I have millions of code written myself in probably every domain possible.</p>
<p>What I have learned so far in developing good code is:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to understand the problem you want to solve. Deciding that you will use linked list is meaning less if you don't know what you are building.</li>
<li>You cannot understand the problem unless you have built big parts of the code the first time. Don't waste your time on design patterns, until you understand the problem.</li>
<li>Build with fault tolerance in mind. Sooner or later some Noob will make a fault and give your program corrupted data. You don't want to cripple the functionality of a stupid double entry enters your IDictionary.</li>
<li>Build with easy testing in mind. The code that is easy to test by testers is also easy to develop yourself. I have seen code with more loggings that real functional code. That code became unreadable because the log lines hid it.</li>
<li>Build with change in mind. Design your code in such a way that if management or the client changes their mind then it can be easily altered. That type of code is also more readable and easier to build.</li>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>But good developers don't expect others to fix their bugs. I mean if you start a project, at least do the effort to create quality code to the very end. You can't call yourself a good developer if you leave half developed mess around.</p>
<p>Also good developers create code for the none-nerd. It is designed for ease of use, not massive functionality that is half implemented. The interesting things is that when you develop for the none-nerd, you create way better code, because it is easier to use, easier to understand, easier to test and debug and way more compact. </p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The reason why this is a stupid idea is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subscription means DRM, DRM means a hole in the enterprise firewall.</li>
<li>Subscription means: <em>I am in deep trouble if my company digs out that project from 4 years ago and asks me to fix a tiny bug</em></li>
<li>Subscription means, developments tools failure if you are a Greek citizen that can't pay your taxes anymore. </li>
<li>Most developers in big companies actually have their personal license, because it takes years before the company decide to purchase it. A subscription is definitely not a good idea. Especially when you have a dead in the water project because they ran out of budget this year. In big companies it can take many months even years before you get a go to update to the newest one. Especially when your are in teams the size of 100+. Visual Studio 2010 is still massively used because of this. Code that could not be migrated because they depend on libraries of companies that do not exist anymore.</li>
<li>Jetbrains can go broke in a couple of years. Especially now that developers revolt and do not trust Jetbrains anymore. Your project is a sitting duck when they power off their DRM severs.</li>
<li>Subscription means that Jetbrains is not motived anymore to create new and exciting tools. They got your money, so they stop caring.</li>

<p>The left side stays staring on your face actually all the time distracting from the real content on the right. And on a Desktop monitor 75 cm from your nose the words Alex Booker IS HUGE, it draws all your attention.</p>
<p>I know it is a big hype to have such sites but the moment I see this then I immediately click away and don't bother to even read the text. For me it is like one of these screaming advertisements sites as click bait.</p>
<p>I did read the text and it is good but I have absolutely no clue why on Earth it is impossible to have a desktop version too.</p></div>

<p>I mean, come on, you are not going to learn C# on a tablet, but on a desktop computer with a big screen at 75 cm of your nose. 
That site should be optimized for desktop.  </p></div>

<p>Compilers at -O3 tend to produce very very efficient code as they're not bound by the limits of human sanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But only when it can. Do not blindly trust the -O3 generated assembler, you really must test it.</p>
<p>Sometimes reordering your function and variables can speed things up. E.g. something I have learned is that your function must be written in such a way that the code that is used most of the time is in front of the code that will rarely be called. You help the C compiler to avoid to have a jump in the code that should run most of the time. A jump in the assembler code stalls the execution because it has to reload a new cache. The optimizer can optimize the code that was written but not optimize for what is intended to do. </p>
<p><em>if x then A() else B()</em> could be slower than  <em>if (not x) then B() else A();</em></p>
<p>Sometimes to gain speed you could have the 2 versions, one optimized for A() and one optimized for B().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>note that C# compiles to a bytecode (Common Intermediate Language), not to machine code. CIL,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't let the IL code fool you, when you look how the IL code gets translated into real machine code (assembler) then it is very close.</p>
<p>Voat is not very friendly to write code examples, and I do not have lots of time to write code samples. I just hope that it triggers the love for assembly back and that people dare to look under the hood of what the C compiler creates. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I hope that I somehow make people curious and don't get scared of the assembler language. It is not that complicated and scarey at all. It is C that makes it appear more complicated and scarey. </p>
<p>Understand how the assembler is created by your C function or even C# function an you will create faster and more optimal code.</p></div>
