<p>No pre-planning no scheduling, no fixed deadline. Just a deadline around your next demo but give him wiggle room to delay a few days, no code review, no stand-up meeting. He builds from withing the code towards the desired result. </p>
<p>He will be far more productive when he is in &quot;the zone&quot; and can focus at the best problematically path to reach that end-goal that encompasses all user stories. He will focus on hard things when he feels good and only do boring stuff when he feels in no not so good day. And that can change by the hour. </p>
<p>He is going to use AGILE how it is mean to be, without the slowdown. </p>
<p>He is faster because he does not get slowed down with internal communications and endless debates and team meetings. He is faster because he does not have to also know the other unimportant things for the current goal he needs to have right now. He is also faster because he can test multiple results in one test, while the SCRUM equivalent would be every test for every user story.</p>
<p>The issue here is that not every developer will be this effective. And you must also trust that developer that the outcome will be a success. But when the developer has a track history of near zero bugs and lots of success rates then you must trust this knowledge. </p>
<p>Don't worry, at the end when the demo happens, you will still to test it the SCRUM way user story by user story. And you will still have the same unit tests and builds/deployments. Bit it will be highly optimized code, more reliable, less bugs and easier deployable. </p>
<p>But but but, how about transfer of knowledge?  That is a none issue since good developers can jump into any project, focus on it and they will be up and running in a very short time. </p></div>

<p>Explain to me, please, what are the restrictions of SCRUM that need bypassing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you were a developer you would not even ask such a question. The overhead 90% that SCRUM creates and prevents you from doing your job. You literally waste productivity by &quot;opening the road- put in the red cable, close the road. Open the road, put in the yellow cable, close the road. Open the Road, put in a green cable, close the road&quot;</p>
<p>I am going to repeat the challenge: Take one good developer let him do the exact same job as the complete SCRUM team and he will outpaced the SCRUM team, and produce better code. I am not asking you to believe me. Dare to do the test! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>SCRUM is a series of restrictions on how your product manager is permitted to interfere with you building great products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No! SCRUM causes so much overhead that it <strong>prevents</strong> great products to be developed. Your so called velocity is only an <strong>illusion number</strong> that makes you think that your are productive. That number is solving problems that is caused by SCRUM in the first place.</p>
<p>May I give you a clue what good developers can do? Good developer create code in such a way that they have absolutely no problem when a product manager comes in with last minute changes. </p></div>

<p>In addition it is also a big business for companies that cell these AGILE tools. You need to pay enormous amounts of money on tools that solves problems are caused by AGILE working.</p>
<p>With SCRUM you lose 100% productivity, but by buying these special tools you can increase your productivity to 10% again. At the same time with SCRUM your team works at 120%.</p>
<p>The madness in AGILE is that you need 8 people 2 weeks to do the exact same job as one good developer in 1-2 days. </p></div>

<p>Pragmatically, there is also much about the inefficiencies of object-orientation that workplace Marxism has come to love. The fact that object-oriented systems suffer a fundamental lack of modularity goes a long way to justify the collective code ownership.</p>

<p>This is wrong, you can perfectly use functional programming techniques within an OOP framework. That is what I do, I use best of both worlds to develop code that is almost bug free and reliable for years to come. </p>
<p>The reason why OOP seems to fail is because people use it wrong. The models are built the wrong way. They use it as some kind of glorified namespace and object layers that is only 1 dimension deep. </p></div>

<p>But what exactly are these skills? What does maintainable code exactly mean, that a software developer candidate needs to have expertise in? How can be a codebase’s resistance to change kept low, so that more and more features can be added without interruptions, and more and more developers can be hired to add new features even faster, and less and less full rewrites are needed, every couple of years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding more developers doesn't work, all you do is cripple the team even more. </p>
<p>I heard someone here as example that SCRUM is like climbing a tree and expect that when enough people climb trees that you will get to the Moon.</p>
<p>I also heard on a Youtube discussion that AGILE is like running a marathon by having your team gave 100 meter sprints every 1 week. That team never ends the marathon, they burn out or leave the company.</p>
<p>The only thing AGILE do is giving  the illusion that your team is productive but in reality they are wasting 90% of their productivity time on senseless meetings, planing, and creating spaghetti code that will fail the project.</p>
<p>To give an idea how deep the SCRUM madness gets: Imagine that you have 3 contractor workers that has to wire some building. </p>
<ul>
<li>Contractor A opens the road, puts in the cable and closes the road.  
</li>
<li>Contractor B has to wait until contractor A has closed the road before he can open the road put a cable in and close the road.</li>
<li>Contractor C has to wait until contractor B has closed the road before he can open the road put a cable in and close the road</li>
<li>Contractor A suddenly discovers at the demo that reds are red and it turns out that Contractor C has damaged the wires of Contractor A.</li>
<li>Contractor A has to reopen the road to emergency repair the wiring  and close the road again.</li>
<li>Contractor B now suddenly discovers that Contractors A emergency repairs now sens false sensory data to their wiring system.</li>
<li>Contractor B has to reopen the road, introduce some noise reduction filters and close the road again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the madness of wasting precious time and energy that could have been used for development instead.</p>
<p>One guy could have opened the road, put in all cables, cross checked of the cables are not damaged or interfere each other and only after he tested then he closes the road.</p>
<p>I challenge the companies to do this simple test. Take one good developer, and let him implement the same features as the complete scrum team. But no planning, no meetings, not predefined order no daily meetings, let him ficus on the work and stand back. That one guy replaces your complete SCRUM team and the end result will be better!</p></div>

<p>Moreover, there are actual methodologies that build on this idea of perpetual incremental improvement. Agile and lean methodologies require codebases that can manage and deal with change from day one, from the first line of code. That are written for change.</p>

<p>They suck at change! Agile has become a mega big industry of certificates where scrum teachers gets rich by promising companies eternal wealth by firing half of their developers and replace the other developers by low wage developers.</p>
<p>There is nothing Agile in Agile development, been in and out of Agile development and the development speed and development quality really sucks. </p>
<p>And the sad thing of all, you create a generation of developers that does not know that all their projects can be done faster, easier and cheaper. being brainwashed that AGILE is the only way, but it is not. It is the stupidest way, based on religious believe that AGILE is the lord and savior!</p></div>

How many times I have heard: &quot;We are going to rewrite it from scratch, but this time good....&quot; and then fail yet again.</p>
<p>The key to good development is to choose what you want to do and then bend the code around it. Never bend the solution around the technology because some design pattern can't handle it! Say fuck you to the design pattern and solve the issue. It will freak out the code monkeys but who cares? Your product matters. the end-user matters, the support team matters.</p></div>

<p>If you are a seasoned developer. I mean a developer with tons of experience and a stream of successful projects then you realize that what this guy is saying, is that you use up 90% of your development resources on something that never was a problem in the first place.</p>
<p>Your projects becomes so complex with additional crap for these unit tests on all levels that no understand the code anymore. They just change something and pray that it turns green. If it turn red then they are going to wiggle something hoping that this time it turns green.  When it is green then they assume that it is not going to wipe out civilization by some yet unseen bug.</p>
<p>The only things these green unit tests does is is make the manager happy by showing that it is all green. If these manager would realize what is below that shiny green light I think they will live in terror.</p>
<p>There is nothing AGILE in the AGILE process, just a a placebo to find excuse why your projects development are so slow and keeps on failing.</p></div>

So when you get rid of the only people that can Tapdance around your complete team and still end up delivering a working project then no one can call these people out anymore that they are doing it all wrong.</p>
<p>Right now I see this process happening at a client where I work. The good developers already started to jump ship, I am probably next. The last thing you want to be associated with is a project that will end in massive failure. Very bad for your resumé.</p></div>

<p>Be creative and design your own design pattern based on what you need to make. And this is very important in a game. Using design patterns makes you game exactly as bad as the competition. However if you use your creative mind, you will create a mechanism that will outperform the competition and do things they can't.</p>
<p>Just look at the current state of the games. They have flashy graphics but are completely worthless. They are just the exact same clones as the competition with the only difference of the background scenery. </p></div>

<p>More important don't use an app, but create scripts that can be copied and pasted by people without having to download source code. Everybody can have Python, and is harder to track a script.
Even better would be distribute the scripts through message boards so there is no single point of entry that can be tracked. If you have it on github then the government can look who downloaded it.</p></div>

<p>I have noticed recently that the Internet is forgetting who I am. Up until a few years ago &quot;the Internet never forgets&quot;. However with all these privacy tracking, telemetry data, the big companies gets so overwhelmed that they have to filter the data and interestingly enough all the data I find on myself are outdated, wrong and unusable. Even though my name is still out there it gets corrupted with data that they try to complete but is completely wrong.</p>
<p>The added bonus is that big data is so vast that big companies can't even verify anymore if their data is actually valid or pure corrupted and fakes.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I think it all depends on the region. But also realize if something is popular, it also means that you have tons of competition that are probably cheaper than you.</p>
<p>What I do is I learn the mainstream enough to know what it is all about and to pass a HR selection. The moment that I need to apply for the job I already have a head start and can focus to learn it fast prior for the interview.</p>
<p>The key in becoming a good developer is that you can adapt fast. never that you excel in one framework or language. Learn to make your brain placid enough to quickly to unlearn things and relearn something new in a week or a month. C++ took me a month to get used to the rest normally one week or so.</p></div>

Look around you many applications have been deteriorated in pure crappy and ergonomics disastrous applications.</p>
<p>And no you don't have to rewrite the application  from scratch. Just stop forcing your best developers follow this AGILE methodology and let them do their jobs. They will speed up 10 times. When I look at what I develop, what I normally do as one is now a complete team of 8 people. The team of 8 could have developed  10-80 times more but you cripple them with this stupid AGILE methodology.</p></div>

<p>On top of that software developing is always disappointing because you work very hard and no one understands what you do. And one of the weird things is that code that looks elegant and easy to understand is actually the hardest to create. Managers don't get impressed if these 100 readable lines is all you did in the last week.

<p>One would think so but I have met a lot of developers that have an ego the size of a planet. And somehow these people befriends the managers and they stay in the company for many years.</p>
<p>It is amazing how managers gets so easily fooled by these big ego and victim blaming developers. I have always wondered why, but I think these managers lack technical knowledge and don't want to admit that they don't know what you are talking about. So they lock onto the guy that acts the most cool.</p></div>

<p>Sadly enough I also have witnessed this with males. Sometimes you wonder wtf is wrong with the managers for keeping them. The answer is mostly because he is such a social good guy.</p>
<p>Also the victim playing, I have seen many males play the victim card why again their projects refuse to work. They always blame it on something else, like the wrong Windows service pack installed, the wrong version of the OS, the wrong firmware on that notebook, the wrong version of Flash installed. Must be 13.0.1.6532 and you installed 13.0.1.6522..... And fro some strange reason managers keep these idiots destroying every project they get in their hands for years. </p></div>

<p>Because you want to ensure that you always pass the majority of tests, you tend to think about this when you change and extend the program. You therefore are more reluctant to make large-scale changes that will lead to the failure of lots of tests. Psychologically, you become conservative to avoid breaking lots of tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I see this happening in AGILE teams. Teams dead scared to change anything because they risk that they fail the sprint. And good developers are held back to change too much because it might break something. So months later the software is in a worse crap than before.</p>
<p>The failure in unit testing as the SCRUM is relying on is, that you get a false sense of security/ Below the hood you may have 2 errors compensating each other and you don't realize it. Developers never do any effort to understand the code what is behind the tests. They just blindly assume that the test works perfectly and is to be trusted. However to get to the sprint deadline developers could disable the unit test, they will fix it after the demo. But they forget.</p>
<p>The idea of TDD is modeled on good developers as AGILE, however it gets abstracted to the extreme in such a way that even the developers they modeled it on will fail. Good developer invent new wheels and design patterns depending on their needs. They say f*ck you to imposed design patterns and design rules. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I always avoid recursion at any cost. Most of the time you can rewrite the code without recursion. </p>
<p>Recursion is hiding the code constructs and is incredibly hard to debug. You may understand it at this moment, but as your program ages, languages change, syntax change, it is going to kick your ass big. </p>
<p>My advice: avoid them.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>AGILE/SCRUM is not the way, it causes results that is rotten to the core with a shiny surface.</p>
<p>Secure software must be designed from bit one. And it takes time to get good results and takes masters. And you can't rush masterworks it takes time to age. </p>
<p>Also good software is better developed with a small team that gets the focus without a rush to get that sprint deadline. The obsession to focus on user stories alone, prevents good developers to change the underlying structure when they discover a design flaw. Let them do their job and trust what they produce. </p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Full stack developers tend to produce bad quality end-results. I could be regarded as some full stack developer because I can jump on any level you throw at me, but when I become good at one thing I lose experience at the others. </p>
<p>It is wrong to assume that when you understand 7 levels that you become 7x times better. In reality you become 1/7th better because you are just one person. It will actually become 1/10th because of the overhead.</p>
<p>Being full-stack also comes at a cost. Your s a developer doesn't have good experience at any level. You become just average just like all other code monkeys. There is no pride anymore in the work that you created because another code monkey  will probably destroy the quality and replace it with a broken system. So you stop caring about the code you produce and the quality goes down. Projects fail.</p>
<p>Code monkeys can appear good for a company since they are cheaper than experienced developers and can be easily thrown away and replaced. But the cost savings are short lived since it guarantees you that 6 months later 100% of all your projects will fail. Low cost code monkeys and no productive end-results.</p></div>

Oner trick to speed up searching for information was to split up data into 26 different files. Each one for a starting character you wanted to store and search back. Mostly the first letter of the last name.</p>
<p>Those files were text files so in case there was a software bug we could easily correct them by hand. </p></div>

<ul>
<li>Writing good code: Your focus is on perfect code but your application will ergonomically suck and be a disaster to use. Look at Sharepoint, Sales Force, SAP. </li>
<li>Writing the right code: Your focus is to develop your code for the product you want to develop. Your main focus is to give the user the best user experience, the best work flow, but your code will deviate from coding and patterns. Your code <strong>must</strong> deviate from best practices and patterns because it must be optimized for the project you need to create. Oddly enough this always results i a very compact elegant code that is incredibly easy to read and modify.  </li>

<blockquote>
<p>SCRUM master</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wooo, that may explain it. You have been brainwashed into developing a bad coding habit that will end up with 100% failed projects.</p>
<p>You paid a lot of money to snakes oil sellers: &quot;Do these steps and you will become the best developer of the world&quot;. Sad reality is that you have been trained in quackery and bad coding habits. And you will never be able to unclear these bad coding habits. You became a code monkey, lost any creativity to bring software projects home and successfully.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough everybody is now following for SCRUM master and it does not add anything of value to your resume now. You are just a cog like the other 1000 cogs in the wheel. As a developer you don't have unique qualities that the others does not have. There is no reason to hire you because they have choice of 1000 other developers that knows the exact same thing as you.</p>
<p>Now how do you get out of there? Kick the SCRUM methodology out, it only slows you down. Learn something others don't know. Take something that has a higher learning curve and challenges your creativity. Don't become the slave of frameworks, take control become the master of your own framework.</p>
<p>I had unique chances to work inside SCRUM teams and outside, work in enterprise environments and in small companies. SCRUM cripples my productivity to about 10%. Enterprise environment between 30-50% depending on the team leader. Small company I work 120% productivity.</p></div>

<p>You can use Nim for quick and dirty projects but the time you invest in that Nim project could have been used to create a C++ framework from day 1. There is a big different if you generate C code or if you write C code. If you generate C code it gets ugly pretty fast.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>It’s well known that creative people lose their creativity if asked to explain themselves while they are working.</strong> It’s the same with software. Programmers often have to work in an environment of one-sided transparency. These Agile systems, so often misapplied, demand that they provide humiliating visibility into their time and work, despite a lack of reciprocity. Instead of working on actual, long-term projects that a person could get excited about, they’re relegated to working on atomized, feature-level “user stories” and often disallowed to work on improvements that can’t be related to short-term, immediate business needs (often delivered from on-high). <strong>This misguided but common variant of Agile eliminates the concept of ownership and treats programmers as interchangeable, commoditized components.</strong></p>
<p>Scrum is the worst, with its silliness around two-week “iterations”. It induces needless anxiety about microfluctuations in one’s own productivity. <strong>There’s absolutely no evidence that any of this snake oil actually makes things get done quicker or better in the long run. It just makes people nervous.</strong> There are many in business who think that this is a good thing because they’ll “work faster”. I’ve been in software for ten years, as a manager and a worker bee. It isn’t true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SCRUM is the destroyer of teams and the destroyer of projects. Once in a while one team succeeds but it is not because of the SCRUM but because the developers in that team use pure willpower against the SCRUM that does anything to sabotage them. Without the SCRUM anchor these developer would probably produce 4-5 times more quality because they are not held back.</p>
<p>Successful developers don't suddenly pops up a magical solution out of their hats. They solve things quickly because years ahead that have been experimenting with solutions that in the future will be needed. They are already ahead of the curve and anytime they have a free moment the develop tools that come handy when a crisis occurs.</p>
<p>SCRUM prevents these good developers to think ahead and create solutions before they are needed. So this SCRUM is a temporary speedup until the developers en counter a new issue that they did not have a solution before. Your project dies now because you wrongly assume that your developers are bad.</p></div>

It always makes the guy that is less developed feel dumb and ends up in depression.

<p>The main goal of continuous integration is to identify the problems that may occur during the development process earlier and more easily. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No it is not. It causes more problems and wasts developers time on stupid unit tests. </p>
<p>The reason is very simple, you create lazy developers that just do something until the code gets green again. And worse of all it makes your projects suck in the end. You have code rot and you don't realize until the project is dead.</p>
<p>Continuous integration explodes the number of developers it need to develop and with more developers you need team leaders and then managers for these team leaders.... Then expensive build servers then expensive automated unit tests. </p>
<p>I see the results of these Continuous integrations all the times. The green status LED means absolute nothing. Under that green LED status you have design flaws that no one questions. You are creating a project that is destined to fail because no one questions if that code is doing what it is supposed to do. </p></div>
