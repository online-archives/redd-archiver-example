    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>You don't need to be smart for coding, just the willpower to nail that solution and become better than the average. </p>
<p>Most modern day programmers really suck at programming. They are so hyped up in design patterns that they have no clue that they really suck at programming. Also stay way from this SCRUM madness. Follow this and you will end up with the most fucked up program ever recorded in human history.  The world needs good developers that have a very creative mindset, can create technology out of thin air, to nail the ergonomic design. </p>
<p>This world has lost the ability to reinvent the wheel, the current wheel developers are reusing has become complete rubbish. Big giant monoliths pretending to be small nuget packages. Nowadays you can't even create a &quot;Hello world&quot; program without sucking own 12.154 dependencies.</p>
<p>Teamwork, good projects suck when teamwork is involved. When teamwork is involved your project becomes the worst developer in the team. All you end up is with a team of lazy developers. </p>
<p>Best teams do not work as team. Best developers are competitive, they don't teach each others ways; best developers look at what the others have done and absorb what is better and reject what is worse. I become better than my team members because I want to be better. The other team members are now forced to up their skills to become better than me. In the end your complete team becomes way better than other teams because now you develop according to your best programmers. And you keep on staying in this team because they are worthy my level because they challenge me to become even better.</p>
<p>My key is, follow the masses in development and you become obsolete in a few years. Don't follow the masses and you will outperform all these other developers that will burn out and everyone will want you.</p></div>

<p>The key is to start with something, and as you find typical jobs you then tend to focus on the skills to pass the job interview.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/3005648#16785502">Should journalists learn how to code? It can&#39;t hurt.</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>That is not how programming works. </p>
<p>1000 of typing monkeys does not create a good book.
Neither will 1000 scrum developers create one useful product.</p>
<p>The annoying thing about AI is that you have to teach what you want. 
So instead of programming you have to train it by telling what it should do. 
Imagine guiding 1000 typing monkeys to write a good book, they won't listen to you.</p>
<p>The other issue with AI is that AI can only create what it learned to create.
It becomes an less than average developer creating sub standard solutions.</p>
<p>Out in the real world with the #learntocode madness and scrum we have 100 out of 1 developers that are pure crap.
Good developers gets outnumbers by 100 bad developers that undo their programming.
Interesting is when a company is downsizing and fires most developer, the good developers suddenly becomes productive again.</p>
<p>AI assisting developers to create good programs faster is another ballgame.
A good developer can focus on what he wants to build and the AI is a glorified spell checker. </p>
<p>AI does not benefit in generating programs. We already have thousands of skins available for code that are exactly clones of each other.
There is nothing new the AI can create it already exists.</p>
<p>But a good developer can out of the blue invent new technology to create things that does not yet exist optimized for your company.
Good programmers can escape the box of limitations and create something new. I call it cheating because they bypass coding rules.</p>
<p>In addition when AI is thought wrong, it gets harder to get it back on track.</p>
<p>And yes I have been learning everything about AI the last 3 years to have a feeling what it is able to do.<br />
It is still really disappointing, and takes good developers to guide it to become somehow practical.</p></div>

<p>Without scrum, when we discover issues, or even finds new bugs in the code we can fix them instantly without having to go through an enormous waste of time through the sprints. 
With scrum we were forced to put a feature to done even buggy. Without scrum we put a feature done when it is ready and the quality is met.</p></div>

<p>That 15 minute standup meeting is not scrum, that is only 1% of scrum. </p>
<p>And after 2 years all those in favor of scrum have left the projects. We finally have now the time to fix the crap and make it function in record time. Those user stories that is inefficient crap. Three weeks of sprint, and no way to respond fast and fix the thing that took ages. Without the scrum, ask us anything and within half a day or 2 days it is in. That is agile development, not that slow paced scrum sprint.</p>
<p>In the next weeks the very efficient functioning of our team that are now free from scrum will create shock-waves. More production, less bugs, faster development, better improvements, performant code. That is what you get when you use your developers at their peak capacity instead of this crappy use story related that cripples your developers and make them feel unhappy.</p>
<p>We are not restricted to the project manager anymore, we are faster than any project manager.</p></div>

<p>Two years I worked in a team where you need 10 people to do exactly the same thing as one developer that does not use scrum. Thanks god they finally realized that it sucked and now we are back in the none-scrum mode and projects suddenly flourish without stress.</p>
<p>Scrum only benefits bad programmers into thinking that they are good. Scrum is like paint by numbers and then think that you created a Michelangelo.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/3005648#16471651">Should journalists learn how to code? It can&#39;t hurt.</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The annoying thing with coding is that it is a 365.2422/7/24 none stop effort. You eat behind the PC, you drink behind the PC you even take your laptop to the toilet.  Blink and a 18 year old replaces your job because he is ahead of you. </p>
<p>The other thing is that 18 year old that just replaced you will be replaced 6 months or 1 year from now because he too becomes obsolete. So the world is creating one giant pile of throwaway developers that will end up in a burn out state and jump from a building.</p>
<p>Now the good news: Those developers that are on top of the food-chain and evolved while other developers gave up or jumped from a building will be the ones that companies need after they burned through the complete population. Those will become the new millionaires.</p></div>

They have been brainwashed &quot;how to think&quot; and create crappy projects, they never learned to think for themselves and invent new ways to nail down your project.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that they are not even aware how badly they suck. The proof will be in the pudding because 5 years down the road they  will lose their job as a developer because they are still stuck to the ways they were brainwashed. It is almost impossible to unlearn your bad behavior in software.</p>
<p>Modern developers have lost the ability to think in multiple dimensions. All they have learned is paint by numbers and one dimensional thinking.</p></div>

<p>AGILE:</p>

<li>Open the road, put a cable in it, damage the other cable, close the road. Log a bug for next sprint</li>
</ul>
<p>Super AGILE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the road, put in cable 1, 2, 3, fix the broken cable A, close the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>AGILE: </p>
<ul>
<li>Open the road, lose focus because of the stand up meeting, lose an hour to discover that the commits of the developers broke your previous commit, debate  2 hours, close the road.</li>
</ul>
<p>Super AGILE:</p>
<ul>
<li>You work alone, no other idiot broke your code, no meetings to lose your focus, you plan ahead  and prepare your code for fast changes, you take in the toughest job when you feel 150% capacity and you do boring jobs after a night out with the friends. You have higher quality of code because you realize that no one of the other developers will fix your bug so it will get thrown back in your face next time. </li>
</ul>
<p>90% of the so called AGILE is bureaucracy and holding you back to develop fast as an experienced developer that can tackle multiple projects at the same time.  
</p>
<p>You can easily verify my claim, take a developer that started in the 1990's and did not yet get brainwashed with this AGILE madness. Ask him to do the same thing as your complete SCRUM group would. In 2-3 sprints he will bypass your complete team because he does not get the management overhead of the SCRUM team.</p></div>

<p>We nowadays have a complete generation of developers that have no clue what good code is. They grew up with buggy, unresponsive code so they. think that this is normal. They are completely unaware that it can be done, very stable, ultra fast, zero bugs and deploy within an hour. </p>
<p>I keep on telling them that if they want it, I can fix it. They look at you not even understanding a word what I have said. They think I brag but then I do it.</p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>My brain. I used to use modelling software back around 1999 but they all failed to meet the need. Modelling tools and even these stupid &quot;Design patterns&quot; are a limit to your creativity to build great software.</p>
<p>Modern modelling tools are even worse nowadays than back on the old days.</p>
<p>You have to know that they claim that these &quot;Designer patterns&quot; and modelling tools are based on the best developers techniques. It is complete marketing BS because these &quot;Design patterns&quot; are only the crystallized  creative end-result of the best developers. It is only a shadow of what makes these best developer good: Their creativity to invent new stuff out of scratch to solve the problem. By using these &quot;design patterns&quot; and &quot;modelling tools&quot; your brain gets frozen in a static way never to recover.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><blockquote>
<p>I want to see progress. I want change. I want state-of-the-art in software engineering to improve, not just stand still. I don’t want to reinvent the same stuff over and over, less performant and more bloated each time. I want something to believe in, a worthy end goal, a future better than what we have today, and I want a community of engineers who share that vision.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not alone, I am daily fighting the the goal to make programming great again. </p>
<p>I hate this SCRUM! I hate it because developers that like it becomes losers. People that used to be good developers became stuck in the losers mindset and nowadays they even don't bother to ship something that is good. It is frustrating to have a struggle to make good software because in their losers mindset they are pre-programmed that it can't be done. Their mindset is stuck to this silly believe that you need a complete SCRUM team to do the job of one good developer.</p>
<p>However not everything is doom and gloom. The best developers have already moved on to a world where there is a steeper learning curve: Building their own hardware from scratch. Design PCB's, solder the electronics, build their hardware, program their hardware, build their own hardware tools like 3D printers and laser cutters. The bad developers can't reach that level anymore. </p>
<p>I do think that kernel developers in Linux, now that Linux has turned full SJW with their stupid CoC, will find new ground away from these forced social PC. These kernel developers probably will start to create their own hardware. </p>
<p>I never understood why developers have this stupid need to work together to build a giant project together where complete idiots can destroy your code and you are called a bully. Working together means that you are a beta. real developers take charge and becomes the alpha.</p></div>

<p>I actually learned this multiple code paths exploration back then when I needed to develop software for massive amounts of data processing in as short of time with limited hardware. I created multiple different solutions and measured the speed. The most effective one got continued and the rest removed. </p>
<p>Doing this will temporary create a more complex solutions but the complexity will be cleaned up and in the end you will have a deceivingly simple and effective code. But it can be done only when one developer modifies this part, without interfering by others.</p>
<p>Nowadays, my aim is not for speed but in ways where testing becomes way simpler, and once deployed the user does not get blocked when a bug shows up. The code will become more complex but the log files will be more readable for none-developers.</p></div>

<p>I see deterioration of many teams in my company because they choose the lazy ways and the business value only. It is only short term thinking quick and easy gain. The standards are getting lower and lower but they don't realize it and neither the managers. The reason is because they play it safe, small incremental changes too afraid to change something dramatic because the code sucks. </p>
<p>Why don't I develop because it has business value? Because that way I will explore new code paths and solutions that does not have immediate quick values. </p>
<p>Why will I not be lazy? Because I will go off the safe path to explore different paths and may find news solutions that are more compact in code, more elegant and way easier to deploy. </p>
<p>Why don't I work in pair? Because it always end up onto debate, debate debate and pointless discussions because the other developer lacks the coding skills to see what I am doing.</p></div>

<p>It’s very simple: if you can not do work and still gain the same value as you would doing it, then don’t do the work.</p>

<p>I don't like this sentence. That word &quot;Value&quot;. This stupid word is used all over AGILE/SCRUM but cause more problems that it fixes. 
This very word &quot;Value&quot; as in &quot;Business Value&quot; is the primary cause why you now need 10 more people to do the exact same thing as developers could single handed 5 years ago.</p>
<p>Modern software developers are scared to change code, they keep on playing it all safe. Only small incremental changes are allowed otherwise it is a big no-no. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't gable with the code or take any risks. I aim for maximum productive results with zero bugs.</p></div>

<p>If you can’t quite manage that, I’d advise you to take on less work in each time period, until you’ve taken on a small enough batch that you can actually get it done. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Massive FAIL! This never works in good programming. </p>
<p>In good programming you look at all the possible issues and then create a multiple dimensional level solution that solves it elegantly. The code will be a little bit more complex but it probably collapse the number of code to 20% of what you would have created. </p>
<p>And if done correctly, this slightly more complex code will be self correcting and self testing where your need for mocking and unit testing will be reduced to the minimum. </p>
<p>Good developers don't write code, they write cathedrals where every part has a function and well thought place.</p></div>

<p>Jesus, quit the &quot;principles&quot; reasoning!</p>
<p>The best developers don't follow principles, they create principles based on what they need. They don't follow patterns, they invent patterns for what they need. And what is needed depends on the company's needs. </p>
<p>Get rid of these SCRUM teams and you will notice that one good developer will replace one complete SCRUM team when they are allowed to do their work. Take developers that started their careers in the 90's. the period where good developers came into existence because  they self-learned it all by themselves.</p></div>

<p>I’ve tried to help those people understand that their organization is doing “Agile” wrong: they’re not doing what the Manifesto authors recommended, what Scrum recommends, what the many Agile Software Development experts recommend. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>WRONG! SCRUM sucks also Agile Software Development experts suck even, bigger!</p>
<p>Claiming that they are doing it all wrong, is a clear indication that you have no clue what programming is. The big giant flaw in by these co called Agile software developers is that they try to &quot;quantify&quot; software development and assume that software development is team work and can be teached.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great software is ready when it is ready, not when time is up.</li>
<li>Great software cannot be planned and predicted before, you create a fuzzy goal and ask the developers to create something that does this.</li>
<li>Great software developers work efficiently alone. They need to build their code reliably and that does not work when you get some idiot crippling all your code at random locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now brace for impact, anyone that was brainwashed into SCRUM methodology, your life will suck because it is going to take many years to unlearn these bad behaviors. If you came from school and did not develop 5 years ago, then your brain was never trained to be creative and your career is over.</p></div>

<p>The article is correct about the Ukrainians. I know some of them. </p>
<p>Western Europeans are degrading in quality. The reason is the SCRUM, we feel unchallenged and our jobs are as exciting as the script kiddies jobs. Two years down the road and we have not done anything productive, just meetings, meetings, demos and more meetings. But I keep my knowledge sharp by doing projects at  home :-) Many already left for better places, I think by the end of the year the only people they will have left are N00Bs that just entered the programming field. Have mercy on their souls!</p></div>

<p>But you don't have to believe me. Programming as a profession sucks the life out of you if you are not built for it.</p></div>

What is not visible at the developers side is that developers gets replaced by newer ones fresh from school that were not yet spoiled with technology that is 1 year old. You have done so much effort to learn to code and then after your 5 minutes of fame (about 1 year) no one wants you anymore. </p>
<p>I understand your reasoning but the hard reality of the coding world is completely different.</p></div>

The rate the technology is changing is every 3-4 weeks nowedays. If you don't follow a certification every 3 weeks then you get outperformed in maybe 9 weeks.</p>
<p>Currently there is a rat race to the bottom and we are burning up new developers at a fast pace. Those that manage to stay being a developer have evolved that way by keeping up to date 24/7/365 for decades. </p>
<p>It gets even worse, the code you learn nowadays will be stuck into your brain. In order to keep up to date you must have the capability to unlearn what you have learned before and relearn something new. </p>
<p>Most of the developers that enter the developers field will become burger flippers in a few years from now.</p></div>

<p>It is like losing your language ability because in 3 years from now they jumped from English then Chinese then Arabic then Spanish then Chiniglisch.... And modern days they mix languages and coding styles withing the same application.</p>
<p>If you don't have a natural tendency to figure it out all by yourself, then your career of being a developer ends after merely 3 years.</p>
<p>Good developers are not formed by educating them, good developers will automatically learn everything without ever being taught! All developers that does not have this natural instinct to self-teach and explore uncharted territories will be wiped from the work force in about 5 years.</p>
<p>Look at the speed they bring out changes in languages and technologies. Even the ones that were excited one year ago are now being burned up.</p></div>
