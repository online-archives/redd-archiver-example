    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">When you're a non partisan, you can see both sides and the damage done by people like the_dipshits and the left SJWs, but acting like the_donald didn't commit rule breaking because every single subreddit wasn't scrutinized for rule breaking or monitored as heavily as the_donald was, is flawed thinking because the_donald IS VERY POPULAR. While some subreddits that were actively promoting hate or rule breaking weren't "cracked down on" like The_donald has been at times... * they weren't as popular by a far margin* and Reddit's admins have tried to clean up "rule breaking" and things that would leave Reddit in a potential legal situation like displaying personal information... Hence the removal of subreddits like FPH. While behavior like this used to be more common on the_donald, it has since slowed down... Although not complete stopped, which is why plenty of people have pushed for the removal of the subreddit. In return, instead of removing the very popular subreddit, that draws plenty of attention to the site, it seems like Reddit has decided to do some moderations... Like what we've seen. 

My point is there is extreme potential for a popular subreddit like that, and although most people there do engaging in some trolling, I don't expect many to follow through with threats, but with it being so popular Reddit hopes the example set by the moderation team isn't something that incites something that could effect Reddit in either a legal way or to the detriment of Reddit's value/popularity. 
For example, let's say some crazy person decided to do something against liberals like hold up a pizza joint with a rifle because he had been reading "over and over again" on Reddit that this place was a chomo hub. Well, Reddit could be liable. 

It's both damage done in a legal ramifications type-of-way, but also it was tolerant of the narrative that led that.  Another example, let's say a doctor's name was brought up and his phone number put on display... Then someone started threatening him. Well... He could make a good case against Reddit. 


Anyways, if you wanted to see a real reason for Reddit to delete a comment. ☝🏻️☝🏻☝🏻



Edit: ~~just got banned from this sub, comment about to be removed.~~



Also, to the people that are like *youre a partisan shill.* 

Even if that were true, which it's not... That still doesn't make my points wrong.


I can be non partisan and also call tump troll douchebags online, it's like you don't understand that trump supporters are literally the world's biggest band of conspiracy theorists and trolls pushing narratives. But hey, I'm sure that doesn't go straight over your head... But even if I was a hillaryLover... I'm not, never was.... IM A non voting non partisan and a skeptical critic. That's always been my POV and MO.  IMO every president/candidate is deserving of their own fair share of criticism. Hilary, Bernie, Obama, by Bill Clinton and Bush all needed to be scrutinized and all future candidates do too. 

My thoughts about Russia are that none of us really know, but it is understandable why both sides feel the way they do and I can understand that and explain it in the real world. But actin like a band triggered trump trolls aren't getting in the way of my life isn't quite true to reality. 

If I like Starbucks, trump trolls call you names. 

If you get on reddit, trump trolls spam the front page. 

If you're Native American and you're getting a pipeline in your backyard, you'll be called a "pussy. "




Liberated cuck snowflake. 


I'd rather know I'm going to be critical of everyone rather than loyal to any one of these LIARS.  And you sir, are looking for a confirmation bias to confirm trump's greatness/innocence instead of waiting to know the facts.  Kinda like Tell me the truth, but only if it's some I like. </div>
