    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Don't apologise for snark. I often get people unintentionally offside for my level of snark. I'm a naturally sarcastic and irreverent person. 

So, my atheism is unique in that I used to be a devote Mormon and then dug around a bit and discovered I had been lied to for the majority of my life.  Not only did that shake my belief system, it burnt a lot of faith based and bible based beliefs right out of me. 

Major bug bear is being guided by your feelings to determine if something is true. Talk about the definition of confirmation bias!

So now I'm science and ethics based.  I come to a lot of conclusions that religious friends come to when presented with new information. However, I don't fall into the trap of rationalising certain behaviours with the belief that God will sort it out.  (FFS Trump is not chosen by God to lead America back into the golden age) That can be a boon and a hinderance. Sometimes it would be nice to think there was a cosmic space wizard looking out for me. Evidence simply says that is not the case. 

As for Islam. One stray click will forever shift your view that in the truly fundamental societies, they will forever be at odds with our core values.  I was scrolling through T_D (I like to try and see different perspectives, no matter how obscure or bizarre) and I clicked on a state sanctioned beheading.  I think it's possible to get mild PTSD from watching shit on the internet. 

I'm sure your friends mean well, but they likely lack perspective.  If I were them?  I wouldn't be rushing out to get hardcore perspective anytime soon. Shit'll give you nightmares. </div>

I think it's got barbarous people who insight violence, just like most 'The One and Only Truth' religions.

Aside from the constant apologising (must get rather annoying), sounds like you're surrounded by fun people.  Maybe you'll learn more about what makes them think and feel the way they do. </div>

Edit: went on Voat.co (assuming that's the website you refer to) and it's basically a safe space for T_D. Dissenting views get shouted down. You're not 'allowed' to share sources from what is deemed illegitimate sources. 

Completely biased... a lot like.... r/politics?</div>

Not sure how you equate Clinton's email to Flynn acting as a foreign agent, Trump now firing 3 officials directly related to investigating him, and the suspicion of money laundering via real estate purchases. 

If he were innocent, wouldn't he be crying out for a special investigator?  

He's done some crazy shit, but this latest move is insane. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Actually agree with that. Though, you keep mentioning how T_D was bad BEFORE the election, which implies it's not a cesspool of angry pitchforks now. 

In other news, James fucking Comey just got sacked on the same day grand jury subpoenas were issued about the Russia investigation. 

Whatever your beliefs, we are in the midst of the most uncertain and frankly alarming crisis in American politics.  

Not really worried about your bad grammar anymore.

You have valid points on many of your issues. I am more than willing to discuss those issues with you. 

But then you end your rant about how bias this site is by calling me mean names and doing your best to hurt my fragile feelings.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">By all means, I am happy to have a meaningful discussion.  We'd first have to establish what our mutual understanding of meaningful is. 

For example, have been watching Trump like a hawk and find him to be a bumbling mess up to this point.  I have little faith that he can turn things around, but I have to literally force myself to be objective due to the confirmation bias. 

Happy to parse it down by issues.  Should we start with healthcare?

Edit: also, I love neural politics. When something complex needs parsing, I visit there and get straight forward unbiased information. 

The interesting thing about partisan politics is I'm never going to suddenly swing to the right, just as you won't swing left.  Nor should we be expected to. However, I can be wrong in my view on a specific matter and it's important to recognise this possibility and change my opinion as better information comes to light. </div>

TL;DR

Christians are spineless pacifists. 
Muslims are murderous fanatics. 

Breaking out the big brushes, are we?  </div>

It's so nice to go there and have meaningful conversation without being called a cuck, libtard, asshole, or somehow have my patriotism come into question because I don't fall to my knees in front of KingDonnie, like the rest of the sub.  I'm glad they have open and free discourse without resorting to brigading dissenting views and banning people. 

The subs you mentioned are nearly identical to each other and give credence to the nutty horseshoe theory. </div>

My comment was mostly jest, but we happen to agree on a lot of things. Have never been more involved in global politics since Trump announced he'd be running. 

Anyway, will read and respond in a few hours. 

Edit:  just glanced at the last bit and saw you called me an immature asshole, so can't imagine my response is going to be much more than a 'fuck you.'</div>

Atheism applies to all religions because atheists don't believe in God. 

My assumption would be American Atheists 'shit on' Christianity more because of familiarity over anything else. 

You're not going to find too many atheists giving Islam a pass. </div>
