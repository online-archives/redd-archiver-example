    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I dont think it would be focused on any one group of people aside from new people, though social scores in general are a worrying concept, could you share which reddit you found the minimum requirements in?

I was worried just the other day of karma and then just thankful I didnt live in China where such a thing matters, I wonder if Reddit plans to protest the Chinese at all, they seem to be trying to get along with them at the moment, a lot of things they are involved in that should draw legitimate worry, though not trying to take this post too far off your topic, social scores just scare me.</div>

Could have thought up a better team name.  wasn't it a big thing back in the 20s to be anti communist in America? it does sound like you were trying to start a movement? An interesting topic, the individual rights a person has to do just that, much like their team name, you should consider starting a more peaceful movement, the world really does need less vitriol, they may let you if you are a bit more tactful and mindful of what is highlighted, you have good intentions I feel, maybe try to parse your emotions on the matter and take them into further consideration, develop your idea and intentions more. my best.</div>
