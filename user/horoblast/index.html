    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It was upvoted 5 times in a matter of minutes and someone commented on it positively. It's the MODS, not the "people" who disapproved. If you're trying to defend yourself with "muh people", then it should've stayed up and downvoted to hell. That's how it works. Also again, just shadowbanned for posting in another sub, isn't that against reddit overall policy &amp; rules? Also no notification, I asking the mods &amp; no answer, ever. It's simple, they don't care, they're power tripping, they're purging all "dissenting" opinions rather than letting their own users upvote &amp; downvote what they want and they deliberately ignore you when you respectfully ask for an explanation.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah... I got banned from /r/Belgium yesterday, there was a thread about Trump coming to Belgium/Europe and more people than usual were fed up with the fake protests and shit, fake outrage all the time about people who only listen to the news etc. I made a joke about free helicopter rides and got permabanned by JebusGobson who's friends &amp; another mod with people who make "jokes"/jokes like this : http://i.magaimg.net/img/mde.png . Idk if they're serious even or a joke but ... helicopter jokes = bad, advocating white genocide = okay ... Either all jokes go, or none. *sigh*. Is DEUS VULT now also advocating mass genocide to muslims and retaking Jerusalem from the muslims/Jews for the Christians? Like wtf they're jokes &amp; memes, idc if you like them or not. There were enough Trump bashing jokes, memes and posts on that sub allowed though...

The funniest part is, I was discussing people on that thread and was upvoted more than the people I was responding too, so let's just say I had "support", even for my helicopter joke. The mod who banned me is mod of like 60 subs and used to be a europe mod : https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/3wsla2/reurope_mod_ujebusgobson_censors_a_thread_about/ or here : http://i.magaimg.net/img/mf2.png (this is not my image initially) .  

EDIT: here's anarchism sub advocating mass violence, executions/death, etc. : http://imgur.com/NZKGqt1  

Here's a default powermod (still very active btw) openly calling for the assassination of a politician (Trump) he doesn't like including the supporters: http://archive.is/UIoEf . *Sigh*.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I know I'm late but /r/OutOfTheLoop has become a leftist bastion now, epecially since mods have to apporve questions. Ask anything pro-Trump, pro-right/conservatism or anti-refugees/islam and you're going to be luckily to get it approved, after which it gets downvoted to all hell and no one replies.  

However if you post the 180 opposite of what I stated before, it's a near insta-approved, heavily upvoted, gilded 7 times etc. post.  

For example, ask what's wrong with Trump University or what the controversy around it is, insta posted, insta upvotes etc. Ask what's wrong with the Clinton Foundation, *crickets* even IF you're lucky to get it approved.</div>
