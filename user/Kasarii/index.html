    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, I really think term limits needs to happen sooner rather than later. These career politicians stay in power by crook and hook, they get offered so much lobbying money that they can just throw it at their next campaign and silence their opposition. Repeat that a few times and you get a swamp creature.

If you would like to find out the real truth of what is hijacking the "liberal side" even though they aren't classical liberals anymore you should watch this, it's only an 18 min. long video but it's well worth your time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTxmKc80wUw

Jordan Peterson has spent probably 30 or 40 years studying this and when you hear what he says and explains how the "regressive leftists" function, it really hits you in the gut. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Nope, Russia can barely handle itself. The only thing they want is to prevent terrorist from attacking them, stopping the Qatar-Europe Pipeline going through Syria and avoiding WWIII, their economy sucks and they can't afford to get into any conflicts with anyone.

It's also not a conspiracy, they are doing it right in front of you. The most well known one is George Soros who is practically bragging that he's trying to destabilize the U.S dollar. The same guy who bragged about being the cause of the destabilization in the Ukraine. 

There's a guy called George Webb who is doing investigative journalist work researching the cause of countries destabilization like Libya, Syria, Haiti and now what's going on in the U.S. He's a Bernie supporter that's been making daily videos on youtube since last year.

I'm going to link you a cliff notes post that some person on reddit that has kindly made which has links for all the videos with each summary part. I recommend starting at part 1 if you truly would like to know more.

Even if you are concern trolling me here, I'm still going to post this so other people might check it out.

edit: Going to link [another site](https://idraintheswamp.com/) which records more facts that correlate with the George Webb series for another source. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Don't take this the wrong way by thinking that I'm trying to say your ideas are wrong but something to consider is maybe you haven't just done enough deep research yourself to fully understand what is truly going on. That you might be just seeing a facade top layer of information put out to dis-inform everyone.

I was sucked into this as well and I would consider myself to be more of a moderate person rather than left or right only. I spent enough spare time to look at the facts and not just what someone claimed was true, even when I thought they were legitimate sources at the time.

While yes, terrorism groups including ISIS have been spurred by our actions, it's not just a reaction-response only from them. We have had corrupt officials help make these groups bigger as they wanted to use them as tools to achieve their personal agendas. So while these corrupt officials were part of our nation, the rest of us aren't responsible for these crimes. 

Check out George Webb on YouTube, [this is a good place to start on day 84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioFGJmrvai0). He's a Bernie supporter who has been doing deep investigative work on recent events that have happened in the middle-east, and other places where a lot of shady things have occurred. 

If you have time, I suggest you watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDK1aCqqZkQ) about man-made climate change that interviews Dr. Patrick Moore, PHD in Ecology and founder of Greenpeace. They discuss what's real and what isn't and why.

The fact is that our nation needs both conservatives and liberals to have a healthy functioning society. The liberals create and the conservatives implement, without each other the society stalls and starts to decay.

Ideologies are nothing but a label that describes the type of personality you have. More open minded, artistic but chaotic people are usually Liberal and More close minded, orderly and stable people are usually Conservative. They aren't something to be used as a tribal division where you should divide yourself into groups with other people who have similar ideologues. All it does is create polarization and either makes the two different groups fight, or one becomes the slave of the other. *edit: Free speech is required for both types of people to come together and have a discussion about what is the best way to improve our society.

Check out Dr. Jordan Peterson if you want to find out more about the psyche behind what is going on in today's western culture.

[Here's an interview by Dave Rubin(liberal) with Dr. Peterson.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJSJcPKA1Ug&amp;t=1s), who's a psychologist and tenured professor of psychology at the University of Toronto.

Again, I'm not trying to convince you to change your mind. Just trying to share more information for you to help make a more informed decision about your stances. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They want the polarization to continue so they can come in a offer a new way out of the chaos that seems to be getting worse. When morale is low people will take up that offer not understanding that they are just being lied to and will be giving up their freedom in return for security and stability. Wish more people understood that once you give up your freedom you can't get it back without massive bloodshed.</div>
