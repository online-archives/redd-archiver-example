    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I think "scam" might be a bit harsh, but they are definitely not the environmentally friendly alternative that they once thought they were. I watched the same video a few days ago and found it very informative.

Plus there was a shipping container apartment recently that had to be canceled indefinitely because the containers have gone up in price so much and are hard to find. 

But.. A lot of these things these days don't care about facts, only money.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Another way to look at this is.... People don't give a fuck if they are told a little bit of char can contribute to cancer because EVERYTHING around you does the same thing. Ever been to Cali? Everything has stickers that say "Cali identifies this item as having chemicals that can cause cancer." Everything! 

Better to just enjoy your food and stop worrying about the little things. And I bet the mods see so many people posting about cancer they are sick of it. I would be.

If your afraid then don't eat it. Leave other people enjoy their food.</div>

What's more, the USA, and the FDA, aren't the only government sources in the world. Step out of your bubble for a bit. The USA is one country, there are hundreds of others, and they have approved drugs and treatment that the USA hasn't, usually for monetary reasons.

How did we go from hating our health care system in the USA, and believing it was just a bunch of greedy bastards, to trusting it whole heartedly?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's what I hope. From things I have seen I think it is relatively safe for most people, with a higher chance of some nasty side effects than the FDA usually allows in a drug. Kind of like back in the old phen/fen days when doctors were prescribing drugs they didn't know enough about and a lot of people now have life long heart problems because of it. But... Money.

The truth is its an experimental drug. We don't know the long term side effects because we've never used it before. But it does work in lowering symptoms for the beer bug. So what do you do with an experimental drug we don't know the symptoms for? Force every human in the world to get it, apparently, regardless of their risks from the beer bug. 

Things are messed up.</div>

        </small>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The general group flocking to reddit these days are either marketers, or the masses of unthinking copycat "say whatever gets me liked" types. Generally they stick to the default subs so if you unsub from the defaults and find other subs you will get a better viewing experience. (though that will only last so long) 

Reddit is now a main stream social media platform, and just like all main stream social media it is subject to the whim of the mob. Individuality is thought of as an anathema.

We are in a new Era of communication, and still getting used to it. We, as a species, used to value conformity in order to survive, and it was only over many generations and social upheaval that we started to value individuality... in some countries. But not every culture values individual choice, so when you mix a bunch of cultures together online you're bound to have some clashes.

Hopefully individuality will win... But it's too soon to tell.</div>

They have been afraid of being called racist for some time. That is why they didn't prosecute some of the perps until backlash got too high. Another person was arrested and put in jail for standing outside the court house to covering the story of some of the perps. The person was held in jail for weeks, in general population with people known to have a hit out on the guy. They wanted to cover it up that much.

The 20,000 number has been in various news articles as well. Yes, it's pretty accurate.</div>

Shouldn't we all want that for our kids?</div>

If throwing people in jail and fining them will help if be all for it, unfortunately I don't think it will stop this thinking that anyone who doesn't believe everything I believe should be shut up.</div>

I lost so many friends because I was adamant that pouncing someone for speech is wrong and just makes their position stronger. I got called a few choice words because I prefer to talk to people instead of using violence.

This is the new left. Violent and intolerant.</div>

The thing is they are banking "conservative" voices, but the audience for a them are mostly in the middle politically. Those of us who see there are good points on both sides. If you silence the people I want to hear from so I can make my own decisions I'm just going to follow them to the alternate platforms.

Which is good because then the alternative platforms start getting more diverse thought, and that's what matters most.</div>
