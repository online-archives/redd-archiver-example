    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I just tried reposting it and it was autoremoved so that means one of the words in the title is on their spam filter. (The +1 67% you got must be from us or their mods) What's interesting about that is that there really is no justification for putting anything in that title on the spam filter. For example, while "favorite alternatives" might be a good one to dispel threats to main reddit's monopoly, it'll cause them to run into many problems as people get filtered for asking things like "favorite alternatives to mcdonalds?" I'm going to try and figure out what they have spam filtered and I'll update in this comment:

* Tried removing 'groupthink' and it was still autoremoved

* 'bots' isn't the word

* not 'subreddits'

* not 'crybullies'

* Removing everything after 'daily activity' still gets autoremoved so it's the first half 

* ok so "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink?" doesn't get autoremoved but "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink have less power, there's lots of daily activity?" does, going to see if "daily activity" is the spam filtered

* "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink have less power?" is autoremoved so it might be "have less power"

* "Have less power?" gets autoremoved for being too short

* "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink hav3 les5 pow3r?" isn't autoremoved confirming that "have less power" is filtered</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There's definitely some underlying hatred for white men/christians that's playing into these overreactions. Bari Weiss, a nytimes reporter implied as much on Joe Rogan's podcast yesterday when she said that she initially disliked Nick Sandman (the smirking kid) based solely on the way that he looked because he supposedly reminded her of a bully. She though she masked her racism, but it falls apart when you remember that we don't validate the people on the far right who became racist after being beat up/robbed/raped by a black person. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I was reading through the comments and when I saw [this](http://archive.is/89MBA) one where someone is unironically referring to the guy who grunted like a beast as "she" and "lady" I thought to myself  *ok this person has to be transgender* so I click on their username and holy shit...37 comments in that thread. 

Then it got me thinking; that's literally 2.5% of the comments on the thread. How many more people like this are there in that thread? [Here's](http://archive.is/2R24k) another one I found replying to the first one. Now we're at 4% of the comments in a 1600 comment thread. Almost all of their comments heavily downvoted; they're begging for controversy. And when they inevitably get it: "Bla bla bla this thread has been locked for bigotry bla bla bla." 

The thing is...these threads *always* wind up being locked. And the activists in them never actually win--almost all of the comments from those 2 users are in negative votes. You actually see solidarity among all political backgrounds *against* the trans commenters. But then along come the mods and bail them out by locking and deleting. The transgender question is a ticking time bomb and the way they handle threads about them proves it. The only way to keep it going is to throw a tantrum and then dad comes in "I don't care who started it, everybody go to their rooms now!"</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Purple Mattress was a fun one. 

It was a viral video of a guy from a seemingly neutral mattress review  "exposing" Purple Mattress for selling a hazardous product. The threads had the usual indications of a reddit hysteria: 20k+ upvotes, 5k+ comments, multiple posts on the front page at the same time. 

Being the contrarian I am, I simply comment "hey I'm not convinced because of -obvious circumstantial evidence-" and I get at least 30 accusations of being a shill. Turns out the guy worked for a competing mattress company and was successfully sued in court for punitive damages. Why were Purple able to get punitive damages? Because enough retards on this site fell for the groupthink to cause longterm damage to the company.

Fun fact: HRC's actions in Libya were so destructive that the Pentagon set up a [backchannel](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/28/hillary-clinton-undercut-on-libya-war-by-pentagon-/) to communicate with the Libyan government after it became clear that the goal was to destroy the country to open up human trafficking into europe and [smuggle Gaddafi's weapons into syria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbrOg092GA). What I just linked you is the article that forced me to go from Sanders to Trump instead of "falling in line" with a warmonger.</div>

This is something they will have their hands full with now that they&#39;ve radicalized their userbase</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">In 2016, rPolitics formalized its commitment to radicalizing its userbase when they allowed a news story about a black church being burned+vandalized with "vote trump" writings to gain 30k upvotes, but removed the subsequent story that it was a false flag by a church member at just 87 upvotes for being "off-topic". This is just the most famous of many incidents where subreddits such as rPolitics elicit an emotional response from their users and incite outrage without allowing them to 'come back down' by giving them the full story. Without the full story their audience is unable to humanize the other side resulting in the climate we see today where many rPolitics users legitimately believe that they are living in a nazi-like state and that violence can seemingly be justified to prevent perceived violence. 

However, this clearly does not reconcile with reality, and with each of these top-voted comments reddit loses more and more center/right users. As a result the rPolitics mods, who are likely paid political/media operatives, must now spend the majority of their moderation time policing their own radicalized ideologues to prevent them from damaging their political goals. </div>

edit: they've made the subreddit private now, but i did a lot of research on this in 2016 after they became suppressive over all of the islamic terror attacks. most of the mod accounts that joined worldnews at once are linked through their moderation of whitefragility.</div>

            Comment on: <a href="">Contrary to their standard practice for suspected terrorist attacks, /r/worldnews has censored very few comments in a thread about the Finsbury Park incident, where a white man is suspected of having deliberately attacked a crowd of Muslims. What could possibly be the reason?</a>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">even the mainstream media does this. they've been shoe-horning dylan roof into pretty much every segment this week that involves the shooting of the republican congressman. almost like they're trying to say "don't forget! don't forget! whites are worse! crusades remember!!!"

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The 3 moderators were banned 3 hrs after we found seth rich's twitter handle. The name of that twitter handle was able to be cross-referenced to a seemingly random negative comment made by a dnc staffer. With the context of it being seth rich the dnc staffer is essentially revealing that the dnc knew about seth's involvement in the leaks.
