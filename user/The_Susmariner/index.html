    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is an awesome awesome debate to have, and I appreciate you posting that meme.

I would ask whoever responded to you to show you in the constitution of the United States where the word democracy is. They won't be able to find it. Because the United States is not a constitutional democratic republic by nature, it is a constitutional republic. It just so happens that in practice, we use a democratic means to elect our representatives.

This is discussed in depth in the federalist papers, but those papers also explain why the framers never included the word democracy in the constitution. Though to be fair, the word popular vote comes up in some of the amendments to the constitution.

In essence, I agree with you completely. Everyone is told how beneficial a democracy is, no one ever explains the risks of democracy. And because of that, most people have a very minimal understanding of why, though we as a country incorporate democracy into our system of government, that they were very careful not to delineate us as a democracy and that the constitution goes out of it's way to avoid using the term democracy.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">All right, so you're an idiot then, who puts words in other people's mouths in order to win arguments, and tries to frame every discusion as racist/homophobic/xenophobic/etc. 

Because, and you haven't really provided any substance to go off of, I doubt the merits of whatever argument you might be able to provide are lacking. So you use the old tried and true. 

I'll keep talking about this with other people who want to have an honest conversation about fixing these problems, there's more and more of them everyday, but not with you.

Did you catch that undercurrent? 🤣</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I never said that was the problem, you jumped to that likely to frame this as some sort of racist issue. In reality though the DEI program is a race based program, my issue with DEI has nothing to do with race, rather, that it's an ineffective program.

All I know is that I think almost everyone would agree that if they had a doctor that was going to perform a surgery, or a pilot, or some sort of person who is doing something that could realistically result in *your* death, as in it directly impacts your personal life. That *you* would want the most qualified candidate whether that person is black, brown, white, red or purple.

My problem with DEI is that it does nothing to actually increase the talent of the person that is being hired, and doesn't really fix any problems and that the real issue is that a lot of impoverished (not black, not asian, not white, but impoverished) communities don't have access to the same level of education, job opportunity, etc. that other communities have that produce qualified candidates. Just giving someone a job as a diversity hire doesn't help that person at all or the company they were hired to. And this is coming from someone who believes there are disadvantaged communities in this country. We could go back and forth for hours on why that is. Point being. DEI isn't effective as it doesn't correct the root cause of the problem and likely does more harm than good to everyone.

As to your point on Union jobs, I wish I knew more about it, but I trust that there is merit to your claim and it's likely that all of these problems combine to make a bigger problem.</div>
