What your mom makes for din din Mac and cheese with hot dogs. I bet she brings you a plate so you can stay on reddit, doesn't she 



The reason you're a troll I showed you how the federal government started a D&I program that was allowing unqualified people to become atc. Your response is that it's  not happening anymore. You can not admit what the faa did was wrong, and its sole purpose was to pick colored, gay or Trans candidates over those who had certifications, so what's the point . Any evidence I've shown is not good enough. Just Today I hear a argument with atc on the radio. My captains response was, " D&I's finest hire may be in a little trouble," and he made a report just because we heard it. I live this every day it's an issue. I really do not care what your viewpoints are.

But I am 100% sure if you were on a flight that almost collided with another aircraft from incompetent atc, you would care. The u.s hasn't had a large fatal plane crash or a wide body crash in an amazing amount of time, but it's coming, and it will be the result of the faa enacting policies like "Be atc"</div>

It's funny my rant shows d&I programs literally sole intent was to hurt only group to help another so your fine with that. My rant showed the FAA was cherry picking candidates based on color I guess your fine with that. My rant proved the faa was picking the least qualified candidates Over those who finished the college program I guess your are fine with that. And lastly it prove that the faa was picking candidates that wouldn't have been qualified under the old system over candidates that went to the program the faa started and those candidates were  punished because of that. I guess your fine knowing at any moment unqualified atc,s could cause a catastrophic crash. But hey they took some questioning off so it's ok now</div>

Unemployed colored candidates received more more points than candidates who went to college and had and atc certification. The more points the better the chances of passing to the next phase. Active pilots would received 2 points for being a pilot but a colored person who was bad at science got 10. I'm not macking it up the FAA was sued and lost over this they changed the questionnaire but it still rewards more points to colored,  gay or Trans candidates</div>

They still use the point system and the ASTA still has questions about employment and school subject with more points being awarded to unemployed. You are cherry picking points to say who care it's changed. Was this right to do in the first place. Was this fair to people who went to college and finished the atc program. Funny you have no issue with the way the test penalized those candidates. Leads me to believe you must have never applied your self and been screwed  because of a program like this. I had to do the same process every other America pilot had to complete with 1500hrs and multiple years or training to become a pilot if someone could bypass all that and be hired because of color is that fair</div>

The faa was sued and it was no longer allowed to be a take home queationaire. The main issue is the hires that made it thru with the original queationaire are responsible for the increasing incidents.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'll explain as it pertains to the faa and atc .During the Obama administration, the FAA moved to ‘off the street’ hiring with diversity as a criteria, passing over graduates of FAA-approved university air traffic control programs.The FAA launched the Collegiate Training Initiative in 1997, working with colleges and universities to offer air traffic control degrees, and making their graduates the primary source for hiring controllers. This trumped the previous requirement of a high school degree and three years of (unrelated) work experience. In 2005 the FAA Inspector General recommended adding coursework to these schools to reduce training time at the FAA’s academy. The FAA didn’t do this, and Congress directed a study of the move in agency’s 2012 reauthorizatio

Instead, during the Obama administration, the FAA started an Air Traffic Controller Recruitment Campaign which bypassed graduates. A decision made by the FAA, and not by the Air Traffic Organization, meant that both high school graduates and those with air traffic control degrees had to apply through the same program and pass both the standard aptitude test for controllers and a biographical test. This change had the effect of bypassing hundreds of controller graduates.


Facing pressure to diversify an overwhelmingly white workforce, the FAA began using a biographical test as a first screen of candidates.
Meanwhile, minority candidates were fed “buzz words” to bump their resumes up to top priority. Apparently saying your worst subject in school was science served as a golden ticket. Correct answers to the take-home test to groups who fit the diversity the FAA was after. a class action lawsuit brought by Collegiate Training Initiative students who got passed over has uncovered some pretty bad hiring practices at the FAA.  


So here's what the questionnaire includes: as of 2022

A question as to what your worst subject was in school. There were several options, including science, math, and a few others. The BEST answer for you to give was that "Science" was your WORST subject. 10 points for that answer. More points is better.

A question about how many suggestions you had made to your employer in the last 3 years. The BEST answer (10 points) was that you were not employed in the last 3 years and therefore made no suggestions. (In other words, it's a disguised question designed to determine whether you have been employed in the last 3 years, and you get 10 points if you have not been.)

In another question: 10 points for having no relevant experience, 4 points for having ATC experience, 2 points for being a pilot. 

In short, it's a questionnaire designed to ask questions that technically are permissible, in order to determine information that it is illegal to ask directly in screening: what's your race or ethnic background.

To dumb it down points are given to candidates. Pilots or college graduates of the FAA program are given 2 points per question but a person of color and high school graduates get 10 points. A white person bad a science would not get the same amount of points as a colored person who was bad a science. A white person who played sports did not receive receive points where. Color or gay person who did not play sports would get points. The more points a candidate has the better the chances are to getting hired and trained.  The FAA has since changed the questionnaire in 2022 the point value is still used and pilots or graduates of the college ATC Academy started by the FAA do not have a better chance than someone with just a diploma. 

The issue is coming to ahead now with increasing runway incursions and mid air collisions caused by atc not doing their job. Last year there was 4 very close calls with planes being less that 200ft apart from a collision. The other problem is the amount of tax payer money being used to catch applicants up to those who payed  for college to earn a certification from the atc academy  and not having the employees stay long enough to recoup the cost of training. Since 2019 the data show more pilot reported atc deviations( pilot reporting atc because of unsafe conditions created by atc or for a hostile exchanges)</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Typical woke redditor linked a video that shows every argument I have and that data but woke redditors just have them mentality that if I don't like it, then it's false.   Are you pilots? Are you paying attention to the clear rise in incidents involving atc mishaps. Has your life been at risk from an air traffic controller that would never have been qualified to be one until D&I started I bet you would take it more seriously if you had a close call or it affected your life everyday. Do you as a pilot it's harder for me to become an air traffic controller than someone who has no experience but is of color and didn't participate in sports who is not good a science. The way the Faa has the test set up a pilot on gets 2 points, and someone with atc experience gets 1 but a colored/gay person who has zero aviation experience that only graduated high school gets 10 for color 10 for high school graduate. The candidate with the most points gets moved to the next test, so please argue that makes sense. I would love to see you try. 

   The boy at the flight club I belonged to couldn't get hired as an atc when he has multiple certifications, has been doing virtual atc for 10 years, and graduated college and holds a private pilot license because he is not gay and has a degree now how is that fair. I work for a major air carrier, and a union representative sends out statistics about D&I it's clear it does not work in all fields. It may work in sales or marketing,  teaching, but I'm sorry color should not qualify a person over a person with actually experience</div>

The first one shows the increase in serious atc mishaps since the THE FAA started the programs.  You have no data saying it's beneficial, so like I said, time is proving my point, not yours. It's just a matter of time until a fatal incident occurs and it's a D&I atc that caused it. I find it funny that your only argument is I dont believe you when I have shown you 3 examples that support my argument, but you are so woke you can not take the time to watch them. As someone who interacts with atc and spends time talking to other pilots, it's a serious concern that people lives are at risk being woke won't stop that</div>

Your response is the typical woke reddit response. If CNN would actually report on it, then they could be used as a source. And do you actually think I'm going to share the email a major u.s airline sent about this or the email the union sent to all pilots just to prove a point.

Yes, they are lower quality because they would never have been qualified to hold that position until the qualifications were lowered to allow for a more diverse pool of candidates. That has nothing to do with race, sex or religion. It's like saying only people who went to college  and have a masters degree could apply for the Job before d&I. With the D&I now people with a high school equivalent could apply. Do you really think that's fair  plus now the company has to spend more money on training a person for a job they are not qualified to hold 10 years ago. Again, this is an example only, but people who are racist like you only jump to one conclusion. Try to find one company that started d&I for Blacks only, but in your mind, anyone who says d&I is bad for the company and the results speak for themselves is against blacks and racist. In fact, the colored people who actually have the education and knowledge and went to school are hurt just as much by d&I as everyone else</div>

    I do not think i should have to detail my private life to show you I'm far from being a bigot or racist but reddit always believes that if someone doesn't think like me, they are racist. In my face, I would have an African American wife right now if the world didn't decide her life was going to be cut short. 
  I take offense to the fact that you group me as a racist because I'm smart enough to see the issue with d&I hiring I'm some fields of work. Clearly, you're racist and you must not really realize how racist you are. You assumed I'm white and would never care about people of color when my whole life I've spent loving or falling in love not based on color but on who the person is.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">And I'm not saying they are lower quality. I'm saying that when you allow people to apply, that would not meet the standards to apply before they changed the requirements to allow for D&I hiring you get a pool of candidates that cost more for training and in the end the results speek for themselves. The color of your skin doesn't mean you can't perform as well as other colors there is no link saying that but picking employees based solely on D&I allows for people that may not be good enough for the job no matter the color of their skin or sexuality.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Internal memorandums detailed lowering the requirements and aptitude testing to ensure candidates could be eligible to be hired based solely on the diversification needs of the company. They lowered the standards to allow a larger candidate pool and then hired not on skill or how competent the person would be for the position  but based more on being able to hired based on gender ,race, or belief. Look, it's black and white before to become an air traffic controller. The person would have to go thru a rigorous application process, proving they could cope with the environment and would be competent in the position one allowed the applicant would start at lower, less populated airports. 
    Since the FAA  decided to start D&I hires, the test was changed and literally has questions that a 5th grade student would know and took any questions that could lower the candidate pool out. 
   What has been the result, a large increase in major runway incursions, increased collision alerts, and more pilot reported atc deviations. They explicitly stated that hiring and training a person will not necessarily bring that person up to the standards needed. You know, as well as I do, that not everyone can hold certain jobs not because of color or sexuality but because not everyone has the same level of mental competence. 
   As far as Boeing, they are finding out the same thing, and you can not train a person to hold a position that was hired based solely D&I and expect that person to perform as well as a person who has the knowledge and skill from previous work experience.  

   As a pilot I have seen multiple people who want to be a pilot but have to give up because the skills needed do not care about who you are flying a aircraft is a huge responsibility and not everyone can perform or gain the knowledge and skill needed . Now, are you telling me my company should hire a pilot based on the color of the skin, not how well they can perform well guess what? That's what they are tired of,and  they have since stopped the d&I hiring. Wonder why well the number of candidates that did not meet the requirements and the amount of money they spent trying was too costly and it's a very large, well-known domestic carrier. I've been told they even stopped ground crew D&I  hires because of the increase in safety violations and reported violations of company procedures. I'm not saying they fired or stopped hiring colored, Trans, or says they stopped hiring people who were clearly not qualified but was hired anyway</div>

People like you will never admit that hiring practices based on d&I and not skill hurts every group of color. Indians have the highest percentage of college education citizens, but they may not get a job in America because of d&I. The job may go to the less qualified  candidates that fit the diversity the company needs or wants. D&I does not favor African Americans, the intention was to help all people,  Trans, colored, poor, rich, gay , straight,  white,</div>
