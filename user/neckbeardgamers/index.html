    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah Turks are definitely cancerous ultra-nationalist shitheads with few exceptions. So all their vote brigading and vote bots could mostly be individual efforts divorced from the Turkish state. But it is impossible to say since only admins have the powers to find out and this medium is anti-transparency and admins don't publicize any info about the huge Turkish efforts on Reddit, instead as I complained in this writeup Reddit officially backs up their media and government by whining about Russia's much less effective social media efforts that I and everyone else cannot notice.. The best proof I could scrounge due to this lack of disclosure by admins was a trove of info in the posts by a mod of /r/syriancivilwar, /u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, that shows there is heavy Turkish botting activity on after he asked admins to investigate the funny vote games on that sub:    
https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/85jilt/reddits_massive_turkish_vote_brigade_problem/dw79v3j/

Reddit is a medium that is so easy to game that they are able to massively dominate the discourse despite their country attacking every Western and European nation and generating a lot of bad will. Even the shithead Turkish Redditors just attack everyone as belonging to a PKK supporter nation, amplifying the bad will of Erdogan's mouth. But still on thread after thread I see views only Turks hold bully through despite their disadvantage of belonging to a pariah nation. For example here Turks manage to once again bully through on /r/europe their love for Ataturkmania and a distortion of a German scholar's work:   

https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ah0ic/meanwhile_in_a_bookshop_in_turkey_allah_in_the/dwymsba/ 

&gt;/r/combatfootage - there is a thread that is ironically specifically talking about turks and their vote-brigading 

Can you link to that thread? </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I used to think it was that Turks were leveraging irc/slack/discord to massively swarm and gain local superiority. But a /r/syriancivilwar mod who noticed funny voting patterns complained to admins and posted that there were turkish vote bots and turkish report bots activated on that sub and targeted users:   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/85jilt/reddits_massive_turkish_vote_brigade_problem/dw79v3j/

Obviously a vote bot was released in this thread too. I am complaining to a mod here and gonna ask him to complain to an admin on my behalf. 

And you Turks don't know what racism is. Turkish ethos is that Turks cannot possibly be racist and imperialist, even when that is what they are being:   

&gt;http://koreaofmideast.blogspot.com/2016/11/turks-cannot-be-imperialist-it-is.html

Turkish state policies and popular opinion are massively racist. Turks make white America seem unracist.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I used [Reddit comment search](https://redditcommentsearch.com/) and found a trove of info in the posts of the mod of /r/syriancivilwar /u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof  that shows there is heavy Turkish botting activity on Reddit:   

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwue7f    

&gt;Absolutely there are regular users here. But bot karma gets reversed. My comments in the last few hours have not all been upvoted 30+ times. That's bot karma. This thread? It was at 12% upvoted at one point. Now it's on the front page. Every single comment on this thread, regardless of opinion or support, was below -15.

&gt;...

&gt;I'm calling bots because I've spoken with reddit admins and they've confirmed there are bots in use. I will repeat from my previous comment. All comments in a thread do not drop below the comment threshold without botting. Comments on this sub do not gain 40 points in an hour. When all my comments (even on other subreddits) go down to -20 at the same time, that's not regular people. You don't see karma scores, the mod team can.

And: 

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwtg47

&gt;Point me to one instance when a Kurd used bots to downvote entire threads to -30. Just one. You won’t be able to. I hate talking like this, and the other mods can testify, but there is absolutely no comparison to what has happened to the sub in the past two months. There had been huge vote brigading on this sub. When a propaganda picture of some random special forces soldier gets to 120 points in three hours, but YPG ATGM videos are never getting past 65% upvotes. There’s a problem. ...

&gt;I have never seen brigading as blatant and obvious as with what has happened in the last few months. There are bots assigned to downvote posts from pro-YPG sources instantly. There are bots assigned to several pro-Turkish users (who are longtime good and civil contributors) that upvote their stuff automatically. There are tons of reports every day that are extremely racist against Kurds. People like u/dodo91 had bots attached to his account downvoting literally every comment to ~-40. u/HenryPuot had (and probably still has) a report bot attached to his account. There is a concentrated level of trolling on this sub that hasn’t been seen since the Russian intervention. The pro-Kurdish circlejerk could get bad at times, yes. But we never had them mass-reporting things they didn’t like in attempts to get people banned outside of a few exceptions I can count on one hand. We never had bot armies downvoting posts they didn’t like so they never reached the front page. We never had dozens of alt accounts constantly send harassing messages to pro-Turkish users. We never had numerous posts of goreposting memes from them.

&gt;I hate that I have to even explain this. It is completely evident what is causing problems on this sub.

&gt;...

And:   
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwl4n6  

&gt;Yeah the admins can see who does the downvoting and they ban those accounts. Sometimes they IP ban, though the users get around it easy, most in Turkey already have VPNs. But there's a lot of bots. At least 30 are in use right now. There's also report brigading going on.   

And: 
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwkhs9  

&gt;Normal users? No. But with bots yes. Remember, every user banned can't upvote or downvote. The admins were quick to act just an hour ago when I got some bots. Hopefully the same thing happens here.

And:    
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwkapk   
&gt;I agree. This is getting ridiculous. Some comments here are at -20. I've already got one set of bots banned today. God willing more will come now. On the bright side, it gets reversed after like 8 hours.

And:   
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/82gug3/muntasrbillah_brigade_captured_one_black_market_sugar_depot_of_the_ypg_mili/dv9z0y3   

&gt;Heads up. People either have bots assigned to you( /u/flintsparc ) or are downvoting everything on your account. This was at -2 before I approved it.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I wonder how I wake up and there are 23 replies to my posts, almost all of them in this thread, almost all of them by Turks and see about 9 Turks posting in this thread and all their comments with talking points that only Turks agree with massively upvoted to 40+, 30+, 17 points, etc., which is a huge swing in a few hours for such a tiny subreddit. At first I thought it was because of irc/slackchat/discord but seeing this thread I see that totesmessenger bot informs everyone that this thread was crossposted to many other subs including the den of brigaders, /r/Turkey. Normally in the past I would get such notifications of crossposts to my Reddit inbox, but I think Reddit changed and without the totesmessenger comment I wouldn't have known. 

How do Turks achieve this again and again? **How do they bully talking points that only Turks agree with all the time to be the most upvoted comments, despite living in a generally despised country whose leaders have literally insulted every powerful demographic on Reddit? Does any Turk have the actual honesty to divulge why this happens again and again?**

Here is a comment by a mod in /r/syriancivilwar after I made this thread complaining they have seen Turkish bot action:  

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkishbacked_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their/dvwk3hq/        
&gt;As everyone can see, there's been an issue with vote manipulation in this thread. It's been sent off to the admins.

&gt;...

&gt;Normal users? No. But with bots yes. Remember, every user banned can't upvote or downvote. The admins were quick to act just an hour ago when I got some bots. Hopefully the same thing happens here.     

A rare Turk even complained publicly on /r/syriancivilwar about the massive Turkish vote brigading:   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85elv5/a_request_from_mods/

&gt;And I want to tell the Turkish users this:     
&gt;You don't downvote a post because you don't like it. ...

One of the mods there even wrote they know about the massive vote brigading:   

&gt;We have contacted the Reddit admins about the massive brigading. Some of the downvoting seems to have been reversed after a few hours.

A year ago someone complained again in syriancivilwar about the massive Turkish brigades and shenanigans. /u/Pruswa who was a Turkish mod of the sub at the time wrote this a year ago:   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/56grue/question_did_this_subreddit_become_proturkey/d8j6dh6/

&gt;&gt;Wouldnt be surprised if maj. of those accounts belong to the same few users.

&gt;We have concerete evidence to support this, in case you are wondering.

During the Afrin invasion Turkish troops, probably mostly Bordo berelis who are literally recruited from ultra-nationalist/Islamist Grey Wolf fascists were taking photos all over the place with Grey Wolf hand signs and making Pan-turanist graffiti. Turkey is a society like if the NDSAP of Germany were lionized and normalized or if the KKK of the USA were normalized.

Thanks for proving my point how Turks massively vote brigade threads. </div>

Also if it was up to most American citizens Turkey would be sanctioned by now. If it was up to Congress and the Senate, Turkey would be sanctioned by now. The State Department stepped in with its extreme support of realpolitik to save the Turkish bandit state for now. But eventually the Turkish governments' constant outbursts will create enough momentum for sanctions against Turkey and eventual expulsion from NATO. Already now most American think-tanks, pundits and policy analysts are starting to say Turkey should be removed from NATO. Sanctions for some Turkish banks will probably happen for the illegal Reza Zarrab gold trading with Iran that kept the teetering Turkish economy afloat, shoring up their trade deficit. </div>

Like the Western corporate, mainstream media Reddit too is obsessed with a "Russian under every bed." Despite the hysteria, I don't notice Russian viewpoints getting any traction on this medium, what I notice instead is Turkish vote brigaders, trolls, etc., strong-arming over and over again viewpoints that are not popular in the West, but that are instead the official arguments of [the Turkish bandit state.](http://koreaofmideast.blogspot.com/2013/03/turkey-bandit-state.html) I posit that part of the eery success of Turkish viewpoints on Reddit is due to the censoring stance Reddit Turks jibbing well with the vanity or Reddit's ultra-nerd moderators. Turks have to be massively using the report/snitch function of Reddit as even the German Marshall Fund indicates more than 1/3rd of Turks think the supporters of the Turkish political party they hate the most shouldn't be allowed to vote.  Instead of defending free speech, Reddit's cancerous neckbeard mods feel empowered by the constant Turkish reports to censor comments and ban users and the excuse to otherwise perform moderator actions. So rather than take action against the censorship loving, whining Turks, the mods do the opposite again and again. This deficiency of Reddit moderating culture combines with the fanatic ultra-nationalism of Turks, and the official trolling/botnet efforts of the Turkish state, so that Turkish viewpoints that are really abhorred in our societies are able to again and again gain massive traction on the [fake frontpage of the internet.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddit-is-not-the-front-page-of-the-internet) </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">UPDATE! For fucks sake, I finally got the post through:     
https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7u6rtz/til_cocacola_was_accused_of_hiring_hitmen_from_a/dtqdt9x/?context=3  

Apparently the issue was the Google search links. Why the hell would a bot, automod or the spam filter not allow Google search links? I didn't think of that. But I wasted many hours of my life trying to pass the stupid invisible fitlers, complaining about the invisible filters. 

**WHY DOES THIS SHITHOLE MEDIUM HATE TRANSPARENCY!!!!***

Also I tried recently to post this to /r/feminism, but it also got filtered out:   

&gt;https://www.ceddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/7uxhr8/jay_z_a_poor_excuse_for_a_husband/     

&gt;

&gt;Ugh gross, another nerdy redditor posting about Game of Thrones the book series, pokemon go, and other immature, distracting dreck acting like they are the life of parties, in the real world.

&gt;In any case, neither you or the other ninny added anything to the conversation/debate for good reason: you are not capable of it.

&gt;People like Beyonce don' t wake up and personally decide to act like what 40 years ago would be considered by all the behavior of a slut or a whore. They are forced to either comply with selling themselves sexually as an object or facing the likely prospect of losing their slot(or should I write slut?) as an international pop-star. There are so many wanna-bes and young up and comers and people like Beyonce must know that alot of people are hungry to displace her. The second she refuses to play the game, she will be replaced and the next sexy body that has a passable singing voice will take her place as one of the most over-promoted female pop/hip hop cross-over stars.

Again I wasted alot of time, but I thought to myself what would they auto-censor like twats there. Then it hit me and I changed it to sluut and wh0re and the post went through finally after many failed attempts:

But that is not such a good example, therightstuffdotbiz is a shitty and niche site. Do you know a better example that is widely popular and actually has useful content, that can never get past the Reddit spam filter? 

**The worst thing though is that millions of users are wasting billions of hours writing posts that in most likelihood they don't know aren't getting through or why. That is extremely disrespectful.** Probably the retards behind this despicable medium think the lack of notification that posts aren't appearing and why is justified to "keep one step ahead of trolls and spammers", ignoring the billions of wasted hours of innocent users... </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I think this sub focuses too much on bitching about petty actions of one mod or group of mods, or sub and ignores the structural issues that make Reddit a shithole. There must be millions or tens of millions of posts a day that are shadow deleted like the post I cited above. Further, I think most Redditards don't even have the awareness to know it is happening -- to them it is just another post that for some reason didn't get a response. In this case it because the default automod, a custom automod setting or some bot deleted it so some nerdy moderators can feel good about their useless lives. Most Reddit neckbeard mods seem to think that the more moderator actions they commit the greater the good they are doing and somehow they are making their subs better, so to them when automod and/or bots delete hordes of posts for frivolous reasons it is a great development...

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Another super user nerd of Reddit with 4,810,729 post karma. See what happens on Reddit? 

How did they even find this thread on a pathetically small, niche subreddit? Well all these super nerds are always on a persistent chat client like irc, slackchat or discord discussing Reddit 24/7 and they inform each other of threads like this. That is why Reddit is a shithole, because brigading is only not allowed for us plebs who do it via Reddit, but all the biggest Reddit geeks do the same on persistent chat channels where Reddit admins say it is ok:   

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/61twfz/i_think_reddits_doxxing_policyrule_needs/dfix6vd/

&gt;

 &gt;We will take action against users that post another user's personal information, either directly on reddit or linking to it off-site. ... However, we usually cannot rely on screenshots because they are easily faked. If this is all occurring off-site and not being posted anywhere on reddit, then there is usually little we can do ...

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">/u/u/ShaneH7646 has 749,935 total karma and mods a ridiculous number of subs, in other words he is another professional Redditor and probably an internet friend of fellow karma whore Gallowboob. But unlike Gallow he probably makes no money from his Reddit activity, while Boob at least spinned it into his career. He probably released that photo just so it would be widely discussed and he probably even did the photoshop or one of his friends... 

That is just the first thing I thought of after seeing the photo, I immediately thought even in the original, "that man has no ass". Also most people are not friendless nerds like you guys and Reddit is not our social lives. You should watch this Youtube video where based Tyron mocks the geeks whose life highlight is janitoring on 4chan:   
["Janitor on /sp/ gets BTFO"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdC_Cu9X4wc)  
The same applies to Reddit super-moderators of 50+ subs like you. 

Btw, Gallowbob even PM'ed me:   
&gt;shhh is okk  

&gt;everything will be fine in the afterlife
