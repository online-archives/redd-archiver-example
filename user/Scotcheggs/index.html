Just because they are publically funded by the British doesn't mean they aren't owned by social engineering sjws. They fired off all their semi redpilled old timer celebs in favour of gay jewish ethnic etc celebs and they are appaling to watch anymore. The only reason they are still around is because of how heavily they bully people into buying a tv license but they need to die miserably or become a soley private company as they do not represent the interests of the British public. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Yeah those contrived interviews are a surefire way to knowing the job will be shit. The question I fucked up on was &quot;name a time you gave extra special favour to a client and went beyond your role&quot;. Only problem was is that I worked a government job and had to stick to a certain procedure or else I would be fired. There was no way to answer that question since if I did anything like give my own opinion or checked out anything outside our remit it would lead to disciplinary action. Anyways. I wasn't selected for that shit job but found something else that pays better and is more relaxed. Any harsh corporate textbook interviews you know the company will be shit. There are companies still out there that will reward you for what you're worth rather than being able to answer tacky contrived interview questions that are ultimately meaningless. Best jobs are ones where you interview in person and speak honestly rather than answering some computer generated questions. Also any job that does group interviews will also be shit. If you fail in that sort of atmosphere just know that those jobs are ultimately shit and there are better out there. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I've heard interviews can't predict employee performance at all. I've been a top performer at most of my jobs but am terrible at interviews. As an example I just had an interview with a company and screwed up on the first question (brain fart mode) and knew from there it was over for me. The job I work now I wasn't even interviewed. They said based on my CV I have enough experience and I started straight away. The job I have now pays more and has better hours etc than the tough interview job. When they pull that draconian interview shit on you they are just trying to give the impression that you should be submissive to them and feel honoured for being selected for a crappy job. When the interview is relaxed and they feel you out from your CV etc instead of asking contrived questions the whole work environment will usually be much better. </p></div>
