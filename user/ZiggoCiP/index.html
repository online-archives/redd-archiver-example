    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">From a privacy stand-point, I get it.  I really do - no one wants to see someone they know being brutally killed, specially if you see their face.

However, it *was* mostly an optics thing, and once the media became aware of WPD it was all over.  For most, the quarantine was just writing on the wall, since it was mostly unexpected given it's timing.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Right after it happened, NZ authorities put a gag-order on the video footage, primarily because it was from the murderer himself and the legal and moral ramifications were very particular.  

Basically NZ was forcing websites to take the video down, but WPD just couldn't help themselves of their morbid curiosity.  

A few mainstream figures tweeted about it, including a terribly shit stickied post on WPD by one of the mods Iammrpositive who right after it happened said 'we are locking the post, but refuse to take the video down', where he was susceded by head mod Tejmar who stickied a thread saying "admins are banning and taking down the video, stop posting it".

Of course no one really listened to Tej, and several threads broke through linking to it, and it was basically the final straw for admins.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">More-so Reddit bending over for them so advertisers don't run away.

The kid shooting himself on camera live was an honest freak occurence, since it was less that he killed himself for the world to see - which has happened before on WPD and not caused a stir - but that his mom came in and basically doxxed herself when the audio picked up her phone call to police.

Because it took place in the US, Reddit got raked over the coals, and WPD got more attention than they ever had before.  

Also like I said, there was an internal power struggle between mods who wanted the sub devoid of gallows humor, and those who didn't see a problem with it.  The end result were 2 mods being removed, one getting doxxed and leaving, and the admins settling with mods and not doing anything - for a time.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They were actually banned for several reasons, the main ones being related to last year when that kid killed himself on YouTube live, and the media realized it popped up on WPD first before anywhere else.

This resulted in an internal war between mods where 2 tried to stage a coup and take over, or have admins ban the sub.  It almost worked too, except the community rallied en masse, myself included, and messaged admins explaining how the community helped more than it hurt.

The fate was short-lived though, and months later in the slew of alt-right sub bans, WPD got hit out of the blue, the reason being privacy-related, which stemmed back to the kid killing himself video, and fueled by instances like the 2 Danish women who were murdered in Morocco by terrorists.

It was never really about the violence - it was about exposure, and WPD had a *very* active community, which last night caused them to seek out the NZ footage ad museum, resulting in the ban.  </div>
