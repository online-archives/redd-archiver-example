Go back to worshipping Trump like the god that you think he is since it’s all you post about. If anyone’s kissing feet here it’s you. Loyalty to a terrible man over your country, you should be ashamed of yourself. History will remember people like you and not in a good way.

And what the fuck is a BLM prayer? Stop watching OANN you braindead fuck, it’s not good for you.</div>

It’s like saying that someone that supports MAGA is complicit in the January 6th event, it’s not true.

Also, you’ve offered no more proof that Biden is racist than I did for Trump, and I’m sure I could find way more corroborating stories of trump being racist than joe Biden being racist. This is coming from someone who reluctantly voted for trump in 2016 *because* of concerns about his racist past. It’s not bullshit that’s being fed to me by the media, I’d argue that it’s quite the opposite here my friend.

Stop watching OANN/Fox.</div>

Never said I supported any sort of organization, BLM itself is a movement which I think overall has an agreeable ideology. Most groups that organize in the name of BLM however I disagree with because most times they exist as a product of “woke culture”

&gt;Biden has a long history of blatant racism. So many hard R's, even in official government meetings.

I mean.. so does trump. I voted trump in 2016 and might have again if he didn’t blatantly use dog whistles and spew BS about COVID (which directly led to several personal losses for me). I chose the lesser of two evils.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I’m not on the left, you’re assuming things about me just like the mods of that subreddit did. I support the idea behind BLM because racial injustice is a real thing in this country. I voted trump in 2016 and decided to vote for Biden in 2020 because I lost family members to COVID because of bullshit spewed by Trump. I am far from left/liberal.

Judging me by my vote and my single belief on a social issue (which I was using as examples to show that I’m not a racist) is exactly what the mods of that sub did to me when I made a comment asking why the use of the word “honkies” was allowed. You’re doing the same thing.

Let me say it again for you.. you’re doing the same thing.</div>
