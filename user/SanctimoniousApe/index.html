You'd know to let the people who have more of a clue than you lead the way on how to proceed. You wouldn't waste valuable time trying to turn a disease which doesn't care who it infects into a political propaganda weapon.

I don't blame Trump for the virus. I ***DO*** blame him for ignoring the threat for two fucking months until he could no longer avoid dealing with it because it was already killing so many Americans.

Fuck Trump and fuck the Republicans who still back him.</div>

This is why Reddit desperately needs some method of counter-balancing said power, but I'm sure that will never happen until something occurs that makes a large percentage of users go elsewhere.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's a shame this wasn't the reply you posted because it's a far better explanation.  Regardless, what you wrote - while sounding like a common complaint among actual racists - certainly didn't really qualify as "racism," which to me is judging (or treating unfairly/differently) someone based on race.  There was no judging of anyone here, although you didn't make your point very clearly and so it was very open to interpretation. You should've known that racism is one of several very sensitive topics and that you'd need to be very careful in how you approached the topic to avoid misinterpretations.

It's absurd how easily people get banned with no recourse but appealing to the very people who banned you in the first place, who too often are biased themselves and unlikely to be honest with themselves (let alone anybody else) and admit they might've made a mistake and been too quick to judge by initial appearance themselves. I've long complained Reddit needs a better process in place.</div>

In a purportedly general purpose sub like news your complaint would make sense, but this... ...it just looks like so much manufactured outrage. TFB.</div>
