When it moves the Overton window

Discussion of topics isn't the issue. Presenting two ideas as equals and lending crackpot conspiracy theories some semblance of legitimacy is the problem.

For example:

Discussions like... Are the Nazis actually the bad guys? Was Hitler right?

Are unacceptable, Have no right to exist, and the only correct response to their introduction is immediate and absolute rejection and dismissal.

They are not valid, there is literally nothing to be discussed. Whoever suggested them is immediately and objectively wrong. Period. Irrefutably undebatable.

Simply allowing certain topics to be discussed gives them some semblance of validity, especially when you allow those topics to be discussed freely and openly.

This is not to say we shouldn't have free speech, you should have the right to say whatever you want.

 However the response to something as ludicrous as saying covid was created in a lab in wuhan should be exactly what happened. Immediately shut down and banned. It is settled science at this point. Dozens of scientific papers have definitively proven and concluded that multiple genetic sequences in Covid are IMPOSSIBLE to artificially synthesize.

It literally could not have been created. Thousands of Doctors and PhDs have collaborated and analyzed the entire pandemic start to finish. It was zoonotic. Not created. End of story.

Insinuating that the Wuhan lab theory is anything more than a crackpot QAnon conspiracy theory imagined up by flatearthers should not be tolerated whatsoever.

Giving the discussion even the slightest time of day lends it an heir of legitimacy which is completely unacceptable. 

If your opinion is anything except disdain for topics such as this you are wrong and you should be ashamed for having such a stupid opinion.

Certain topics need to be policed. Bad actors, the ignorant, and the uneducated NEED to be bullied, punished, and shamed for suggesting objectively false and stupid ideas.

Depending of course on their level of insistence that such topics are worthy of discussion, if someone innocently suggests or promotes an idea that is clearly wrong, but they are just inexperienced on the subject, that can be politely shut down...

But when you have far right wing proponents asserting bigoted, racist, Zionist, sexist ideas etc, as true, even with substantial and definitive evidence to the contrary... They move the Overton window and cause legitimate harm to society. This cannot be allowed.

This is why women don't have equality and are losing fucking rights in 2024 and human rights are regressing</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>Do either of these "feminists" care that females still don't have to register for selective service?

God you're woefully uneducated. Women's rights activists have been pushing for women's selective service for years

Republicans keep voting no.

https://rollcall.com/2021/07/23/conservatives-riled-up-over-registering-women-for-draft/

From the article:

But Cotton tweeted Friday his opposition to women registering with the Selective Service. 

“Our military has welcomed women for decades and are stronger for it,” he said. “But America’s daughters shouldn’t be drafted against their will. I opposed this amendment in committee, and I’ll work to remove it before the defense bill passes.”

Hawley also tweeted about the issue Friday.

“I voted against forcing women to enter the draft, and here’s why,” he said. “American women have heroically served in and alongside our fighting forces since our nation’s founding. It’s one thing to allow American women to choose this service, but it’s quite another to force it upon our daughters, sisters, and wives. Missourians feel strongly that compelling women to fight our wars is wrong and so do I.”

You don't get to bitch about women not having to sign up for the draft when  Republicans literally won't let them.

>Have either of these ladies advocated for a harsh scrutiny of the court system and how unfair the laws are about custody of a child after separation/divorce? Have either of these ladies cared about how male suicide rate is higher?

Idgaf about either of these idiots. Modern feminism addresses and acknowledges these issues. If you dont then you're a radfem Terf and it an actual feminist.

You don't get to point at terfs and say "that's feminism"

The equivalent is pointing at the Qanon Shaman and saying he represents All Republicans

Refusing to acknowledge that is being academically dishonest, purposely disingenuous, and YES, misogynistic.

You don't get to paint all feminists as radicals to justify your mysogeny.

>Also, there is very much equality in the west

Demonstrably false.

>Not sure what inequalities there are left. 

Reproductive rights. Healthcare...

Republicans are trying to end no fault divorce because they hate that women have rights and can just leave a marriage whenever they want

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/no-fault-divorce-laws-republicans-repeal/675371/

Women in the USA have no legally mandated maternity leave. Literally every other OECD nation does.

To name just a few issues.

>I *am* a feminist, but I am a real feminist

Lol no you're fuckin not bud. Completely uneducated on the topic and have no idea wtf an actual feminist even is. 😂</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The problem is that you have a very ignorant understanding of feminism, or don't understand it at all. Completely uneducated take on your part.

Comes across as purposely disingenuous (nobody is this stupid, they're trolling) and misogynistic.

You literally have to be pretty blind and willfully ignorant if this is your honest opinion.

You don't understand feminism. Straight up. Based on your comment, you seem to be arguing against rad fems (radical Feminists) who are basically just Terfs because nobody is actually a rad fem. If you are you're an idiot.

They are the underwhelming MINORITY that incels use to justify their mysogeny (basically what you did in your comment)

They're constantly propped up as the figureheads of feminism by the right to justify attacking ALL feminism, even though rad fems aren't considered legitimate feminists. -AT ALL-

This ignorance of what actual feminism is, is perpetuated by right wing actors.
This ignorance is what led to gamergate and the popularity of hating on "sjws" in the mid 20 teens

Actual feminism addresses the suffering of BOTH sexes. Calling attention to the culture of toxic masculinity and how men suffer from it, how the patriarchy harms them and promotes a cycle of hatred of men and violence towards women.

Actual feminism promotes FEMINISM literally, as in acting more feminine and that being okay for men. There's tons of intersectionality with the LGBTQ+ community, the black community, and men.

Actual feminism isn't "women's rights" modern feminism is  promoting human rights and human decency with the understanding that our current issues are a result of the problems caused by the patriarchy.

Beyond that, your comment IS objectively ignorant. Woman haven't achieved anything close to equality in the West. They literally just lost their right to healthcare. Women are dying and being imprisoned for their completely natural, biological functions (having miscarriages) in the United States. 

Women with autoimmune diseases like lupus and psoriasis are now banned in certain states from taking the only drugs that alleviate their symptoms (like methotrexate) because they *can* be used as abortifacients (things that cause abortions) even though they're not even pregnant. 

Meanwhile men with the same conditions can take that very same medication with no restrictions for no other reason besides they are men.

There are NO alternative medications. Methotrexate is the ONLY drug capable of treating many autoimmune conditions.

So regardless of your opinions on abortion, women are demonstrably being denied healthcare by a metric EVERYONE agrees on. But I digress.

Abortion is healthcare. That is an objective statement. It is settled science. It is not debatable. 

Until this objective fact is acknowledged by laws and rights, women DO NOT have equality.</div>
