&gt;Reddit has harbored racists as policy for years /u/spez. It has led to battling racism constantly, increased by the kneeling that encompassed Black Lives Matter’s message. We are closing for 24 hours with these requests:

&gt;A reddit policy against bigotry,

&gt;Deplatforming heavy participants in hate subreddits through their main account and alts,

&gt;A way to report subreddits based on the content of their sub, and

&gt;If these cannot be met, we call for the resignation of Reddit leadership.

&gt;Thank you

How fucking insufferable these bleeding hearts are.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I made a couple of slight edits so your post might need a few additions, but I have zero opinion of those forums. Never been on them and only just learned that freeper and conservativesforum existed when you brougth them up. Like I said, if you know what you're getting into and a forum named conservatives forum or ar15 is pretty clear, then it's an echo chamber anyway. If the forum was called FairPolitics or just Politics and they censored the left or the right, then it's a problem. Even if the forum was called ToyCarCollectors.com and they banned talk about hotwheels, it's awfully petty of me, but I'd have an issue.

I also said divisive, not diverse. Which appears to be what you agree with, based on your statement.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I hate that the company reddit (do we make it capital R in Reddit or stylized lowercase r for the name?) censors. Large, social companies should not pick sides when it comes to something like politics. I don't care if a sub does, to me, subs are made to be small pockets of echo chambers. I also dislike those subs that outwardly present as neutral which censor valid ideas that do not follow their agenda. 

If you see T_D, just by name alone you know it isn't going to be friendly to **a lot** of ideas, it's going to be divisive, and it's probably going to be all sorts of terrible, that's just the nature of Trump and his biggest supporters, but if you see a sub like Politics or World News, then they should present unbiased and uncensored politics and news, when they do not. 

I would probably fall on the center-left in terms of political/moral compass, when I was much more liberal years ago, so I guess I could lump myself in the trends that I see. It's less about supporting TD and more about me having my most tepid and petty protest against the company.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">reddit really only has a small, small piece of the US population. I don't think this is going to be the big push, but the general censorship attitude of multiple websites and media outlets is certainly piling up straws for people that were on the fence. And the lack of censorship when it's against straight, white males/people.

There was a post a few days ago that hit the front page showing there's been a 2 year trend in decreasing acceptance of far left LGBTQ. I have every reason to believe that that is a symptom of the socio-political pendulum swinging back, from the left, towards the center and then further right. People are more active now and noticing agendas being pushed and getting tired of it. 

Even online, there's less reporting of violence involving law enforcement when that was plastered everywhere from 2010 on to 2016-2017. Trump being elected was absolutely a response to the pendulum swinging, whether you like him or not, he is the Republican president of the United States of America and there are quite a few other trends I notice that I can almost guarantee that the next president will either be a Republican or a center-right Democrat. I'll bet **$**100 on that.

I realize that subbing to T_D is going to auto-ban me from a ton of other subs, even if I never post on it, but now I'm subbing purely to spite the censorship.</div>

From the OPs history, he doesn't deny the holocaust. He just doesn't accept the stats we were given because private investigations into other genocides shows worse numbers than what governments show. He doesn't trust the information to be all honest. 

I also can't tell, but he looks like he doesn't like Jewish people despite actually being Jewish.</div>
