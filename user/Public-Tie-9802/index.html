Looks like a Reddit search for Eglin Air Force base also pulls up people talking about it..

I’ve also heard from a number of sources that many mods on worldnews are not exactly civilians…. But haven’t verified that.</div>

The troops there were using Reddit to manipulate public perception through social media. Reddit scrubbed all mention off it, but screenshots are still on the internet.

I don’t think it is liberal vs conservative as much as mods have all the power and there are definitely mods in key subs who push certain mainstream agendas. Anything Pro trump, anti vaccine, questioning covid, questioning anything trans or other topics will almost always be censored and likely result in a ban.</div>

You really seem to have zero interest in actual facts or history.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It isn’t what I ‘feel’, it’t reality based on fact.

Pro israel groups flood media with comments about ‘Hamas firing thousands of rockets into israel’ yet fail to discuss actions of israel which prompted the response by Hamas - last year’s attacks on Al Aqsa and evictions in Sheik Jarrah are prime examples.  

Similarly IDF a cure every Palestinian they murder as being a ‘terrorist’ yet never prove anything.smevwith their bogus claims of ‘firing from hospitals’. Meanwhile in the2014 slaughter of Gaza israel targeted and destroyed multiple hospitals and other vital infrastructure.  IDF routinely murder journalists and fire at ambulances while preventing ambulances from tending to the people they just shot.

This isn’t the forum to go into detail, but feel free to post on israel_palestine for a more full discussion if you are really interested.</div>

The thread I was posting on was pretty obviously done to push an agenda.

Many people committed and the op went down the responses going after people in the comments.

I responded to one of his comment threads and part way trying to respond I suddenly was not able to respond.

I noticed the top comment of the thread had been deleted by moderators, as well as the specific comment I had responded to, so I thought that was the reason.’

Later I kept getting notifications that others were responding to my comments, but I could still not reply.

The next day the post was removed by the mods for breaking the sub rules and being in the wrong sub.
(Of course at that point nobody could respond).</div>

I’m fine for legitimate discussions, but that includes pointing out misinformation.

Didn’t mean YOU were propagandistic, which is why I specified that I was talking about the portrayal of Hamas.

Sorry if I was blunt and it sounded like a personal attack.

After you hear the same miss characterizations, that you know are false, being intentionally repeated over and over by one side or another and it gets challenging to not be blunt…</div>

It’s way more than SJWing.

Forget about questioning trans ideology, even saying maybe children should be deciding they need elective surgery on their genitalia. 

Forget about pointing out that while Russia isn’t Good, Ukraine isn’t necessarily innocent of all wrongdoing either.

There are specific opinions beyond SJWing that they do not tolerate being questioned.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Funny, you seem to be only focused on responding to extremely bigoted descriptions of Palestinians as terrorists to use their babies to attack innocent Jews as being abrasive, but not the ones who make such bigoted comments in the first place. 

Maybe check your inherent bias?

And for reference, one sub I was banned on (run by Zionists) banned by for ‘misinformation’ and then for not agreeing with the moderators when I countered the often repeated claim that Palestinians started the war by pointing out that large scale military assaults were began by Zionists the same week the British withdrew and that israel wasn’t ’immediately attacked by ‘five neighboring countries’, but in reality Zionists had been massacring local Palestinians for months before neighboring nations got involved. 

The Deir Yassin massacre is perfect evidence of this timeline.

I keep it very factual.

Yet on the other side the pro israel group routinely calls all Palestinians ‘terrorists’ who are innately violence and want to kill all Jews. 

The pro israel bias and anti Palestinian hate speech is common.  


There are multiple reports across Reddit of people being accused by worldnews of ‘terrorist apologia’ for criticizing israel.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I would have answered earlier but after being harassed by the other user who harassed me repeatedly here and across multiple others subs, I got banned from Reddit for seven days, without reason or example of any posts I made.

So yes, the pro israel groups absolutely work to control the public perception and the media. 

Broadly speaking many Reddit groups control the public perception and narrative of their subs based on their own agendas. 

Regarding israel specifically, israel literally has groups line the Hasbara fellowship which they spend millions of dollars on every year to organize and train students, religious groups and their soldiers to monitor social media and control public perception via flooding their comments sections with pro israel posts, attacking and banning other posters who are criticizing israel and becoming moderators. 

Feel free to research “Hasbara”. It isn’t a secret, they have their on Facebook page. 

I requested multiple times for the Reddit admins to tell me why I was banned for a week and never received a reply. 

The only posts I had made prior to the ban were in response to the user here calling me a nazi and harassing me across multiple subs. 

I think that is evidence in itself.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Sorry, but I have to counter your characterization of the israel-Palestine issue. 

The narrative on thus has been dominated by the US and israel up until social media allowed locals and local journalists to tell their own story (this happened around 2014 when israel slaughtered 2200 Palestinians in Gaza over 50 days).

It hasn’t been ‘thousands of years of fighting’. The fighting began when the Zionist movement began systematically taking over the land and expelling its residents in the 1890s. 

And your portrayal of Palestinians as throwing babies, suicide bombers and using civilian places as launching sites is pure Zionist propaganda. 

Palestinians have been denied 99% of building permits since the 1970s by israel, so israel routinely destroyed and structures built by Palestinians (including their homes) for being built without a permit. At the same time settlers and Israelis have been permitted to build wherever and whenever they like. 

Please speak accurately.</div>

So cute you think your name calling scores you any points. 

How many troll accounts do you have to burn through to online harass people?

You should seek mental health treatment and maybe get a hobby. 

Again, I only bother responding to you because you really are a perfect example of a pro israel troll. 

Fake account. Immature. Instant name calling. Incapable of actually discussing any relevant issues. 

You’ll troll until your account is banned then you’ll make another account and do it again. 

Really a sad life.  But hey, most Zionists are sad, weak little people, so you’re nothing special there. 

Enjoy your trolling!

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are definitely right. The problem is that Reddit falsely portrays itself as an open forum without being honest that it facilitates misinformation and propaganda while actively silencing certain viewpoints. 

It should be forced to be one or the other. 

It is one thing if the bias of a sub is inherent in the title and description, but so many subs are dishonest about their purpose and moderation. 

I’m fine with biased subs being biased, but a sub that represents itself as a news sub, and facilitates discussion about the news, shouldn’t be allowed to misrepresent its actual censorship and manipulation of public discourse.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Have you seen the Zionist here openly harassing me because I posted that there is censorship and manipulation on behalf of israel?

They have harassed me across three different subs. Their account is a one day old burner account and they have done nothing but post personal insults no pro israel propaganda. 

I see posts line that all the time with zero recourse. 

Yet I and others have been immediately banned for responding to them calmly with verifiable facts. 

This is just a perfect example.</div>

Have fun with your burner account until it’s banned and you make a new one. 

You only prove what resorts israel has to stoop to in order to spread its propaganda.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Thanks. This is a subject I follow and people are free to have opposing opinions, but I have been surprised at how every major group on Reddit that supposedly exists for ‘news’ is actually heavily censoring any criticism of israel and manipulating public perception through only allowing one viewpoint in the comments. 

I have no doubt that this level of censorship happens on many other subjects, but like anything, one only becomes aware of it when it effects someone directly or is experienced.</div>

I’ll happily let others speak for themselves for they chose.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Actually that’s rapidly changing. That is the perception though, since social media is manipulated (through bans allowing pro israel comments dominating the comments sections and posting biased stories). 

When israel was formally declared an Apartheid government, worldnews and others took down almost every post about it. 

Plus israel organizes groups to troll social media 24 hours per day and get Zionists as mods.</div>
