        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I hope EPIC fails miserably across the world.  They agreed to Apple's TOS when it came to developing their apps.  They chose to use them.  THEN they choice to try and cut Apple out 100% by having their own inapp purchases so that they get to keep 100% of the proceeds.   Apple did try to give them a sweetheart deal but Epic refused it and said they wanted it all.  Period.   This isn't about side-loading it is about can developers create their own store to purchase content for their games / apps without paying Apple.

It should be a hell no.   Apple made it all possible, setting up the infrastructure and made it available to all developers to make money and still give Apple their cut.   No developer should be allowed to bypass that.  It cost Apple billions to develop, to get it to market, and to maintain it; why should they be cut out of the loop when it comes to pricing?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The problem is that most people who are competent are not the problem.   But Apple has built their system (the iOS specifically) for people who don't know or don't really want to learn or tweak or change their phones, they just want them to pick up and work.  There are two types of these people.  Those who don't want to be bothered, and never do anything special with their OS but are technical enough.   The second set are those who are not technical at all, have no desire to be, and are generally inept at any level of debug / fixing.   Sadly, there is a HUGE population of the last type.   Anyone born before 1990 could fall into this category and the further back you go, the ore technically illiterate you are (as in terms of the population not the individual).   Also there are still those who just don't want to learn who were born later.

This is where a walled garden really helps these people.  It protects them from themselves.   For those who don't remember OS 6 & 7 for the Mac, or Windows 3 and '95....   It was a nightmare with viruses and malware everywhere, and it was very easy to install without knowing what you were doing.   And in many cases that was BEFORE the internet was so popular.  Now imagine if Apple opens the door to let any application install, from anywhere.   You're going to have websites with hidden buttons to install malware on these phones that people click on without paying attention or other deceptive advertisements.   Even if there is a security popup, the vast majority will just click accept and keep on going.

Now what will happen when these phones are bricked, their battery life dies, or is held by ransomeware?   Who do you think these people are going to A) turn too, and B) blame?  The answer is Apple.  Remember these are NOT the technical people, they don't know anything but the name written on the phone.  Then they see the big Apple store sign and walk in and say fix this thing that I broke.   Apple either will turn them away, or charge them a bunch of money; and they will scream and yell and bitch to everyone they can that Apple sucks.    

So this will swamp Apple support, costing them a lot of money, and it will make their name look bad.   There is NOTHING positive about this for Apple.   People who are technical and know the OS and chose to use Apple BECAUSE of the walled garden aren't the problem, they know what they are getting into (for the record, this is me, I just don't want to be bothered with it, I have too many other things to do), they aren't the problem, because generally even if they let their wall down, these people will still follow standard safety practices.   

One might say that Android has the same problems; which, it does..  BUT here is the difference. Someone buys a Samsung phone and something goes wrong, what do they do?   Where do they turn too?  There aren't Samsung stores all around the world like the Apple stores, they can't go in and expect it to be fixed.  Either they need someone to fix it for them, like Best Buy, or they don't even know they have a problem, or they just live with it.   Often they do bitch about it, lots of Android problems are 3rd party based and people do bitch about their phones.  Also, they often jump from one brand to another, Samsung, Google, LG,  Huawei, HTC, etc.... thinking that one will fix their problems that the previous one didn't have.  When in reality all they are really buying is a wiped OS and starting over.

People here, and on other websites, often forget two things.  First is how nefarious hackers / marketing / website developers are at tricking people to install things.   And two how, well, stupid, the average person is, the vast majority get lost doing so many everyday tasks (just yesterday was flabbergasted as how many people can't understand the metric system . . . not like it is hard at all!).  

People need to be protected from themselves, quite a bit.   Many of the laws are out there to protect us from us.   This really isn't any different.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They have had the App Store for a long time, and it is really, really dead.   There is no real reason for it.   People can just go buy them from the website of the author directly.   Unless MS puts something special behind the OS, something that make it so much better for developers, I'm afraid you're right.  Basic apps will remain, same ones will be updated to support the new OS and life will go on just the same.   

Really see little need in the upgrade, a lot of businesses still haven't adopted windows 10 yet.</div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Here is what they reviled at their big reveal

* 0-60 in 4.4s
* 563HP (with extended battery)
* 775lbft torque (with extended battery)
* 300 mile range (with extended battery)
* 10,000 towing capability (with extended battery)
* 2000lb carrying capacity (with extended battery)
* Something like 20 power outlets around the vehicle
* Can power most things in your house for 3 days
* $40k base model, $50+k for extended battery edition
* $7k government rebate available

What isn't told :
* How far can it tow, Xlb's?  (i.e. if towing 5000lb, is the range reduced from 300 miles to 50?  we have no idea)
* How far can it carry Xlbs?
* What is the fully loaded price?

I guess time will tell, waiting for the first reviews isn't a bad idea.   Plus the CyberTruck will be out about that time, and the Electric Silverado, and a slew of competition including the new comer Riven.</div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Not really unexpected, especially since Intel really didn't offer huge performances with their last generation.  My guess is that they realized that they screwed up and are working hard and fast to get the next gen out ASAP.  Will it beat the Zen3 or be on part with it?   Donno yet, maybe.   In the last few years the processors really haven't been that much more powerful and it seems like they are running out of ideas.   Start throwing more cores in there, is that next?   Not sure; unfortunately there is only so much you can do to optimize pipelines and push the technology.    

In the 90's you were stupid to buy top of the line, processors were changing so fast it was almost out dated faster than you could put together a machine.   00's was a bit better, but there was always that sweet spot of buying higher end, but not too high.   10's it was more of buying the high end if you can, and let it run for 5 to 8 years and then do it again.   I predict that we'll see in the 20's, that most of the lower end processors won't be used nearly as much, people will all gravitate toward the high end and keep those machines for 5 to 10 years.   If Intel and AMD focused on keeping the price of the high end processors down a bit, it can really drive this and move many people to these processors.   If they keep the high end processors much higher, then it will hurt this prediction, but it seems like it would be in their interest to get more people on one or two processors instead of having 5 to 10 different ones.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It really isn't what it says it is.  Basically it is just using the plastic enclosure, everything else is replaced.   You'd think at least it is using the display, it isn't.   The processor is external, basically any computer.   They pushed a small OLED display into the plastic housing and are controlling it with another processor.  It is small display, black and white, and very low res.  Cool idea, but not really the same if it isn't running on the hardware supplied by the device.</div>
