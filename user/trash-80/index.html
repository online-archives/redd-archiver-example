    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">oh dude, yes seriously, I had to ragequit watching television that's how angry I was!! Stephen Cold-turdt made me so incensed that now I can't even leave my house because l'm incapable of interacting with the public due to my intense anger issues. I promised myself that I would never watch television again but I was so tempted that l tried a workaround and looked up some highlight video clips of Cold-turdt on my phone. Needless to say, that just made me lose it harder than ever. I broke my phone into a million pieces with a ball peen hammer. This is proving to be quite perilous because a food supply will eventually run out and now I can't order takeout food! There is a very large spare fridge in the garage that I keep my Costco bulk frozen food items in, like neapolitan ice cream, mini vienna franks, hot pockets and such, and that will sustain a person for awhile, but alas this only a stop gap measure that won't work in the long term. My mother had stepped in to rescue me to a degree by bringing over care packages and my clean laundry. However that all ended when she told me that she didn't think that my hatred for Cold-turdt was a justifiable reason to behave the way I have. I SNAPPED! I'm talking I have the power of greyskull and rhythm is a dancer level of SNAP! It's getting kind of hectic when Cold-turdt can turn even your own mother goes against you. What else do you have left after that??? So you know what I did?? I snatched the heavily tin-foil covered plate of chicken tenders she had made for me right out of her hand and put it into the microwave! And I proceeded to set the timer to 77 minutes and 77 seconds, pushed the start button, AND I TURNED MY BACK AND SLOW WALKED AWAY. 

My house burned down as result and I was killed by smoke inhalation. A brilliant scientist lived next door to me, discovered what had happened, and he took advantage of the opportunity of a free untraceable corpse. He re-animated me by shooting me up with 77cc's of a special super male vitality formula. Now I'm a kind of Frankenstein monster/ Solomon Grundy person with insanely severe anxiety issues who can get triggered faster than any known snowflake alive. I have won several highly prestigious quick draw triggering competitions like the San Francisco International Celebrity Safe Space Tournament at Yale University To Benefit Hollywood Refugees In Canada Invitational. As we speak I am in the process of being officially recognized by Guinness World Records.I also have super powered shit posting and trolling abilities now, but the drawback is that my whole body is a cerulean green color and the only sound my mouth can make is

The answer is 5%. Let me say that again, **only 5 % !!!** So Ossoff essentially got every cent of his donation money from all over the country, and only got like 8,000 people to donate who are actually real voters and supporters. And the state that sent the most was California. That's a joke. 
##The democrats got their hollywood celebrity puppets to drum up support from the  ENTIRE COUNTRY and the best they could do was roughly 180,000 donators
