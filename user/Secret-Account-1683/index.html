    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;What did the complainers expect? That's obviously a problem. If customers show up and the face of the company isn't there, how are they going to react?

They claimed I was letting other people be late, but it was a question of degrees.  If someone called me and said that they were stuck in traffic, and that they were going to be 10 minutes late - and if that person was late maybe once a month - I let it slide.  If he's 30 minutes to an hour late, twice a week without calling in, it's a problem.

So yes, superficially, I allowed someone to be late and I let it go, but it was about the amount and frequency of his lateness.  But at first they made it about me "failing to motivate him" to show up on time.  In response I made a somewhat smarmy remark about how keeping his job and his work visa should be motivation enough to show up, which then got me branded as being an insensitive racist, despite the fact that I'm also on a work visa myself.

The thing is that many people in HR also selectively enforced rules.  For example, you were supposed to swipe in at check-in point closest to your physical desk, and not the one next to the underground parking garage where you enter the building.  But I knew people who got written up for it, while others did not.

&gt;I just checked, and noticed the absence of any such rule. But I'm guessing that there was one right after the intervention? I saw an admin play that game on another site - take action, and then edit the rules after the fact.

Yeah, they will claim that they changed it, and then changed it back.  A lot of subs are doing this, or they'll just claim that enforcement is at "moderator discretion" - so that anything can be twisted to mean anything else.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The mods will delete posts if a majority of people don't answer in the right way.

A while back, I posted about a spat with a co-worker who I manage.  Basically, people at my job said I was wrong to write up a colleague, because writing him up would have gotten him fired.  Apparently *that* was bad, according to HR, because he's an "immigrant" and losing his job means losing his work permit.

I explained that it wasn't as dire as people were making it out to be: He's an expat (meaning he's here by choice), he's originally from a first-world country, and he was consistently late in a front-facing position.  As for myself, I'm also a foreigner in this country so it's not like I'm haughty person picking on a "poor immigrant who's just trying to make an honest living".

Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed over there at AITA, and most people said that given the circumstances, I was just doing what I had to do.

Suddenly, the mods intervened and said that I was breaking a rule against posting work-related content.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Any time there is a bigger than usual news event (for example, Russia/Ukraine, Twitter, etc.), I've noticed that a lot of the top posters are 10-year old accounts with just a handful of posts.

Case in point: [https://imgur.com/a/CbjYo4S](https://imgur.com/a/CbjYo4S) (10-year old account which has 4 days of posts).

Wouldn't be surprised if they are actually abandoned accounts which have been bought.  Simply searching for how to do that in google gives you thousands of results - so it isn't impossible. Then we have the whole thing where the most Reddit-"addicted" city is Eglin Air Force Base...</div>

Could be that an admin retroactively applied a ban, but forgot to specify a date.</div>
