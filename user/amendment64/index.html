    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Look, I doubt you'll believe me, but I've got to try to explain this stuff regardless. I'm a biochemist by degree, a medical lab scientist by profession. I live this stuff, both the research side and the medical side. To call this RNA therapy "experimental" is extremely concerning. Its not experimental. RNA therapies have been in development for [decades.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250668/) The first [FDA approved RNA therapies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03068-4) came about way back in 1998. [mRNA vaccines work by introducing a piece of mRNA that corresponds to a viral protein, usually a small piece of a protein found on the virus’s outer membrane. (Individuals who get an mRNA vaccine are not exposed to the virus, nor can they become infected by it.) Using this mRNA blueprint, cells produce the viral protein. As part of a normal immune response, the immune system recognizes that the protein is foreign and produces specialized proteins called antibodies. Antibodies help protect the body against infection by recognizing individual viruses or other pathogens, attaching to them, and marking the pathogens for destruction.  Once produced, antibodies remain in the body, even after the body has rid itself of the pathogen, so that the immune system can quickly respond if exposed again. If a person is exposed to a virus after receiving mRNA vaccination for it, antibodies can quickly recognize it, attach to it, and mark it for destruction before it can cause serious illness.](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/therapy/mrnavaccines/)  I should note, RNA(mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA) is something your body produces all the time to fulfill the myriad functions your body needs to perform to live every single day.  Your body is fully capable of breaking down RNA safely into its constituent parts, and there is absolutely no possibility of it affecting your DNA.  RNA functions to help make proteins, to turn on and off certain genes, to aid in biochemical reactions, and much more.  As for [the other stuff in the vaccines](https://www.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/HealthU/2021/01/11/a-simple-breakdown-of-the-ingredients-in-the-covid-vaccines/);  Its quite literally the same carrier ingredients we've been using in our other vaccines for decades!  Lipids, salts, sugars, and stabilizers to help protect the vaccine from degradation and help carry it to its destination.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this has been informative for you, and I encourage you to ask any questions you may have regarding this stuff.  It worries me to see that a large amount of our populace seems to not have been brought up to speed on modern science, but I sure hope I can do my part and help educate folks!  Empirical study and peer education is the only way we move forward and allow people to feel comfortable with the treatments we have available.  Hope you're having a great day!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Was curious, so I [googled](https://www.healio.com/news/cardiology/20210621/myocarditis-after-covid19-vaccine-treatable-aha-urges-continued-vaccination) it for you.

&gt;In the Circulation publication, researchers documented seven male patients ranging in age from 19 to 39 years who had myocarditis-like symptoms  
 after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine; five received Pfizer/BioNTech’s   
mRNA vaccine, one received Moderna’s mRNA vaccine and one received   
Johnson &amp; Johnson’s non-mRNA vaccine. Treatments varied and included  
 beta-blockers and anti-inflammatory agents, and all patients had their   
symptoms resolved by hospital discharge. The mean hospital length of   
stay was 3 days.   
&gt;  
&gt;In a related press release, the American Heart Association said that the  
myocarditis reports should not dissuade people from getting vaccinated   
against COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The American Heart Association continues to urge all adults and   
children ages 12 and older in the U.S. to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as   
soon as they can, as recommended by the CDC. Research continues to   
indicate that the COVID-19 vaccines are 91% effective at preventing   
severe COVID-19 infection and spreading the virus to others. In   
addition, the benefits of vaccination far exceed the very unusual   
risks,” the AHA said in the release. “According to the CDC, fewer than   
1,000 cases of myocarditis-like illnesses were reported as of May 31,   
2021, and nearly 312 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been   
administered in the U.S. to date.”

Make your own judgements on the report, personally 1000 cases in 312 million administered doesn't sound very concerning to me.  

An interesting note by the researchers of this study to also include;

&gt;Additional study is needed to confirm if the rate of myocarditis-like   
illness is higher after vaccination than the background rate of   
myocarditis among similar-aged individuals in the population.”

So, these could even be usual background cases completely unrelated to vaccine administration.  None of this changes the fact that r/pics shouldn't have banned you, but your premise is somewhat vapid and is literally cherry picking from what the authors of the study concluded</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I haven't bothered.  I just moved on.  Not exactly noble, but its less of a loss than I originally worried about.  Honestly, I value the opinion of reddit a lot less these days, and for good reason.  For too long I put reddit on a pedestal above other social media outlets, not critically reviewing its content as biased just like all the other media content I consume.  But reddit is incredibly biased, just as all media outlets.  I have to get my news from many varied sources, not just reddit(despite it being a supposed news aggregate site, it is not so much anymore.  Its become a vapid echo chamber, devoid of real thoughtful discussion).  If groups wish to remove me without justifiable cause, then they expose their biases as extremist and I must label their platform as such.  I'm basically just here for video game and table top memes these days.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; Trump did create the virus? 

No.  The virus is a virus.  They occur naturally.  Nobody "created" it, it created itself.  

&gt; The virus is not Chinese? 

It is not.  The virus has no nationality.  Though speculation and early signs point to it having emerged first in an area in China, the virus itself has no nationality.  It has a name(Covid-19 or  SARS-CoV-2 or novel Coronavirus).  The majority of people already uses those names in liu of "Chinese virus" because that name is deliberately inflammatory, attempting to use language to pin the virus on the Chinese people and stoke anger and resentment towards the Chinese.  If you are using it because you would like to denote regionality, as we have seen with the Spanish flu or Zika Virus, it would probably be slightly more honest to call it the  Wuhan Coronavirus, though imo its still an unnecessary delineation.  The Chinese government is undeniably a totalitarian regime responsible for reprehensible crimes against humanity, but that is no reason to stoke a xenophobic mentality against Chinese people in general.</div>
