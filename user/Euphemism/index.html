They got the NPC moniker because they are so entirely predictable. 

Not that I am suggesting you break the rules or anything, but it seems to me that when one side flouts the rules, makes them up on the spot and biasly enforces them - that means there are no rules, and there is absolutely not a single reason any user on this platform should give a rats ass about what the mod's say, or the admins, or anyone... I couldn't blame anyone from making dozens of alts, using proxy's, spamming the fuck out of whatever subreddit, heck - if the admins allow AHS to post child porn to subreddit to try and get them shutdown(The reason why WRD is so fucked) then it is clear that anything goes and I see no reason why it shouldn't be dealt back to them. 

If someone wanted to fight you and you both agreed to boxing rules, and then the person kicked you between the legs, you wouldn't continue merely boxing would you? Of course not, you'd stomp them in the grapes as much as you could for payback. I see no difference here.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Not really when you look at it from their side. I have been around for a LONG time, so let me give you my insight of how they all seem to work .

They spend a lot of time making sure the narrative is true for the masters. I can't speak for vancouver, but for Toronto it has gone something like this:

The mods, all crazed leftists, have worked hard to make sure that the sub is essentially a mirror of opinion from the Star and the CBC. Several users, will actually work for the rags themselves and are tight with the mod's. Whether there is any quid-pro-quo I don't know, but the mod's make sure that the narrative being pushed by those rags gets repeated and repeated in their sub. 

 At first, the M.O of them would be to simply attack any poster that goes against the narrative or pokes holes through it. First they will mass downvote you, this is for two reasons, 1 - get you beneath the limit for being able to freely post(a way of slowing you down from speaking) and 2 - discourage you from speaking such things.

 If you persist in "wrong think" and haven't be discouraged despite having to wait 10 minutes to reply then they would slip to method two. You'd still get downvoted past the viewing limit, but now there will be some people that will actually respond to you and ask you questions about your P.O.V(instead of the name calling during the first step). This is to keep you engaged in the hidden thread, 6 questions to you can keep you busy for a full hour and again hopefully get you discouraged from continuing in the thread because it is just a waste of time. 

Finally, assuming you stayed the course and didn't get discouraged, and continued your "wrong think" ways then you will find some "random poster" that hasn't been involved the entire thread suddenly shows up and gets VERY abusive towards you, name calling, insults, etc all just trying to get you to return  fire. The second you say anything outside of merely being polite to the person calling you every name in the book, the mod(who was the random poster all along) switches accounts claims you have broken rule 3(being civil) bans you and removes the thread to remove the evidence of who it was. If you message the mod afterwards claiming innocence, or that you didn't say anything nearly as bad, or you were defending yourself you will be muted and ignored. 

The problem here is that it didn't stop people from making other alt account's, or new posters coming from other subs, or even just new posters thinking they were in a legitimate discussion. As the mod's cracked down on "wrong think" they pissed more and more people off and had to do the above more and more and it become blatantly obvious the entire process, not to mention the process took a long time which exposed the mod's alt account to others. So they went to the newer version of it.. 

 The new version is to just filter all new users. If your first couple of posts are in agreement with the narrative - the filter gets lifted and away you go.

 If not, then the filter remains. If you inquire why your posts are stuck at 1 and you can't see them when not logged in, they will either tell you what they did(you have to stay in filter purgatory until you give up and go away) or they will then claim you are avoiding a ban and ban you immediately for it. If you try and discuss with them, or defend yourself or prove they are wrong, or ask for any evidence of their claims they will mute you for 72 hours... 

Sorry for the long post, but the amount of censorship that happens on reddit isn't something that can be explained in a couple of lines. 

Also sorry that you got banned, but really there was little lost on your side. MetaCanada is the only real Canadian sub anyway even if the mods there canbe shits, they are at least honest shits which is more than I can say for the other subs.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">All Canadian city subs are like this. The mod's have lost their damn minds, because the narrative they have been told to craft falls apart at the first sign of inspection. The users, generally, have no idea that the mod's think they are useless shits and can't defend the narrative, so the mod's create these idiotic rules to protect the narrative.

The rule "To make sure you aren't a troll", can be more accurately stated as "To make sure you aren't going to go against the narrative, and cause our users to start thinking for themselves and questioning things"</div>

I honestly, and sincerely hope and pray that the people pushing these censorships realize how this ends. How the only way this ends.  I suspect long before the 90% of people are willing to be silenced and shackled or else they be "removed" they decide it is the 10% that need to be removed. 

I think a vast majority of us - first allies - that believed "live and let live" as the premise for fighting for homosexual rights, are looking around now and wondering where it all went so horribly wrong.</div>

Not that anyone needs me to point it out, but.... 

If the rules aren't applied equally, if indeed the breaking of the rules are allowed, promoted and accepted depending on who is doing it - Then, there are no rules, and anyone that follows them are merely tying their own hands, censoring themselves, etc under the misplaced respect for the platform or what it claims to stand for. 

Make as many alt's as you like, because why not? 

Break as many of the rules as you like, because why not? 

Be as racists, sexist, rude, disgusting as you like, because why not? 

The great thing about this is that they have removed any shackles from posting guidelines.</div>

You can literally be banned from r/toronto for saying that refugee's have to go home once their home country is safe. They banned one person I knew within 30 minutes. The reason? They thought she was an alt. No evidence, didn't break any rules - just banned, because. 

Meanwhile they have a rule about religious intolerance, and any thread regarding the recent opening of Chick-Fil-A was post after post of Christian bashing.</div>

The weekly numbers in each of those subs is greater than the entirity of any of the banned subbreddits. 

I am sure it is just an oversight though, like the admins haven't gotten around to seeing the posts cataloguing them at shitpoliticssays and shitstatistssay

right? I mean, the only other explanation is the admins here are cool with breaking rules as long as it goes against the right-wing.</div>

r.metacanada user has a listing of about(I think) +200 users that have been banned from r/canada and surprise, surprise they are all conservative. 

I don't think there was anyone that actual compiled a list for r/ontario, but just prior to the election(Where Doug Fucking Ford was put in place by the sensible people of Ontario), there was mass banning from r/ontario towards anyone that defended him, promoted him or just didn't think he was the devil. 

r/toronto has banned so many people there was even a r/torontorevolt subreddit. They have been caught changing their rules to cover for their favourites. The mods have been caught hanging out in known brigading subs. Point this out, and they ban you. When you ask why they say you are an alt and mute you. 

I would love to hear any other stories of bad politically motivated moderation in subreddits that shouldn't be based on politics(country, state/province, city). </div>

The problem is that after 2 years of attacking everyone that wasn't part of their group, any individual that does see through this BS, will also be very aware that their group will turn on them in a second and their entire reputation will be spun into them being a racist, sexist, xenophobic russian troll. They know this, because they have done this to everyone that woke up before now.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Exactly. It seems so heavy handed I almost think that information could come out to really reverse the narrative. Recall they did the same thing with the Pulse NightClub attack. When it first happened it was all over, every sub, everywhere.. then they find out that it was a muslim that did it and just like that it was censored and removed. 


Im obviously not saying a muslim did this, but I am saying that when the crafted narrative shows cracks the entire thing falls down. They aren't appearing to allow any cracks to even form this time around.</div>

That said, I recall in the lead up to the 08 election the Obama campaign gamed this site pretty hard, and everyone that spoke out about it or proved their was monkey business going on were silenced/banned pretty quick by the new reddit leadership.

I'd tell them I told you so, but that entire ban, and I am pretty sure they don't care and probably actively support those doing it. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That wasn't my experience, but I only recently found it when I started noticing the censorship being ratcheted up to 11 around here. It is especially sad seeing that freedom of speech(even, nay, especially odious speech) was supposed to be allowed. Better to have the people out in the day light where you can see them, engage with them, discuss things with them and hopfully change their minds - than in the shadows where they breed, their ideas go unchecked and to every outside appearance looks like they are being censored because people fear what they have to say/are correct. </div>

This is clearly yet another example of one sided moderation, and someone being censored due to political leanings. 

State that Harper was a bad signer - upvoted to the moon. Call him a sweater-vest wearing bozo, and you are an enlightened soul. Call Mike Harris evil and you are a mod on r/Ontario, state that between McGuinty and Wynne Ontario is effectively bankrupted and you'll comment will be removed for being anti-lgbt. 

Trudeau, like his idiot father before him, has done such harm to the country that it would take decades to repair it, if it is even possible to repair it. All thanks to SJW's, and if SJW's don't like being called SJW's, then maybe they should be in better control of their emotions. However, if they could do that they wouldn't be SJW's in the first place.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I have watched it happen in several different subreddits. Usually what happens is some people will say stuff that goes with the narrative. All upvoting each other.

 Then, a few others come along and argue against the narrative. They of course get downvoted to oblivion as they lack the numbers of the original crew, but soon more and more people join and the up/down votes become more equalized. 

Once that happens the mod's lock the thread, delete a bunch of posts that were against the narrative citing "rule X"(whether they were or not) and then claim they had to lock the thread because of the alt-right.. It happens so often it is practical a meme at this stage. 

r/toronto goes even further. They claim right off the bat that it will be a controversial thread and thus will only allow those with significant r/toronto posting histories allowed(What they classify as significant is never defined) and then run through pro-actively removing any post that goes against the narrative, banning people along the way.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; What about the ones serving who have seen combat, are trusted by their teams, and have higher ranks commending their hard work. I suppose their dedication, hard work and sacrifice for our country means jack shit to you?

 - Be careful with matches with those strawmen you are working with. Lets see, do we sacriface and endanger 99% of service men and women, so we can make sure u/WTFppl feels better, or do we remove 1% of the service men-&gt;women and vise versa so that the vast, VAST majority of people are in a better, safer, and more productive situation. ... HMMMM??? What a hard choice. 

&gt;If we are going to say that we have to weed out this mental illness from the military, then we must also weed out the sociopaths, psychopaths and anyone who would want to be a career killer. Because wanting to kill is a mental illness.

 - Unless the job is to, you know, kill. Which, not to make your head spin is precisely the job requirement for the military. How is anyone this dense?  Also, AFAIK, they do weed those people out as well, and they also weed out people with shin-splits and flat feet.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I think that has widely been known, and accepted, within the medical establishment for years now. Simply put, when what you think you are, and what you observably are - are at odds, there is a mental issue. If you think you are a cat, and are clearly a human - there is a mental issue. If you think you are a female, but can't help but notice your penis staring at you - then there is a mental issue. This isn't to say they don't deserve compassion, treatment, help or are in anyway less human - but they aren't fit for military work either. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Exactly this. I got banned from a sub for merely pointing out that the people in there should actually go to r/the_donald instead of listening to the people telling them it is filled with racism and sexism and stuff. I mean, I can understand how it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly isn't the way the reddit narrative has been telling people. 

Of course telling people not to trust reddit, on reddit, probably isn't the smartest thing either. Especially since you can be banned from subs you haven't even visited for commenting there, the reddit admins allow doxing of its users, the reddit admins have gone back and edited comments(going against their own rules), and the list goes on and on.. But I'll be damned if r/the_donald isn't the closest thing to what reddit was back when I joined.

Doing one thing, because you know the opponent is going to do something you want them to do because it sets up your next move. Thinking several moves in advance type of thing. Boxers and fighters do it all the time. 

For strange on r/the_donald I would go with the reverence for a frog more than 4d chess. </div>
