    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Exactly! That’s my main concern is that whatever lifestyle is considered acceptable is based on the group in power. I was raised Christian fundamentalist (I don’t go anymore) and they were very intolerant of a diversity of thought and lifestyle. We did some good stuff, I was working in the slums of Mexico building houses (which has made me grateful for my life and privilege, and I’ll never forget how easy I have it) when I was a little kid, so there’s good aspects and negative to any group or belief or ideology. 

That’s my fundamental problem with what seems like identity politics, like I’m a gym bro and have had girls say “based on your appearance, I’m surprised you read books like that, or I’m surprised you are so sweet, etc”. And most of the guys at my gym do fit the opposite narrative, so sometimes stereotypes are right, sometimes not. 

I think I get your concern now in a new way, I hadn’t realized what could happen in Florida if thing’s progressed, and how it might look in 15 years. It’s not just the laws in place right now, it’s what they might do next year, or in 5 years. Same with the stuff Lori Lightfoot did with Covid. What will the government do next time? What if there’s the state monopoly on violence behind those rules or laws? We need to be able to decide for ourselves</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Agreed, I don’t think it would be appropriate to do that either. I think the reason my sister is claiming to be NB is because she’s in her late 40s, she’s bored and desperate for attention, I’m 40, and there’s a lot of stuff that I’m “too old for”. If I go to bars with my friends, despite that I’m somewhat attractive for a guy my age, I have all my hair and I’m in pretty great shape, most of the super attractive 25 year olds wouldn’t want to date me, they wouldn’t want to hang out with me, etc.

I have to accept that aspects of life have passed me by. My older sister has always been abusive and narcissistic, and I personally think she’s co-opting trans identity as a way of getting more attention and controlling people. I wish there was an option to stop grifters.

There’s a lot of trans/NB people in my city. A girl I was good friends with and dated/slept with who I adore became NB and I think it’s a phase, but I respect her so much that I’ll happily use whatever pronouns she wants. It doesn’t affect me, but it affects her so I’ll happily help out so she can feel safe and happy. If I see a trans person at my coffee shop, I know it’s a person having a human experience and probably struggling, and I’ll act like a decent human being because that’s what they need right now. 

And I agree with case by case basis. I get frequently criticized for being white and male (I couldn’t choose either of those) or privileged (I got beaten constantly as a kid, which isn’t particularly privileged). I don’t need anyone to say sorry for that, I’m glad I had a traumatic childhood, because it helps me be more empathetic with others, and to protect them. I wish more people were like you and tried to view everyone as an individual regardless of their situation.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My older sister claims to be nonbinary, yet feels inclined to scream at people for not knowing her pronouns even if she’s never told them before. She looks female. She is female. My nephew, her son, routinely gets beaten by her and she makes excuses for it. I do not care at all about respecting the gender identity of someone who abuses children.

Her identity is for her, I can think whatever I want, if I don’t agree with the fact she’s “they/them” that’s my choice. If she acted reasonably, or hadn’t yelled at me for misgendering her when she had NEVER told me her pronouns prior or that she had even became nonbinary, I’d be willing to be respectful. But I’m not going to be forced into anything. 

If I see someone who’s clearly male on the street, but wearing womens clothes, I’ll assume they are trans. I will be respectful meeting anyone the 1st time, if they act like an asshole, I’ll respond like an asshole. I’ve been groped without consent dozens of times by trans people (mostly Hispanic) at gay bars. Sexual assault isn’t cool, or funny. I do not give a fuck what they claim to be, it’s a Mexican dude in a dress with fake tits who’s a rapist, fuck their pronouns. 

This is the inherent problem with self ID. I’m not going to respect shitty people, and it doesn’t matter if they think they are trans. I get to form my own opinions, as does everyone else. They don’t get to force their self perception on others.</div>

You don’t even understand basic stuff like defending your opponents argument. All you’d need to say is “there’s a lot of abject poverty in the US and I also find it difficult that some people on the left are so out of touch with what the Midwest is like”. Unless you’ve never been. And driven through towns with 400 people where there is nothing. No jobs, no resources, just poverty and drug abuse and zero hope.

I went there because I knew I was probably wrong. Maybe some of these people I was told I had to hate might not actually be as bad as you all said. Maybe they are just poor and don’t have the same advantages I did.</div>

It seems to be common enough that I’m more likely to be sexually assaulted by a trans person then a straight man… so I know who the real enemy is. The people committing the sexual assault.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I know a VAST amount of idiots who think all guns should be banned because nobody should have access to automatic rifles. They have no idea automatic rifles have been banned from civilian ownership since 1930. 

They think ARs have zero value, and are responsible for every mass shooting. Also wildly inaccurate. They refuse to actually understand the things they are talking about.

I’ve asked people who say “obesity isn’t a choice” if they know the caloric difference between a gram of fat vs a carb. I’ve asked if they know that PPL means, or how hypertrophy works. They have zero understanding of basic nutrition, zero understanding of muscle structure and how calories work, yet they KNOW nobody can lose weight, but they can’t explain how people build muscle, which is a very basic concept. 

Most people in Seattle are insane. There are constantly fat people wearing masks outside, there has never been any evidence of outdoor transmission. They have wildly contradictory opinions and beliefs and engage in a cult like following and adherence. I’ve seen friends talking about the “how great and important Ghostbusters was” that had never seen the movie, but they knew it was pro-woman, so they have to defend it, that’s why grifters like Kendi or Robin DeAngelo have so much money, because it’s so fucking easy to take advantage of woke liberals. Just say “I’ll help you solve your racism”, give me money. There was that wealthy black woman who was charging people $3k to go to your house, have dinner with you and berate you for your racism. 

https://www.thecut.com/2021/05/eavesdropping-on-race2dinners-anti-racist-dinner-parties.html

Katie Herzog got death threats for writing an article interviewing detransitioners. She got called a Nazi, coffee shops on Capitol Hill wouldn’t serve her because she had the audacity to do interviews with people and listen to their stories. 

The issue I have is that nobody on the left can identify grifters. The men in the UK who self Identified as trans 1 week before sentencing are obviously lying, but because you “can’t question anyone’s identity” they get a pass. You aren’t allowed to question whether any trans person is authentic, even though we have stories and evidence of people planning out how to lie for better prison conditions. You can’t call out Kendi or robin, because if they are lying, the whole system implodes. The BLM leadership is a perfect example of how ridiculously easy it is to rip people off. One of my heroes is Fred Hampton, he would probably think a lot of the current obsession with race is backwards. He tried to look past race and focus on class. You guys just want to obsess over what’s the gender pronoun of the day. It’s just narcissism. It’s all narcissism.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">50% of the people who have touched me without consent at gay bars were gay men. The other 50% were trans. I’ve been raped when I was sleeping, by a gay man who I thought was my friend. Most of my friends are gay, I know plenty about the lifestyle. I go to pride parties on a regular basis.

So it seems like a lot of the bad behavior seems to be from your precious LGBTQ community. Unless those trans women, like aren’t real women and they are just gay men wearing a dress, which would make far more sense because I’ve never had a straight girl at a bar grab my junk without consent.

What are trans women before they “self identify as trans?” Typically, Gay men. I’m not gonna respect the identity of someone who thinks they can grab me without consent, I don’t give a shit if “misgendering” harms them, maybe don’t touch people without asking them first. 

Dylan Mulvaney is a narcissistic gay man who is apparently now a “real woman”. Totally. It’s not like there’s literal documentation of Dylan realizing how popular the days of girlhood was then running with it after trying a bunch of other stuff trying to go viral.</div>

I’ve never heard any of my friends talk trash about poor people in the Midwest, people in abject poverty in rural America but I guess you aren’t “punching down” in that case, because even if you live in a trailer park in Ohio, if you are a conservative (god forbid) you are somehow privileged. 

Somehow a white person who works part time at Walmart and survives off food stamps is somehow “more privileged” then my Indian and Asian friends who work at Amazon, live in $3500 apartments or own a 4 bedroom house and have a Tesla.

Covid was the last straw, you all abandoned healthcare is a human right. You played your hand. 

I don’t give a shit what conservatives do, it’s not my problem. Can’t you just ignore them? Didn’t you say that about how i should just ignore the people in my city who said we should be allowed to shoot people without masks? Shouldn’t I just ignore all the trans people who have groped me at gay bars? “They aren’t hurting you, just ignore them”. What has Alex Jones done to personally harm you, just ignore him….</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Not disputing that. Plenty of healthy men died, I think the 20-30 age group was under 1,000 from 2021-2022. 

It’s a deflection to say “lots of healthy men in their 20s died” because lots could be 100,000 or 1,000,000. When I looked at the CDC death rates, the virus was especially dangerous to people over 60. The data backs that up. Covid was highly unlikely to kill you if you were under 40, regardless of the vaccine. And the CDC also buried data on booster effectiveness because “young people already had plenty of protection from the first two shots”. The first booster did almost nothing for our age group, so they hid the data and just used the 50+ data to make the numbers look better. It wasn’t my fault they lied.

People think Covid was deadly to children because 1500 kids died, by the end of 2021. 1500 children is a lot of kids, but is it statistically significant? Does the fact one kid died mean that it’s equally dangerous to every other child? 

Obesity doesn’t just “play a role”. It literally increases spread. This isn’t up for debate, because we already all know obesity increases transmission of influenza, and there are a dozen studies for Covid. One doctor I’ve spoken with that I dated said it’s been grounded research for decades obesity increases virulence.

Because we know obesity increases spread with influenza, and Covid, it’s on the fat people to prove they aren’t a danger to society. It’s not on me to prove they are, because they will never listen. They will never be uncomfortable or go to the gym because they think it’s boring or fatphobic. If fat people think it should be mandatory to get vaccinated, then so is exercise. They don’t get “a pass to spread Covid just because they are fat” because they refused to grant any exemptions to vaccine mandates. They said people should be black listed, fired from their jobs, permanently banned from hospitals and restaurants.</div>

There’s a ton of stuff out there on Kendi. Robin DeAngelo is also a race grifter. People have a profit motive 

Since I’m sure you have strong opinions about Covid, I’m fully vaccinated, and I exercise regularly. I go to the gym. I have abs. I can bench 275. That makes me less likely to spread Covid then an obese person, so why are obese people lying to themselves and us they are passionate about Covid mitigation? If they aren’t exercising, they are lying. And we shouldn’t trust liars.</div>

My main issue has always been that I live in a very white area. I know a lot of white women who have masters degrees, never dated outside their race, and seem like they think it’s their job to tell me what I’m obligated to think.

It’s no different then what I saw when I was forced to go to church when I was a kid. Nonstop lectures about my moral failings and thought police from Christian’s, and a lot of liberals do the exact same thing.

I don’t like Dylan Mulvaney. At all. I think they are really fucking annoying. I hate all influencers. I’m not allowed to dislike Dylan because the reason anyone dislikes them is transphobia, it’s never up to personal preference. That’s the problem. That it’s about control, and some of us fucking hate being told what to do. I’ve dated a guy, most of my friends are gay, I don’t need to be told what to do by people who think they are better then me because they have a degree.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I didn’t date “a Mormon”. I dated a girl who was raised in the Mormon church and had left the church when she was 19. I dated her when she was 29. She had been out of the church for a decade, and just the fact that I said “my girlfriend used to be Mormon” nonstop lectures about how terrible the Mormon church was. How is that her fault, at all? She didn’t even go to church anymore or believe in it. 

The approach is always gonna be “conservatives are worse” which means that you’ll never hold liberals accountable because at least they aren’t conservative. I’ve had a liberal friend say that me bringing up I was raped was the same as saying “all lives matter”. Why am I expected to believe these people are not terrible humans? They are liberal, they hold “the correct opinions” so they can’t be bad people right? 

My issue with Kendi is that he’s a grifter. You are aware that’s not even his real name right? He’s doing it for money, and I can prove that too. He is ripping off white people who feel terrible about their skin color, he’s gotten $40 million to “study racism”. He got cornered at an event when someone asked him if vaccine passports were inherently racist and he said yes. So the same people who are anti racist also think vaccines should be mandatory, which is impossible to be anti racist if you support an inherently racist program. Since Kendi is an expert on racism, we need to trust his judgment. 

On the other hand, plenty of terrible shit that Muslims do, including the fact that my Muslim girlfriend had FGM done to her as a baby, but my social group will NEVER say anything negative about the Muslim faith, or say “that’s shitty that you are dating a Muslim” but people had plenty to say about me dating someone who wasn’t even Mormon anymore. Nobody will criticize Islam because they are terrified of being labeled “an ism”. My first girlfriend was Korean. She wasn’t AAPI. My current girlfriend is West African. She’s not BIPOC. Those are your labels, not mine, but if I don’t comply and use your terms then I’m racist, apparently. 

That’s the issue, that people are hypocritical and not even remotely logical about how and what they will criticize, they have ZERO principles. Obesity increases covid transmission rates, meaning you are more likely to spread Covid if you are obese (and there are dozens of studies about this) but again, no criticism of obese people, plenty of criticism of people who won’t get a booster shot, even if they are athletic or have legitimate concerns about it. Like black people. 

I bring up obesity increases Covid spread because there is vast amounts of scientific evidence that people refuse to accept because it’s worse (apparently) to be fatphobic then to spread Covid and potentially kill someone. And these same people have the “in this house we follow science” signs. What science do they follow, exactly? Clearly not all the science. Not the science that says obesity is unhealthy. Why should I trust them on anything else?</div>

I’ve had people on the left side of my girlfriend is suffering from internalized racism for dating a white guy. I’ve seen people on Reddit called her an Uncle Tom. I’ve gotten more criticism for dating a girl who grew up Mormon but left the church then dating a Muslim girl who thinks BLM is stupid and thinks most trans people are just attention seeking narcissists. The fact all of you got played by Ibrahim X Kendi, the struggle sessions. Most of you are so desperate just to know a black person that you will constantly talk about race to prove that you are racist. I don’t care that my girlfriend is black, she is just a hot chick who is quite intelligent, who happens to be black. Just because you are obsessed with race doesn’t mean the rest of us need to be.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That mayor in Illinois, Tiffany Henyard, seems like a black supremacist. She believes she’s above criticism because she’s “a black woman in power” and is paying herself $300k per year meanwhile she’s forging checks and flying first class and hiring her friends. 

There was that guy who ran over 6 people at a parade in an SUV in Waukesha, Darrell Brooks, he literally refers to himself as a black supremacist. 

So does black supremacy not exist because merely asking if it exists is racist?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My first serious girlfriend was Korean (I’m white), she was born in the states, her parents immigrated. Her dad was ridiculously racist in a way that was almost comical and completely stereotypical. He was mostly okay with me dating her. Said she wouldn’t be allowed in the house if she was dating a black man. They were deeply distrustful of any Chinese or Japanese people.

It’s stupid that people from the US seem to think that racism is just an American problem.</div>
