I'm betting on the former. It'll be hard to keep that community going when you're feeling attacked or too afraid to publish code. At which point it won't matter anymore, they'll collapse. Or they won't and it'll make waves in other communities. It really is that simple.</p>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I can't imagine a way, at all, where you aren't a little bit questioning their ability. Whether it's a test or through talking.</p>
<p>I am a <em>terrible</em> test taker but an <em>amazing</em> interviewee. Hell if you ask me to do FizzBuzz I'll probably so fuck it and leave (because I'd look like an idiot) but if you ask where a race condition is in a bit of code I could pick it out easily. I'm the guy that you can give a simple problem and say &quot;explain how you got there&quot; and I have a deer in headlights look. Give me a complex problem and I'm all yours.</p>
<p>Every job I've ever gotten was because I knew someone. Only two had a &quot;test&quot; that the blog refers to. One of which, to this day, I'm still the highest test taker on it. The other.. I did shit on and still landed the job. And now we've brought back my .NET 1.1 memories that I thought I drank away... fuck me.</p>

<p>Boom, done. And like that you weeded out a <em>huge</em> chunk of people. You don't need anything complicated to weed them out.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Well I think the problem we're facing is it's hard to define a subverse named &quot;programming&quot;. That's a <em>wide</em> range. So right off the bat you're in an awkward spot because of that.</p>
<p>Personally I'd prefer to see content like that as it relates to something only a programmer would care about or even understand. I doubt most on TIL know what CRC32 even <em>is</em> much less recognized it in the movie so I would argue it easily belongs here much less is borderline.</p>
<p>Another good example to consider is an interview about Kevin Mitnick (let's imagine this was more than a decade ago) on Oprah or something.</p>
<p>I suppose an interesting line in the modern grass is Edward Snowden. I would imagine reading about <em>how</em> he pulled some things off (from the <em>technical</em> aspect) would be reasonable but the political aspect of it would not be -- because quite frankly some of that was pretty damn impressive and I imagine many programmers would do well to learn many of those aspects of security. Or perhaps that might be better of in a security specific subverse. hmm.</p>
<p>Just something for you to ponder about ahead of time.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Interesting because they might avoid things like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16891019/how-to-avoid-using-printf-in-a-signal-handler">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16891019/how-to-avoid-using-printf-in-a-signal-handler</a></p>
<p>and this: <a href="http://mcuoneclipse.com/2013/04/19/why-i-dont-like-printf/">http://mcuoneclipse.com/2013/04/19/why-i-dont-like-printf/</a></p>
<p>If they aren't told or <em>specifically</em> looking for it that Googling could lead them down traps and bad habits that are often overlooked -- which is why so much third-party software is insecure and buggy.</p>
<p>If they were to post about the differences, we might be so inclined to elaborate more as well as provide alternatives depending on their situations or if they are doing it wrong. A &quot;simple google search&quot; does not net that because it's just that -- a &quot;simple&quot; google search. Some articles aren't even dating -- so they have no idea if the &quot;latest security&quot; is from 2001 or 2013. We, on the other hand, <em>do</em> know.</p>
<p>We also know to suggest using prepared statements and PDO for PHP instead of running SQL queries by hand -- which a newbie will not likely know (SQLI anyone?). We can also warn them about transactions and the importance of them as well as potential race conditions (something a newbie may never have thought of!). In fact, this happened to me! I was doing things &quot;the old way&quot; because I &quot;did a simple Google search&quot; and found out I was WAY wrong. Like holy shit insecure fuck me wrong. It looks me going out of my way to figure out what the latest bits where in PHP for security, how to handle things properly <em>now</em>. There's still one area I'm trying to decide how I feel one but that's not really relevant to <em>this</em> discussion.</p>
<p>See how such a little thing can have such an impact? What may seem silly to us, because we've ran through this gauntlet, is daunting to them -- I suggest it's better to guide them than to let them stumble like we did and run across wrong, or worse insecure, information.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be a <em>full</em> discussion because a lot of people may not <em>need</em> to pipe in. Some may go &quot;holy shit, I never knew that!&quot; and those would be our lurkers -- those with a toe in the water whose programming cherry hasn't even really been popped yet.</p>
<p>A curious thought occurs in my mind: What kind of questions <em>specifically</em> do you think are appropriate here? I'm curious where <em>your</em> personal line is for what <em>you</em> what.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Can we define &quot;beginner questions&quot;?</p>
<p>Are you saying questions like &quot;what's an int?&quot;</p>
<p>How would you rank this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4627330/difference-between-fprintf-printf-and-sprintf">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4627330/difference-between-fprintf-printf-and-sprintf</a></p>
<p>Further, is it acceptable to <em>ask</em> for recommended reading? Wouldn't this group be ideal, due to our experience, for knowing what's practical and what sucks? &quot;No, that book sucks -- it teaches you bad habits.&quot;</p>
<p>What separates us from stackoverflow? It seems, at least to me, the main thing is we link to blog articles and such (keeping current, finding new stuff). So should we redirect programming questions to a site <em>dedicated</em> to programming questions and instead use this as a place for staying current?</p>
<p>I'm thinking out loud here.. not pushing for anything.</p></div>
