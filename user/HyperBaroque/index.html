    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They got me suspended from reddit for 8 days for "mod harrassment".

Note from the pic that I'm using the mobile app. The mobile app has no way of letting you know the identity of the mod you're talking to. All mods of a sub are anonymised as a whole. So once they muted me, I was entirely unable to communicate with them. So not only were they the ones harassing me, they also abused the reporting system.

I'm about done with Reddit.</div>

Right afterward the community was full of sadness at the impending doom. (Keep in mind, there was a vote not to speak to the press.)

Any way. The community has roots in deeply left, "literally" Anti-Work stance.

I was a proponent of reminding members of this, and also a proponent of allowing for the expanding discourse.

I think I have reaped what I've sown.</div>
