Or maybe you've reached such a omniscient level of reading comprehension that you can see links that arent even there? I'm not about to research his argument for him, because he's incapable of articulating it himself or providing a link to the material he thinks supports his argument. I'm also not going to give a film maker activist the same level of credibility as an entire research institution that's spent literal decades collecting data and doing analysis.</div>

And I would never even think of using Vaush as a reliable source to provide referential information for, and it blows my mind that anyone would think citing a podcast would make them look good.

You strike me as an uneducated dipshit who's decided he wants to play cover for NAZIs for some reason. Probably an overwhelming sense of insecurity and selfdoubt. 

You want to make a convincing argument? Provide a real source or citation. Don't debase yourself by suggesting someone go watch a podcast appearance and expect that to be a stand in for your the case you're incapable of making yourself.</div>

This is stupid as fuck and not based on any kind of reality. Most of the time these fucking losers go out in public they're wearing masks. Openly admitting you're a NAZI and showing your face is a pretty dumb idea of you also want to retain the ability to get a job or participate in society. Which they do, the whole 'the only NAZIs are bunker-preppers' is something that you made up with no proof.</div>
