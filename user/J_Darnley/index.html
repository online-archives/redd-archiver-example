<p>I love the contradiction in one sentence.  Other than that there are a few good points and a bad one including his criticizing the use of machine based integers.</p>
<p>That one is particularly egregious.  I do not want to do my work on abstract number types that would probably support rational and arbitrary precision.  I want to do my work on specific sized data because it is audio or video.  I want that work to be fast since I am doing more than gigabit data rates.</p>
<p>Too many functions and types is right.  I'm looking at you Python.  I was recently forced to use you for something that was proving a lit too difficult in plain shell.</p>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The GPL does not restrict what a user can do with the software.  For example it does not prevent use in Iran, Cuba, or North Korea like (not that I care about them).  You can use it to build nuclear missiles if you want.  (I recall that Apple has that comical restriction on its software.)  A user of GPL software does not have to agree to any terms of it to use it, because there aren't any.  Any software which shows an &quot;agree to this license to continue&quot; box and shows the user the GPL is doing it wrong.</p>
<p>If you want to distribute GPL software or software derived from it then you can talk about restrictions.  I don't care that some dev or company cannot lock it away in their proprietary software preventing me from using it, modifying it, redistributing it.  Pay a license to some non-GPL competitor if that's what you want to do.  Otherwise, provide the source and any changes you made from it such that I could recreate the binary you have given me.</p>
<p>I know copyleft is copyright.  I would have no problem with lacking the means to enforce GPL on others if they had no means to enforce any other license.  It is sort of Mutually Assured Destruction but for &quot;intellectual property&quot;, except I sort-of want this one.</p>
<p>I would like a massive overhaul of copyright reducing it from life plus 50/70/90 years to something like a patent, 25 years from first publication, maybe including explicit registration, maybe renewal for a fee.  Everything created before 1994 (yes really) would have lapsed into the public domain.</p>
<p>On the public domain, some jurisdictions do not allow one to renounce the copyright one has on their creations, which is why something like CC0 exists.</p>
<p>Avoiding use as user might be difficult, especially if you only use gratis software.  For a developer, how do you accidentally include GPL software in what you're distributing?  You choose what dependencies you compile into the final binary.</p></div>

They are good in terms of technology and whatnot, their politics leave a little to be desired.  I'm not that familiar with other services.  Personally I prefer self-hosted gits by other projects.  Ones that don't encourage stupid, complicated history like Github (and Gitlab) with pull requests.  I run gitolite on my NAS to share some stuff locally.  A self-hosted Gitlab instance is becoming popular.  Videolan already uses it and I think I read KDE were moving that way too.  I ran my own too but became fed-up with the ten thousand programs and deps that it installs outside my package manager.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>If you have a website, why are you looking at VCS sites?  I think both Github and Gitlab offer hosting for pages associated with a project but they are supposed to be for docs and whatnot.</p>
<p>You're right that Github was bought by Microsoft.  Even before then it was proprietary software which you could not run yourself.  It has also removed &quot;problematic&quot; projects in the past.  The C+= parody project, some  gamergate info pages (Gitlab did this too), and another because it used a &quot;bad&quot; word like retard or boobs or something.</p>
<p>Gitlab is open source, at least the main part of it is.  They offer a paid version with more &quot;business&quot;  features.  All the options can be hosted in-house if you want but Gitlab also offer paid hosting for it.  I assume you want want free which they do offer on gitlab.com.  Allegedly it is simple to install and manage if you use their sanctioned methods and operating systems.  If you install from source or a package that was built from source then you are in for a world of pain.  It is several services to manage with tens of thousands of dependencies, none of which come from your package manager but the language specific ones.  FUCKING WEB DEVS AND THEIR INSANE SHIT!</p>
<p>There is a very friendly instance of gitlab software at <a href="https://gitgud.io">https://gitgud.io</a> which was started in the wake of gamergate.  I see they lost their Vivian James branding at some point which isn't a good sign, IMO.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161206142226/https://gitgud.io/users/sign_in">Old branding on Wayback Machine</a>  But they do still say this on the signin page</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitGud.io was created October 2014 in response to other popular git hosting services active participation in user politics. We wanted an apolitical platform that focused on the best features and technology for our users. Since then we've become home to over 6,000 projects and 9,900 users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I run gitolite on my NAS to provide some easy local sharing between a few systems.</p>
<p>There are more options but again I ask: why are you looking for git or source code services?  Shouldn't you be looking for common web hosting?</p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>As far as I know there are no bios setting to guard against either of them.  Turning off the virtualisation features would have just meant running VMs was slow and had no hardware pass-through options.  It didn't disable speculative execution of branches.  Disabling javascript in your browser was a good way to prevent a drive-by exploit just from visiting a website though.  Not to mention it is good practice in general.</p>
<p>On servers, particularly virtual servers, it would have been a bigger deal because you might have different users running different thing all of which could read just about everything.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like you misunderstand what the exploits are.  I don't.  I just know that one of them featured observing side effects from speculative execution.  I don't think either was particularly about VMs though.</p></div>

<p>I would expect 100 and 103 to be printed.  Now your case won't be nearly as simple as that.  <code>a</code> is still 99, <code>b</code> is still 101 and <code>arg</code> is local to each function.  When you say splitting does that mean your data in a string somewhere and you need to get it out?</p></div>

<p>Thanks for the reply.  No degree at all.  I made poor choices.  I should also have added that I am in Europe so there isn't quite the same culture as in the US.  The way I put it to others is that a degree is how you bootstrap a career (to borrow a tech term).</p></div>

Unsexy programming over SSH with just text is not visible and not attractive to those attention seekers.  I would say that <em>maybe</em> you should just tolerate whatever SJW shit to get a job.  I don't really know that much.  I've been working less than a year as a programmer and took the first job offered.  Nobody wants to hire an &quot;old&quot; 30 year old with no degree.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Yes.  Most communities around newer programming languages are shit.  There's the obvious SJW infection but I see a few other problems on occasion.</p>
<p>For Rust in particular whenever a significant bug appears in some old C program/library there's always some Rust people saying &quot;you should rewrite in Rust&quot;.  Fucking annoying and do it yourself if it is such a simple task.  Honestly these people drive me insane.  I will even get myself banned for insulting them.</p>
<p>Then some of these languages want to use their own package manager and repositories rather than what I have on the system, namely pacman.  Perl (not exactly new) has CPAN, Python (also not new) has pip, Ruby has &quot;gems&quot;, and I am sure Rust will get its own segregated shithole.  The ones used for &quot;web apps&quot; are the most annoying because those retard devs have no idea how to do anything other than hardcode a dependency with a specific version.  Fuckers!</p></div>

If I needed to do a multiple line match I would be sure to search documentation and the web for &quot;multiple line regular expression&quot; or maybe jump into an interpreter that doesn't work line-wise.</p>
<p>I don't have time to do the searching for you now but if I remember, I will try and come back and if you've got a solution.</p></div>

Its second worst feature is what version of &quot;print&quot; do you use.  Is it a keyword, is it a function?  Its third worst feature is what version of the language to you use.  2.6, 2.7, 3.something?  I guess a newbie would just use the latest.</p>
<p>I don't know shit about a TI84.  What did you make this post on?  It might be even better than a calculator.</p>
<p>As for what you should use, I don't know.  I started with C because that was the only physical book I had at the time and I wanted to work on a C project.</p></div>
