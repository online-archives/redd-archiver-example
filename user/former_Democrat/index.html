    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Why fuck us? The thing is you probably misunderstand what most of us stand for. Most of us don't think the virus is a hoax many of us are fine with reasonable measures being taken. However, we are also concerned that lockdowns are making things worse and not better. People in no new normal sub do not want to live in the dystopian Society that's being imagined by some leaders such as wearing masks forever. In both subs we are against the nonsensical restrictions placed seemingly arbitrarily on small businesses and how large corporations are being enriched and profiting off a pandemic at the expense of those small businesses. We dont think Amy's Irving properly considered. A huge slant words physical house and none being given towards mental health or economic consequences</div>

It&#39;s okay to suggest ISIS may not have been responsible, but not ok to disagree with that suggestion. Bunch of ISIS apologists. Disgusting.</a>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's all good until your beliefs become the censored trash. For one thing, if they are truly extremist views (and I did see some of those over there), all this does is push them further away from more moderate opinions that might sway them, into even more radical opinions. 

In America, ideas are supposed to be freely debated. Ideas can be challenged through discourse if necessary. It's one of the things that keeps Society healthy . If you make it so the people have to hide in the shadows with their opinions, especially if they are unpopular opinions, you lessen the chance that those people will ever come around by being challenged by other viewpoints. Ultimately, If you just go and ban everything that you don't like, then it's almost assured that some day people will turn on you, and your thoughts will be the wrong ones. 

"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— 
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— 
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."</div>

Suddenly  it was overrun by racist comments. It was something that happened very fast. Those of us who dared to say something were banned. There were quite a few of us who noticed. The Donald doesn't have that kind of talk. I've never even seen an n word on the Donald... </div>
