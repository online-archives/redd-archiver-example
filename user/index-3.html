AP drives most miles in a very easy and safe highway environment. No pedestrians, no crossroads, no domestic animals, no traffic lights, no snow, no heavy rainfall, etc. Just drive at a high speed, racking up those thousands of miles really fast with minimum risk and frankly minimum self-driving.

In contrast "human miles" include everything like urban environments and miles driven there are absolutely incomparable to miles driven on the highway, both in volume, difficulty and risk.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> The annoying thing for me as a programmer it's way more difficult to explain this concept

Then quit contributing to the misuse of buzzwords. Tell them "AI is a misnomer. We don't have AI. We have fingerprint-scanners. You push your thumb on the scanner and the machine does what you expect it to do, unless it doesn't recognize your fingerprint. Except the scanner is a camera, and the finger print is any given image. If the fingerprint scanner doesn't recognize the fingerprint, it won't do anything, even if it's supposed to. In the case of a car, it might not recognize a Semi coming head on, even though it's supposed to. Or that stop sign has a banana in front of it, so it isn't a stop sign."

> AI is extremely efficient at doing predictable tasks, not ones where things can change constantly with unexpected variables.

No it isn't. Pattern Recognition is not AI. Machine Learning is a baby step towards AI. AI could be a problem, the same as any random unchecked person with virtually limitless technological capability. 

We're about ten to twenty years from any semblance of true AI, especially if we keep insisting the output of any self modifying software must be human-verified after each iteration. Immagine if a child had to be 'paused' for a week to a month, for study, every time it encountered some new thing or situation... How long would it take the child to reach adulthood?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No duh. I've been talking shit about Musk's self-driving scam for years, facing Tesla fan boys who have secret info straight from Elon and are waiting for the FSD rollout that is just around the corner. Not only did Tesla brutally underestimate the scope of the problem, they also resigned on dealing with the most difficult part of the problem without which there will be no self-driving cars on public roads.

Mark my words, there will be generations of Teslas with pre-paid full self-driving package that will meet the end of their life not having received that update. The coast-to-coast demo that Musk promised in 2017 for 2018 (IIRC) will not happen before 2030, if ever.</div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So many companies are set up to fail when it comes to ransomware.

One of the key ingredients to ransomware attacks is to make split-second decisions. At my job, it's not uncommon for me to get hounded for updates from multiple people about multiple different issues across multiple platforms. It's also not uncommon for me to get e-mail notices that I'm overdue on a training (I am approaching 700 days overdue for one. I'm very excited about this milestone!).

To the point... Companies create a culture of split-second decision making and then they spam your e-mail with a bunch of additional shit. "Hey do you still need these privileges?" "Hey did you set up your print pass?" "Hey this mandatory training is a day over due." 

The natural reaction to having a ton of work to do plus a ton of trivial shit creates an attitude of "UGH! I guess I'll just get this thing over with now so they stop bothering me about it! FUCK!"</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You should look into the differences between instructions per clock cycle for Intel/AMD vs Arm or RISC-V. 

My M1 mac is not only faster than the i7 mac from last year I traded in, I can work all day, charge my phone, and still have 40% battery when I get home. 

This is a paradigm shift in personal computing and Intel and AMD are done. No one is going to buy a laptop that lasts 3 hours under light load when the faster machine lasts more than all day doing actual work. 

Arm is already faster at a fraction of the power.</div>

Yes. The people on the team who make these decisions are almost all white and female.

Big Tech keeps bringing up "oppression" yet the only black individuals they seem to be concerned with are those who already graduated from college or started their own businesses. 

Yes. We also want to help "Black Owned Businesses." But despite my best efforts I couldn't get friends and coworkers to donate to a few "black owned businesses" that were destroyed in riots. The only person who donated to the businesses I brought up other than myself was my girlfriend. 

All of this "inclusive" shit is 100% PR and everyone involved couldn't care less about people actually having a hard time. Fuck the 8 year old kid who has no hope for the future. We need to make sure that black individuals making over $65K aren't offended by industry standard terms.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> Our demonstration includes the study of the simplest function that cannot be computed classically in the one-bit limited space model: finding the majority of three bits (that is, returning zero if more than half of the bits are zero, and returning one if more than half of the bits are one).

000 -> 0

perm of 001 -> 0

perm of 011 -> 1

111 -> 1

> we explored what we call the limited space computations. These are circuits restricted to using two-input gates, and limited to using one bit of computational/scrap space. This restriction allows us to establish a fair comparison between the power of classical and quantum computational space, and in particular demonstrate a fundamental advantage of computing with qubits over classical bits.

A fair comparison. In which we compare two pack mules. One has one slot, either empty, or filled. The other has two, empty or filled. This is fundamentally comparing equal numbers of dice to coins. Of course the die is going to provide more information.

> our (noisy) limited-space quantum computer demonstrated a success rate of 93 percent, still beating the limited-space classical computer.

> the classical computer can only succeed 87.5 percent of the time whereas a perfect, noiseless quantum computer could succeed 100 percent of the time.

It should be noted that this "noiseless" computer would be where the technology is good enough to get clear readings 100% of the time. Bits are the classical's noisy version. Our technology has advanced to where the accurate reading of voltage from the same hardware is 0/1/2/3/4 instead of 0/1. In other words, there is a good chance a 'modernist' computer could match the quantum one, and we don't have to wait for the ability to 'cut the noise'. But quantum will become a buzz-word, and that won't happen. 

An actual 'real world' use case would be generating prime numbers, where quantum machines might really outshine classical machines.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I would be okay either paying for an ad free search engine. I'd also be okay logging into a service like that to select topics for targeted ads if it didn't require an email or any other data to register / log in. Considering the log in functionality would only have a single purpose it wouldn't be a big deal if you lost your credentials. 

It would have to be open source though. That way it can be audited by anyone so we know we can trust it.</div>

As long as your hardware is compatible the upgrade should be pretty seamless. Just wait a couple of weeks after they start distributing it before upgrading. Make sure you check for driver updates before doing so to assist in compatibility fixes. Same as you should do now</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The problem with Trump is that he prioritizes catering to his fanbase over deflecting accusations. So the Left Wing media gets him going, they get the sound bites they want, then they claim everything is racist.

I lean to the Right. It's frustrating though. The Right is dominated by people who don't have the balls to speak up. Consequently, the loudest voices on the Right are those that aren't necessarily the best representatives. It's another perfect formula for false narratives. 

I should note, I lean to the Right so I am harder on the Right. The Left is full of people who hate this country and people who are easily distracted by false narratives. "Hey that's racist." "Oh, okay." "Hey that's a conspiracy theory." "If you say so." Fucking idiots.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Take a look at some virtual machine apps. I played around with it when I was using Kali Linux. There are a couple out there. I did manage to get it setup and working. It will allow you to run a fair amount of the Windows based apps. I'm currently distro hopping, so my main machine (Circa 2003) just runs Mint. When I settle on a distro, I'll likely upgrade to a beefier box. Good luck.</div>

Don't use the gimped home version anyway. Its always been crap</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I could encrypt files and send to select people, or make public. It would be complete gibberish to read without a passphrase to decrypt. So the files are out there, but the key to unlock isn't. I could write a simple script on a remote server that would countdown towards a given date/time, and then once it hits that date it would email the decryption key to a mailing list. To reset the timer I would need to connect to server and reset script. There will be other ways, no doubt, probably involving lawyers/trustees.</div>
