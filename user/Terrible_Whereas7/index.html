And keep the personal attacks out if you want to sound credible.

So, I've already directly quoted you to you before, but "it's the guns always has been," does seem to mean that it's the guns, yeah?

Like if the guns went away then the violence would magically evaporate! We *definitely* wouldn't have poison gas attacks like Japan or serial knife murder like both Japan and England.</div>

Go through history, look at all weapon bans and you'll see two things that are always constant. 1, they were promoted as being for the People's benefit, and 2, they always were about stripping the people of control or means to resist oppression.

If you treat the symptoms and not the cause (lack of emotional support and stability) then you can't get rid of the symptoms. Both Japan and England are facing epidemic levels of fatal stabbings. The violence won't go away until the source is taken care of.

Don't try to push your ideology on others if your own idea of things is screwed up enough to think that the War on Drugs was a good idea.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Honestly, I'm always a skeptic on government intervention, so I see that as a last resort, a kind of Hail Mary effort that's doomed to failure.

It would be better to work on building better social interconnect, more community based activity. The violence is caused by a feeling of lack of emotional support or the idea that no one cares for or about the individual. I believe that the only way to solve the problem is by removing the isolation and providing emotional support to the individual by other individuals.

One school that was experiencing extreme levels of bullying and criminal behavior from their students organized a group of around 60 fathers to come into the school in shifts to act as mentors and emotional outlets for the students. Negative behavior dropped almost immediately.

I don't think that there is one solution to this issue, and each community will have to work out what best fits their needs, because this is a problem that individuals are facing, not institutions.

Trying to ban or restrict the outcome rather than fixing the source is like trying to grab the wrong end of a baseball bat. Not only will it not work, but it will only result in more problems.</div>

Why are teens suddenly choosing to commit extremely violent acts?

I'm in education, so this is a topic that is very important to me, not only because I might be shot, but because I want to help these kids.

All of the shooters have come from single parent households, with no father figure in their lives. (The one exception was an emotionally unavailable stepfather)
So let's start by trying to understand the connection between not having a father and the mental state leading to mass murder.</div>

They're absolutely a public forum (and thus not allowed to censor speech) but trying to behave as if they have the legal right to.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Reddit is trying to thread the legal line between a forum and a publication.

Forums can't be sued for anything said on them, but they also can't control anything either.

Publications can control discussions, but can also be sued for anything said on them.

Right now the government isn't doing anything legally about it (presumably because it's useful) but it's technically illegal for Reddit to sensor people.</div>
