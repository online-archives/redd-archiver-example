    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't equate the two. They're very different things, but both very bad. 

I really don't know how to digest all of this since he was in inaugurated. It's highly unusual, and since I've been paying attention to politics, largely unprecedented. I know new Presidents will often replace appointed staff simply because out with the old, in with the new, but with Comey, that should have happened a couple of months ago, not yesterday, particularly when it comes to the top law enforcement agency in the US. But then again, you look at the US Border Patrol, and a lot of the same stuff has been happening with them and no one talks about any of it. 

As far as money laundering goes, I really don't think it's there. He's been under audit for a long time over consistent years. The point of money laundering is to somehow inject bad money in to something, turn it in to good money, and then pay taxes with the bad money, to give the baseline appearance of legitimate business. He may be kind of a dick when it comes to money, but I'd doubt the IRS of all entities would somehow not catch on to it after years of double and triple checking his returns. I'd like to believe in the efficiency of the US government as a whole rather than think every person who's come across his financials ever is a complete idiot. 

As far as his innocence goes, you don't necessarily have to be the first person to cast yourself in to the fire to prove it. To me, that would demonstrate an overzealous approach and in fact be more suspicious rather than staying your hand and your position. It's like the whole 'you have nothing to hide, so of course you can look through everything' deal many people argue for. It's still an expectation to privacy that he, even as President, can reasonably expect to have upheld as much as any individual in this country can expect, even as holding the highest position of power in this county. 

In honestly, I think Americans should be taking a closer and harder look at Congress and at large corporations and holding them more accountable. We only hold them accountable when some really fucked up shit happens, but we don't really as a populace care before then. Why? A lot of politicians don't have Americans best interests at heart, and corporations attempt to exploit any and all loopholes they can to pay as little to no taxes as possible. 

I think what we are seeing now, the grand big picture, is people making a mountain out of a molehill with Trump, in the sense that he's probably a lot more squared away then we are giving him credit for, and seeing a mountain as a molehill when it comes to Congress and corporations. We trying to go for low hanging fruit when we could be going after the more succinctly rewarding fruit for the whole of the American people. </div>

And you are right. Some craaaazy shit is going down in this country right now. I don't know how it's going to play out, or what there is yet to be discovered. I didn't like how the FBI did not pursue Clinton further than they did, because by all accounts, she fucked up hardcore, and it sets a dangerous precedent for other government employees and contractors to follow. We should be holding her accountable for what she did, just like anyone else would be held accountable, and rather severely at that. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Again, a blanket statement. Not YOU, but you as a conglomerate of people. I have no idea how mature or immature you may be. I'm not even questioning it. But as an organism, the people who are agreeing with left-of-center politics are behaving just as badly as T_D was before the election, before being algorithmed to death, and triggering the entirety of this website. It's become tit for tat. There is no discourse, there is no maturity on a macro scale, it's a 'who can make the other look worse' war, and to me, it's made this website so discouraging to want to stay around for any actual news or any actual discussion. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'd love to see where you interpret my post as a personal attack, because it certainly wasn't, just like you didn't call me a Trumpette. You people is a pretty big blanket statement, because a laaaaarge majority of people here on this website perpetuate the bullshit I'm talking about. I couldn't give a shit who people prefer, if they do or don't like Trump or Sanders or Clinton or an alien from outer space, but if you're going to be critical of one group, be critical of yourselves as well. Otherwise this website will continue to be a hive mind of strictly left wing politics that not everyone agrees with, or has any impartiality to it at all. 

But yeah. I didn't call you an immature asshole, so that's definitely a misinterpretation on your end. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You don't need to like Trump in order to see this website is becoming a bigger hunk of shit every day when it comes to politics. People may disagree with and even hate Trump, but politics is an echo chamber of the highest order. If it isn't 'fuck Trump, Bernie should have won, not my President, Trump is a cockholster, republicans are destroying this country faster than climate change', prepare to be shut down for having a dissenting opinion. Isn't that the heart of politics? That despite differences, people can still find a way to have common ground and still have the same goal in mind? Look at all. It's resist, political revolution, march against Trump, enough Trump spam, and countless others that have done what T_D did. Everyone is so concerned about going tit for tat that the spirit of this website and whatever degree of community you considered it to be is gone. Both sides are filled with nothing but petulant fucking children, but it's even worse with those who lean to the left, because you stand on a platform of 'holier than thou, we don't stoop to your level' and then you do it *even worse* than the ones before you did. And then to top it off, you act like you don't see that there is a pervasive issue going on. Mods and admins intentionally targeting other subs that doesn't align with the opinions of their own. Doxxing people you don't like. Attempting hostile takeovers of subs. For what?! Because you simply disagree with another viewpoint. All of these articles are either about bashing Republicans and taking things about as far out of context as can be possibly done, or praising Dems without any objectivity to display their faults. Yeah, T_D got real fucking annoying during the election cycle, I know. I even contributed to it a little because damn, was it funny to see tons of people get upset over the dumbest trivial shit ever. But instead of letting it die out and run its course, you people made it in to a bigger issue than it ever needed to be. You tried to silence something that didn't need your supervision to begin with, and well, there you have it. A bunch of riled up immature fools, exactly like you. 

For the last 8 years, people have been made to feel like shit for agreeing with right wing politics. You people and this website are the same exact thing as this post brings up, a bunch of immature assholes who can't handle the opinions of others, and the evidence is the front page of all at any given hour of the day. 

So yeah, this website is bullshit, because all anyone actually cares about is validating their own stupid opinions. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well you're pointing out American atheists. What are Americans overwhelmingly surrounded by when it comes to religion? Christianity. Almost all Americans live in or were raised in a decidedly 'Christian' home. You're really ignoring the familiarity most Americans, atheist or not, have with Christianity versus almost nothing with Islam. I can't speak a whole lot on Islam because I've never had to deal personally with it like I have Christianity. I've never read the Quran because I wasn't forced to like I was with the Bible when I was a child. It's not a part of American culture, and I'd rather just not speak about something I really don't know much about, or care to waste my time in learning about. I don't need to spend hours on end poring through the Quran and Islamic texts in order to learn about it to know I don't like it. On principle alone I dislike Islam, especially for what little I do know that is a horrible reflection upon Islam as a whole. </div>
