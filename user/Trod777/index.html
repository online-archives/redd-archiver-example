I didn't put any emotion in that, it was simply a question based off what you've done so far. It seems to me like you're projecting your mental see-saw onto me. 

You trying insult me and implying im a pedo just makes you look bad. Again, it also seems like you're projecting, but im not going to stoop to your level there. Look through my comment history if you want my opinion on pedos.</div>

Tone matters, you sound like you think you have a moral high ground over a decently large group of people, and that everyone in that group is the same. 
If you're going to point out faults within a group or bring up statistics or information, you should probably do it with a nuetral tone. Save the aggressive tone for when youre emphasizing something or making a point using that info.

Calling someone a pedophile is more than just calling names, and even if it was just calling names, your argument turns to shit once you start that. 

English was my lowest grade tho so take this with a grain of salt, this is just what works best for me.</div>
