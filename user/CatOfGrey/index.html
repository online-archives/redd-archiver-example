Not really.  Ya know why?  Because I've learned how not to be an asshole on the internet.  Actually, to be specific, I've learned how to be an asshole, but only in certain helpful situations.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That subreddit has an interesting history. 

At least twice, the moderation team has been completely nuked and replaced, both with direct action by Reddit. 

Last time I went down that rabbit hole, I found them to be a somewhat diluted version of Republicans or Conservatives, or maybe Trumpers.  This has been echoed in the Libertarian Party, which is why I'm reconsidering voting for that party. 

I was banned from that sub because of a comment discussing how RFK Jr is a corrupt slimeball who is making millions off donations to his anti-vaccine organization, in exchange for promoting incorrect health information that cost tens of thousands of lives during the covid era, and is almost single-handedly bringing measles back as a danger to the world.</div>

It's a device that I've seen before, used by commentators to support their homophobia, by presenting the community as 'absurd'.

I recognize it from other homophobes.  OP isn't very aware, so my bet is that they learned the idea from other homophobes, and is now complaining that he is treated like a homophobe.</div>

I'll be pedantic - your comment can be taken as offensive by a lot of people.  A lot of people have been banned for comments that are a lot less *potentially* offensive.  

You did something that looked trollish.  So don't do that.  Think before you post.  It's easier to be an asshole than you think it is.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Worth mentioning that there are two levels of "Libertarian not actually being Libertarian" on Reddit. 

1. The subreddit itself has been 'taken over', with forcible changes of moderation, at least once or twice over the years by Reddit.  The current moderation is generally 
2. The actual US Libertarian Party is, itself, struggilng with an administrative takeover by conservative Republican activists.  So what you see as messaging today may be very different than the messaging of the same Party 5-10 or more years ago.  Small political parties have more volatility. 

Me:  I am a long-time Libertarian voter (20+  years) now shying away from the Party (see point 2, above).  I got banned from /r/Lib because I pointed out that Robert F. Kennedy was a corrupt lying slimeball that makes millions from his charity that promotes bad vaccine research.</div>
