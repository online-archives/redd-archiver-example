    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I think much of it comes down to whether it's something they intend to sell, which is often what gets the most programming attention within the company, and programming is what I personally enjoy. As far as just software to use within the company, yeah, copyleft stuff usually has more features and is a bit friendlier, so there's no real downside to using it. But for me, what helps me the most when I'm sitting in some cubicle, what helps me the most, what enriches and improves my work environment is well written frameworks and libraries written by seemingly angelic servants sent from God, whose truly selfless altruism allows some pathetic wretch like me, who is working and supporting &quot;the man&quot; to have some small level of respite from the soul crushing job that my eternal spirit has had to lower itself into doing, in order to support the life and well-being of my body and those of my family.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I like this discussion. I used to support copyleft licences because I liked the viral aspect of pressuring users to contribute improvements back to the community, but eventually I started to think about how I might be able to compete against big corporations with the intent of yes, providing for myself, but also for benefitting society Actually come to think of it, I think what I thought of before that was of my  position as a cog within the machine. Who cares about which tool is used to develop a product? Does the big wig up at the top? Well he cares about the cost and the risk, but he's not the one who has to suffer through using a terrible too when a better tool exists, simply because the better tool has a viral copyleft license. It's the developer who suffers. Yes, copyleft hurts the big companies but hurts them by means of attacking their lowly employees. Copyleft is all well and good while you're living in your mom's basement, but as soon as you get a job and you have to stop using all the tools that you know and love, it's then miserable. Better to support the paradigm from the beginning that you'll be able to rely on regardless of whether you're living in your mom's basement, working in a cubicle, working in an executive office, or working out of your garage. The only reason why copyleft is so popular is that children are communist shitheads. Kill all children! No, not really, but I do wish young folks understood better.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Personal projects are a whole different beast than corporate funded projects. Large Python projects can be kept from getting too unwieldy, but the amount of effort and discipline required increases the larger the project gets. With proper funding and planning this can be done just fine, but if somebody starts out prototyping and experimenting, it's a significant long term risk factor, but only if the program is going to get big. I'm not saying that more statically structured programming languages can't also become unwieldy, but the scale at which and likelihood of it occurring is totally different than squishy soft dynamic languages.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Golang because it's my favorite general programming language. It's a bit tougher than Python and a bit easier than C, but in my opinion it's better than both. Python is almost too easy. It's great for prototyping, but it'll spoil you and it's hard to stay stable as you program gets bigger. Go is harder up front due to being a bit more rigid, but it doesn't get unwieldy like Python. I imagine most any programming language would work fine for a text based game, but if you're gonna have flashy features, some languages may work better than others.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Have you tried the Go programming language? It's really easy to learn, a joy to program, fast, safe unless you explicitly want to be unsafe, and it has great concurrency natives built in. With how quickly you can learn it and get going, maybe you'll still have steam left over to finish your advanced projects.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I just re-read your post. On second thought if your problem is not knowing how to start your advanced ideas, have you tried Python? It's a great prototyping language at the price of being a bit less manageable once your code base becomes really large. But once you code base is really large, you'll know how to program your big ideas, so you'll be able to migrate to Go to make your program better in most every way.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Please don't downvoat me for recommending one language over others. Python and other languages are great languages; I just personally like Go the best.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It kind of feels like a mix between C and Python with some pretty sweet native concurrency. It has a &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy which keeps the language small and concise. Programs are generally compiled into static executables that include a small runtime that does garbage collection. Static executables make deployment easy because they don't need any dynamic library dependencies. It's still a pretty new language, but it has a stable feature set and a great community that is growing fast. It's not perfect, but it's far and away my favorite programming language. Other languages have their own strengths and weaknesses, but as far as learning it goes, I think it'd be much easier to learn than those other languages that you mentioned. Here are a few resources for learning it.</p>

It's real easy to learn and it's got a nice permissive open source license rather than a restrictive copyleft license like Java. As for where to find someone to work on it, that's gonna depend on how cool a project it is. Lots of good discussion happens over at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/golang-nuts</a> and you may be able to find some people who might be interested there, but you're probably not gonna find someone who's gonna want to just do the transition themselves. Get something working, then announce it or ask whether anybody would be willing to review your code. If you have trouble along the way, ask questions and such. If there's interest, they'll help. If not, then maybe not.</p></div>
