    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My wife is Chinese. It’s a not-uncommon prescription in a number of traditional Chinese medications and medical treatments. She would never eat dog under any circumstances, but relatives in the old country still do on occasion.

If this number is true, it is a statement of fact. What makes it “objectionable” is how it manipulates western values of pet ownership and animal welfare into demonizing the Chinese practices and the Chinese culture.

As the old Chinese saying goes, “anything that exposes its back to the sky is meant to be eaten.” -- which doesn’t include humans because under normal daily conditions our backs are vertical, not horizontal.

After all, what _is_ the difference between a dog and a pig in terms of the edibility of its flesh? As Westerners, we just treat one much better than the other out of convention, historical preferences, and social pressure, but this can also be used to weaponize our perception of other cultures against them.

And _that_ is where the problem lies. Not the facts, but the weaponization of cultural mores to unfairly malign out-groups.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;OP has no idea what a Hijab is. It is not a religious garment or exclusive to muslims and neither is it oppressive. It's clothing women wear for cultural modesty and empowerement.

Your ignorance is bleeding out all over the place.

You might want to talk to the women living in Islamic countries about that one. Because they are fighting - and _dying!_ - for the right to _not_ wear one.

They are being _forced_ by the _religious authorities_ to wear the hijab _on penalty of death_ because it is a part of the religious edicts, as a religious tool for the suppression and brutalization of women.

Links get a post automodded, but there are plenty of news articles out of places like Iran where women are pulled off the street with dog catcher's tools and beaten like animals just because they refuse to wear the hijab.</div>

You just posted on a right-wing subreddit that is chock-a-block full of conservatives, and largely set up for conservatives who had either been caught violating the rules of other subs, or posting patently false misinformation. Or both. Hell, in this sub I’ve seen a fair amount of posts involving _very appropriate_ “censorship” of antivax and anti-mask content, which supremely qualifies as misinformation and fake information. About the only reason why I even bother viewing this sub is that, much like a broken clock, they are actually correct on rare occasions. Because yes, even the far-left gets things wrong, and can be equally as ideological.</div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; I personally think that the better Peterson topics should remain

As a mod myself (a very tiny subreddit), I do have to pose the obvious question: by what metric should the filtering occur? Without a concrete definition that can handle many to most situations, a blanket action must be chosen to avoid charges of inconsistency.

With that said, despite being a traditional North American Liberal (*not* a far-leftist!!), I do agree that Peterson should be allowed. I disagree with his religiosity, and some of his conclusions, but he has the academic credentials to speak with at least some authority on the subjects he pontificates on. Certainly more than some whose articles we find here.

&gt;as issues surrounding him are a real test of free speech generally, and is also very relevant to what's happening in our academic institutions.

*Bingo*.

In the end, we must see this for exactly what it is: the banning from a Canadian subreddit, of a Canadian academic talking about a Canadian subject, all because that subreddit finds his views/conclusions to be inconvenient. And that is moral cowardice at its most corrosive.</div>
