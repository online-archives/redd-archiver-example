    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So what you're saying is you can't quote where I said that but you think if you spam more vitriolic nonsense than me it'll look like I did say that and you won?

Literally look at my comments, all I did was challenge you repeatedly on the idea that the far-right doesn't regularly use black-on-asian crime to present a speficic narrative. Anyone who isn't totally deluded can see that. That was the goal post, it always was. The only time the goal posts were moved was when you linked me literal far-right media proving the existence of the thing you said didn't exist, at which point you shifted them by rambling about how I actually had to disprove the data rather than prove the existence of a far-right narrative which used said data (which you had thankfully already done for me). 

I know that, and you know that if you aren't absolutely deluded. Your dramatic display doesn't change any of that.

Go on though, give me some more of your vitriol.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Qoute where I said it never happened?

My whole point is that treating it as an entirely separate phenomenon from the wider issue of increased violent crime in the black community is a tactic of the far-right - which you denied and then went on a tangent about how the perceived state of race relations in America is entirely invented by the media (which is an entirely separate issue which isn't mutually exclusive to the far right also using it to put forward a particular narrative)

So the point isn't that black on Asian crime doesn't exist, but that we don't have a basis for discussing it as some unique phenomenon which is somehow worth discussing as separate from general crime or anti-asian racism by any racial group., You're the one who moved the goalposts by asking me to argue with the data in that American renaissance article you sent me (which was proof that the far-right does talk about black-on-asian crime, which is a separate and non mutually exclusive issue from the issue of whether black on Asian crime exists (it does) or is overstated by the media or interest groups). 

Now can you address what exactly you think the mechanism that drives black-on-asian crime is if it isn't related to the generally higher level of crime in the black community? Are you saying that the black community is inherently racist towards

You've really just said a whole lot of vitriolic nonsense without getting to the crux of any of the issues you've touched on. No worries though if you want to be so arrogant that you'd rather spout weird insults than make a substantive point be my guest, it's really funny to me.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Isn't the gated nature of academia (I'm not a career academic, just passing through) kind of a demonstration of the point I'm making though, poorer people are prevented from having open access to information and are unable to better themselves which in turn leaves them limited opportunities and increases their chance of comitting crime?

That isn't the whole mechanism but it's an example of one facet of it.

Like you're referring to stuff now which shows you're ALMOST there. What mechanism do you actually propose is driving black-on-asian crime? I've presented the claim that it's a reflection of the general increased likelihood of criminality in the black community owing to income inequality, what exactly is your counter claim?</div>

Not paywalled for me since I work at an academic institution. I kind of expected you'd have some sort of institutional access to research since youre such an expert on the social sciences but that's my bad for assuming someone this arrogant actually keeps abreast of research developments.

It's kind of messed up that all the good academic sources are locked behind pay walls but at the same time if you cant access research data I don't know why you're out here trying to disprove the conclusions of this research. 

There's like a whole conversation going on here that you don't know about or have access to, that's unjust don't get me wrong and JSTOR etc should sort their shit out. But don't be arguing with chemists when you don't own a periodic table, no social scientists alive would question the link between income and criminality and you just betray your own ignorance when you act like it's a laughable proposition.

Sorry you don't have JSTOR dude, maybe like, do a degree or something since you're so interested in social science research and apparently have loads of money to spare.</div>

I don't remember saying anything about welfare or being antiblack?

Think you're a little confused here. You spent a whole day trying to prove the far-right didn't discuss black on Asian racism then sent me an article proving they did. That's my main disagreement with you, you seem to have it in your head that I think no black person has ever attacked an Asian which isn't the case. Think you might be a bit too vitriolic to carry out a conversation to be totally honest.

You're missing the whole point of the argument because you're too busy writing dramatic ramblings about worms squirming around and whatever.</div>

------


LOL, what are the ratios of populations?

(The rate of offending is always higher for the black population, as I've said before (generally due to income inequality). So the ratio of the population is not especially telling here, because we already know there is a distinct issue with high offending rates among black people which is independent of any black-on-asian race relations.)

What is the rate of asian on black ?

(The rate of offending is remarkably low for the asian population, so the rate of asian on black crime is correspondingly low, again this is generally tied to income inequality, except this time it works in the opposite direction)

" The margin of error won't ever be entirely one group though, which is what I can see your tiny mind try and go through hurdles to achieve "

(It doesn't need to be, the margin for error is over 4x the size of the discrepancy you are pointing out.)

Are you actually going to try and cry semantics and then pull that bullshit? You are seething dishonesty, goodbye.

(It isn't remotely semantic to point out that the data you are providing me explicitly tells you that it has a margin of error wider than the discrepancy you are pointing out, this is REALLY basic statistical analysis, you can't get mad at me because the data you linked doesn't say what you want it to. Ring the BJS, they put that disclaimer in there precisely to avoid people drawing potentially misleading conclusions like you are)

\-----------------------------------------

"Oh my god analyse the data"

\*Analyses data\*

"Oh my god you're just arguing semantics"

You are a literal clown mate, sorry to tell you.</div>
