    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I agree, it is disgusting that your mere subscription or participation in one subreddit can silence you in other reddits. This is what reddit wants though. The CEO of reddit was caught surreptitiously editing peoples comments during the US election, trying to influence the election toward the democrats. He was not removed, but they can't shut up about cleansing "Russian Bots" from the platform. What does that tell you? Vote with your wallet (it's your eyes they're selling, by exposing you to advertising) and go somewhere else. This place is not a 'neutral public forum.' I'm not sure it ever claimed to be. It's a cesspool.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's about a dystopian near-future where the government monitors all actions of the population through cameras and microphones embedded in "screens." All relationships are coordinated by the government and romance is outlawed because of the instability it can create in society. Foreign wars are engineered and history is constantly re-written to fit the narrative of the government. ie) Chocolate output is down 50%, but the government will instruct the news to report that it is down 60%, then announce a 10% increase two weeks later. Everyone is very pleased about the 'increase.' If it's easier for you, you can watch the motion picture, the one released in 1984 is quite faithful to the book. Perhaps that will pique your interest.

He who controls the present controls the past, he who controls the past controls the future. It's built upon the work of Yevgeny Zamyatin's "We", which was smuggled out of the USSR. I recommend that book as well. In both you will find disturbing parallels to how the modern propaganda machine works. The Iraq war lie, the perpetual "war on terrorism", etc. Instead of spending your time moderating the vomitous output of high-schoolers, I would recommend you try to take in some broader knowledge that passes through skilled editors. Unfortunately that limits you to the 20th century and before, since all modern output is "stream of consciousness" social media garbage, as writing became a completely unprofitable enterprise. There is no fact-checking or quality-control anymore, which makes reading works from this golden age all the more important.</div>

You don't think I know what it's like to have someone love me? That's a really hurtful thing to say. One day you'll grow up, and realize what a venomous snake you are right now. You're choosing to go down with the ship: "I don't want to read." You're going to die on the hill called "illiteracy", bitching all the way, how you refuse to read a book you claim is for 7th graders because it's for "retards and for faggots."

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I've never encountered a person trying to mount a defense *against* reading before, it's quite incredible. What's the best book you HAVE read? Go check out the essays and novels of George Orwell, I recommend Animal Farm, 1984, Burmese Days, and his collected essays. One of the most celebrated authors of the 20th century. Are you going to read, or are you going to argue why you shouldn't? Keep wasting your time moderating the pre-teen content of your pathetic subreddits instead of absorbing carefully constructed and edited content from the greatest minds of all time. Enjoy your 'social media', you're a perfect example of why this shit is poison.</div>
