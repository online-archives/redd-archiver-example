    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's important to draw a distinction between nazi cops and feds pretending to be nazis to draw attention and flare things up. If an actual cop were outed as a nazi they'd be fired within minutes, and that's not worth the risk. But a fed? Well, stirring shit up is their job.

Also, it was like two dozen people. Who gives a shit. The demand for nazis is so high that a few people in nazi getup was enough to spread like wildfire due to lack of supply, and that speaks to the borderline non-existence of actual nazis. It's not a problem in need of a solution, it's a solution in need of a problem.</div>

They could also be part of the woke cabal that's taken over reddit's mod spots. Back in the day reddit was good, before powermods in charge of like 200+ subs, and like a few dozen mods basically run the site. Every time that list gets posted it gets taken down.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Just because they describe it as a spectrum doesn't mean it is. Unlike light, there are finite variables. The question is essentially meant to pin down the number of variables, and failing that implies there are no limitations on gender. Given the binary nature of has/doesn't have, not having a limitation requires allowing imaginary attributes to define a gender, which is ludicrous.

For example, has penis/doesn't have penis, has breasts/doesn't have breasts. Those are quantifiable, and can be described in four genders. Every addition of a binary quantifiable adds another square to the number. Being unable to answer this very simple question means they either haven't thought about it, are uninformed, or understand that it's largely comprised of fictional and ever created genders. 

It has the added personal danger of the easily offended. By naming a number someone who came up with their own gender since the last update would be absent, and wouldn't want to 'offend' someone by leaving them out. Leaving it undefined allows them to make up whatever they want.</div>

Nothing they say matters to anyone, and their attempts to impose a global will in violation of a country or it's citizen's rights is pathetic. That said, even they don't mention marriage so i'm not sure where you're pulling that from.

> I would define rights as a moral or legal entitlement to have or do something.

You're going to have to go deeper. Where do these rights end and who's responsible for fulfilling them? What's legal entitlement?

> Why would me being from Europe have anything to do with anything?

It doesn't. Just an observation. It's like you're talking sideways to the conversation and it's a trait many Europeans have. Some of the US' talking head left do that too, i suppose. It's the dodging and redirecting of the point.</div>

I remember politics had a livechat during the 2016 election. I got pretty drunk watching the election results, so when it was over and Trump won I went through the scrolling chat and trolled upset/sad Democrats with a video of a 'reeeeeee'ing frog. I told them I would sing them the song of their people. Must have posted it 10 times, at least.

Only got a temp ban for a week. I thought that was very fair.

Edit: This: [Allow me to sing you the song of your people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qwU1LQZA5g)</div>

It's turned into more of a community lately, one of almost pure positivity, where honest intellectual discussion can happen as long as you're a decent person about it.

Really, it's the only place I can go on reddit anymore and find honest intellectual discourse. I even said I disagreed with President Trump's stance on Net Neutrality and it turned into an honest like three day discussion *without* me getting banned or even censored. I'm definitely a smarter person for going there... though let's be serious, they're also like 95% memes. I do enjoy a good laugh, too, though.</div>

Your sourced story is about bots reposting articles from other subs, not about vote manipulation. In that story he specifically states there was no vote manipulation to his knowledge, which is the topic of this post, and I can't imagine he changed his mind in a second admission letter. </div>
