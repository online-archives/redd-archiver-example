Your logic.  And yes, Reddit still fuzzes the votes, even on threads that have single-digit karma on slow boards, unless you think there are a bunch of ghost-voters who upvote and then un-upvote without downvoting threads to explain the karma variance when a submission is made, stays at 100% upvoted, and decreases on some refreshes.

The truth is your entire stance is founded on confirmation bias.  You ignore experts who disagree with your assessment and appeal to expertise when what the "expert" is telling you is what you want to be true, regardless of that "expert"'s credentials or your admitted lack of understanding of the subject and corresponding lack of ability to judge whether the "expert analysis" has any basis in logic.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; You have no links or any sort of proof for any of this. You just read someone else spewing such baseless lies and are repeating them, or you made them up yourself.

[Look, T_D doing exactly what you claim they aren't doing.](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6bxmnh/hi_admins_there_is_a_soft_rule_here_we_cant_link/) [T_D doing more of what you claim it doesn't do.](https://i.imgur.com/11Nlgk4.jpg) [Still more of T_D doing what you claim it doesn't.](https://voat.co/v/ThePedes/1867631)  You have presented no evidence that T_D isn't doing this stuff so... what now?  Where is your proof?

&gt; T_D needs no strawmen, unlike you and your lot.

If you don't need them, why do you rely on them so heavily?

&gt; It's been shown that there are bots attacking their posts. It's common knowledge that the admins modified their software, several times, to keep them off of /all.

Where?  The only evidence I saw of bots voting on anything was some guy posting showing a steady slope of karma over about 40 minutes on an anti-Trump post and claiming it represented botting... not surprisingly [this applies to posts on The_Donald as well](http://imgur.com/a/5BLvp). 

&gt; Now the admins have even given up on such manipulation, and just made their own privately curated list of "acceptable" subs the default, instead of what redditors actually want.

Except default subs always existed and The_Donald was never one, they *removed* the front page that consisted of privately curated default subs, and you are still entirely able to curate your own list of subs.  It's literally designed entirely around what redditors want and gives you perfect ability to set what you want.

&gt; Like you've asserted again and again, with zero backup for your blatant bullshit, is what you mean. Just repeating yourself endlessly does not make it true.

You are doing literally exactly this.  This is projection.

&gt; this thread is so old, you're not influencing anyone else with your disinformation.

It's 2 days old on a slow sub.  There are plenty of 2 day old posts on the front page.

&gt; Nothing you say about T_D has any facts to back it up whatsoever.

Curiously enough, nothing you've said about T_D has any facts to back it up either.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; T_D does not brigade, does not doxx, does not break reddit rules.

Yet they talk about brigading (and somehow show up in force on other subs), talk about doxxing (and somehow have lists of personal information for private individuals unaffiliated with the sub), and talk about breaking reddit rules (with an enormous fraction of posts threatening, harassing, bullying, or encouraging others to do so), but somehow all of this is incidental even when they initiate a sub-wide shutdown strictly to threaten the administration.

&gt; They've suffered from all manner of abuse, from admins, from other subs, from groups that organize off-site. 

Where's the proof you're so eager for?  T_D abuses other subs and organizes off-site, and you demand evidence for that, but when it comes time for you to support your claims with evidence you present nothing.

I'll grant you T_D isn't the only sub with hardcore censorship, brigading, and breaking rules, and all of the subs that do it should be dealt with, but you are blatantly lying in claiming that T_D "never hurt a fly," and when pressed for evidence demonstrating that you again present nothing.

&gt; You lot are just pissed off to no end by people holding opinions you disagree with.

Strawman, this is exactly why people don't believe T_D users when they make up these claims.  You lie, project, and never actually engage in constructive debate then get upset when people say you are lying, projecting, and not engaging in constructive debate.  Shit I was *defending* Trump supporters right to express their opinions last year and among the many saying that blanket labeling them was counterproductive to the left's efforts to bridge the gap.

Like I've said multiple times, T_D has taken every wrong step they possibly could have up until now and it continually doubles down on its bullying and persecution complex instead of making amends with reddit staff and users.  If T_D is actually interested in having the restrictions on it loosened, and actually interested in becoming a sub dedicated just to fan-worshipping Donald Trump, it's going about it entirely the wrong way.</div>

Go ahead, show it to the world.

&gt; T_D continued, and continues to call out admin hypocracy, because the mountain of abuse they get from other subs and groups, with full admin complacency.

T_D participates in the abuse and was the origin of much of it.  Nearly every submission on the sub contains direct insults of people who hold other views and posters from T_D continually go into other subreddits and insult users of them.  *You're doing it in your post*.

&gt; You've seen... yah right bud. Go ahead, show it to the world.

Surely you realize the problem with showing posts that were *deleted for breaking the rules*.

&gt; You think with all the harrassment they're subjected to

Go ahead, show it to the world.

&gt; T_D mods would allow anything like that?

Considering they do allow it, yea, they would allow it.  They appear to encourage it, even.

&gt; No, T_D is simply a fan club for shock Donald Trump. It is that simple, if you like it or not. They should be allowed.

Irrelevant.

&gt; All the shit slinging , actual real-world doxxing and threats you and yours are trying so desperately to attribute to them, come from others against them. Pure projection.

Strawman, ad hominem.

&gt; There is real-world proof of this.

Go ahead, show it to the world.

&gt; You have zero to the contrary, unless you wanna actually back up the constant flow of bullshit. You can't, and nobody can, because it is all lies. If there was anything of the sort, the admins would have been ALL over it long ago.

T_D was attempting to organize brigades on Voat, specifically so the admins of Reddit couldn't ban them for organizing brigades on T_D.

&gt; Truth is, reddit admins got pissed off at being called out on their bullshit, and suspended a few T_D mods for outing them. No amount of your baseless, non-factual crapola you're talking will ever make it true.

"baseless, non-factual crapola."  Ad hominem, too.
 
&gt; "it's their website!" is your excuse? yes, admins can do what they want, and they can fully expect to be called assholes for doing it. This could easily happen to you and yours, for any number of opinions you hold that the admins do not thing are profitable.

Strawman.

&gt; Diff is, T_D members would be right with you, calling out that crap, While you're trying to shovel even more of the same shit on them.

Ad hominem.

&gt; T_D has followed all the ridiculous special rules admins have shoveled on them, put up with all sorts of abuse the admins ignore. And when they said enough is enough, admins suspended them for it. :(

What abuse?  People on other subreddits talking about T_D?  T_D talks about and insults users of other subreddits all the time.  T_D exploited loopholes in the rules, T_D broke the rules, then T_D got new rules and the attention it was begging for.  T_D entered a community and were trusted to participate in good faith, then didn't.  It's not censoring political views to demand that those views are expressed in a manner useful for constructive discussion.  As is you have no argument, just a bunch of insults and strawman posturing while you make unsubstantiated claims and demand I provide evidence of things that don't exist anymore.

In your own words, go ahead, show it to the world.  Support any of your claims.

I just had a post auto-deleted for saying "T_D" without a link anywhere in the post.  This guy's arguments are completely made up.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's not true.  I've seen posts deleted on anti-Trump subs for breaking the rules, linking without np links, and brigading.

&gt; T_D has been under attack for a long time now,

T_D has been on the offense the entire time,

&gt; and have fully complied with all the admin's demands.

and you continue to hurl abuse at them and make unsubstantiated claims while skirting rules imposed because your subreddit refused to play nice.  There are posts on T_D and on Voat talking about brigading other subs from Voat where the admins will be unable to prevent it, and you pretend like you're complying with rules?  BS, talk of skirting the rules is strong reason to believe you will skirt the rules and it's not as hard to tell when you brigade as you think.

&gt; This goes so far as actual real-life doxxing and threats against T_D mods and users. :(

I've seen plenty of these on T_D.  Yes, it's wrong for people to do that regardless of whether they support Trump and no one should get a free pass.  Instead of presenting evidence of this and trying to work with the admins you've been attacking them, threatening to dox them, and making unsubstantiated claims for your subreddit's entire existence.  You've gone out of your way to make your community undesirable.

Yea, it was childish and stupid for spez to edit comments on your sub.  Those comments were also childish and stupid calling him a homosexual or transexual and doing everything they could to insult and antagonize him to elicit a reaction.  He shouldn't have broken but your subreddit has been pushing him and the other admins constantly and as a result of your antagonism towards the staff as well as other users of the site you have set a higher bar you need to pass for your claims to be believed and got yourself nailed with some rules that haven't needed to be applied to other subreddits.

the_Donald has done *everything* wrong it could possibly do, and whines when it's treated appropriately.  You've intentionally attracted enormous amounts of attention to yourself and now complain you want to be left alone.  It should be apparent how you have failed yourselves.</div>

We state that in the side bar and redirect to a different sub, /r/AskTrumpSupporters, for debate. It's fucking emboldened in the comment box.

Banning dissent is anti-free speech.  Having rules to enforce the echo chamber just makes it more strongly against free speech.  You cannot reconcile "supporting free speech" and having "banning dissent."  That's the exact same argument you make when applied to liberal subreddits, regardless of whether they actually ban dissent.

&gt; We speak about free speech because we've been banned in places that are supposed to be impartial such as /r/politics and non political subs. You can see there's a huge difference between the two.

Censoring relevant (in this case concerning Trump and his administration qualifies as relevant to a subreddit about Trump and his administration) dissenting opinions and claiming to represent free speech is hypocrisy, regardless of whether the sub is "specifically not for dissent."  Beyond that I've seen plenty of pro-Trump comments on /r/politics, anti-Trump subreddits, and non-political subs, you have clearly not been banned because of your political views.  Getting your submissions downvoted because the userbase doesn't like them is how reddit works.  If you cannot deal with that there are plenty of other places you could move your community.

&gt; You're really not understanding it. The admins allowed other subs to use vote manipulation and bots to essentially remove our sub from all, a way to silence our opinion. Don't you get the implications of this? 

Evidence?  Your subreddit has annoyed an enormous portion of reddit's userbase, liberal and otherwise, and because you do not allow dissenting or even slightly critical comments the only response possible is to downvote and move on.  Users opting out of your content does not constitute site-based censorship.  You've silenced yourselves.</div>

The rules change when they are broken and if those subs were causing as much disruption to the site stronger restrictions would apply.  A short visit to t_D reveals they are not actually being disrupted, as there is a distinct absence of dissenting posts and comments.</div>

Spez made a comment about it a few months ago.  He did it a couple times in response to t_D posters talking shit about him and replaced references to himself with references to t_D mods.  It was immature and he apologized for it, t_D has used it to further their persecution complex.</div>
