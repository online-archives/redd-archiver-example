<p>Don't blame the developers. I have been programming for about 20 years, and the problem is with the demands of management. Most developers I have worked with only develop bad code because of time constraints and other processes put in place by their managers. Most of them are as disgusted by it, if not more-so than you.</p></div>

<p>As for the servers they were not interactive at all. There probably would have been some limited interaction if I had downloaded the file it was calling and attempted to reverse engineer that, but I really wasn't interested enough to take it that far.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The last time I took the time to reverse engineer a virus it was because it was written in VBScript. I found that fascinating because that is an interpreted language and not compiled code. I wanted to know what it was the programmer was attempting to exploit on the target machine. The scope of his potential victims was limited to windows computers, but depending on the exploit the virus may have been even more targeted than that. As it turs out it was more limited to that, the virus was targeting Microsoft Office's ActiveX components. Most windows computers had those files regardless of whether or not MS Office was installed, but to trigger the exploit either outlook or word needed to be opened. Only people with MS Outllok or MS Word would be affected. As far as what id did, basically it made several calls back to various servers and await a response most likely to install another more advanced virus.</p>
<p>I don't use python a lot personally, but I would highly recommend it to new programmers. It is easy to use, read, and you still accomplish some impressively advanced software with it. There are also libraries that make it so you can write and deploy cross-platform desktop apps (TKinter) and is even a new open source platform for web development (Django) that is getting to be pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Not sure which resources would best suit you because we all learn in our own ways, but if you want to mess with reverse engineering you could download a copy of the linux distro &quot;Kali&quot;, install it on it's own partition or thumb drive. It comes with several tools for reverse engineering so between their built in documentation and a little google-fu, you should be able to figure out how that gmail immune virus was supposed to affect your machine.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I've only ever done it with the virus' that are emailed to me. I have also programmed a couple of my own just to see if I could. I never made anything more malicious than a virus that could quickly overload a computers memory by abusing a web browsers ability to process JavaScript code. That would cause a blue screen of death in older versions of windows and force a reboot, but didn't do any permanent damage.</p>
<p>You can start tinkering with reverse engineering inside your first year of programming if you really want to. It's kind of tedious though since decompiled programs have obscure variable names and no comments. That makes the code difficult to read and understand. To make them easier to work with you kind of need to use an editor that can re-factor variable names as you come to understand their purpose. Eventually that makes the  code more readable and even usable if you so desire.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>There are pros and cons of both options, and even some additional options.</p>
<p>If you are concerned with bandwidth, and storage space then you may want to call them from an external source.</p>
<p>If that is not a problem then you may prefer to host them yourself which may be be slightly faster since it does not require a second server be contacted for resources. </p>
<p>Also if you link to them on a third-party server that third party will have an additional data point to track your websites users, which may or may not be an issue depending on your users and content.</p></div>

If you are looking for some additional income, there are several sites out there. I use freelancer.com, but some of my friends have had good luck posting to their local craigslist, a lot of local businesses like working with someone locally, in case there are problems that need to be addressed in the future.</p>
<p>Since you are working for another entity, I should note that you may want to check your non-compete and non-disclosure agreements to ensure you can do side work without violating those agreements.</p></div>

I actually have a similar background as OP, and was here to recommend a transition to open source. I learned a lot from the experience, and as Microsoft is now moving to a position that is more friendly with open source (in fact they are even working with the team at Xamarin to improve Mono), it is not a bad idea for OP to position himself as a developer who can port existing code from a Microsoft back-end to an open source back-end.</p></div>
