And although you didn’t “insult” anyone going after someone’s age instead of their argument is an ad-hominem. 

The other user definitely threw a lot more insults and harsh words. 

My point is though this is what r/worldnews should be on this issue not just banning someone cause you don’t agree with their perspective</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1.There is no real difference between killing 5.9 million Jews in the holocaust or 6 million Jews in the holocaust. Or 9 million or 4 million. The number is so large and catastrophic it shouldn’t change how anyone feels about the situation. 

2. This goes back to what I said “ Also Hamas is terrible they killed children it doesn’t matter if they were beheaded or not.” It doesn’t change that Hamas went out and searched to kill innocent people including children. It shouldn’t change how you feel about the situation. 

3. I am glad you mentioned “going around telling Jews” again I am Jewish and I would never go to my synagogue saying this shit. I would never go to the Israeli sub and say any of this because there is no point in bringing it up. It would be tasteless and yes make me a douche. 

I didn’t do that I went on WORLD NEWS SUB how is that going to Jews? Unless you’re saying WorldNews is an Israeli subreddit or Jewish subreddit I wasn’t going to Israelis or Jews. 

There is a place and time for everything 

The worldnews subreddit is the perfect place to talk about Netanyahu and his right wing government boosting up Hamas. 

It’s the perfect place to question statements by world leaders of any country or question any organization. Nobody should be above questioning. 

Again it’s WORLD NEWS maybe they should change the sub to pro-Israel sub cause that’s what it’s become. Ever since I was banned I still occasionally scroll on there and check comments and you can see the Israeli bent. 

You are pro-censorship 

I am anti-censorship 

It’s that simple we can agree to disagree</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Saying you saw beheaded babies and there is no beheaded babies is a lie. 

You claim you saw something that you didn’t see that’s the definition of a lie. 

1. I don’t have an agenda but let’s for a moment I did. So what? Everyone has biases based on how they grew up; where they live and their understanding of the world. 

If I said this 40 babies beheaded babies last week and brought it up I would agree it’s distasteful. We’ve moved on as a society and there really isn’t any reason to bring it up. 

That’s not what happened. I brought this up a few days after the incident in a response to someone making that as we all know false statement. 

Netanyahu turning a blind eye to Hamas or Israeli finance minister calling Hamas an asset was not widely public knowledge when I said it. Even if I brought it up today it’s still relevant. It shows how the current leader in charge thinks about situations. Bringing up a politicians past statements is 100% valid. 


Either way all this is irrelevant. 

What you’re saying is if someone says something that doesn’t fit your narrative “ they’re starting shit” and they need to be censored. You want to live in your own bubble. 

This whole sub is about Reddit censoring people 

I didn’t insult anyone 

I didn’t say anything that was untrue 

I didn’t break any rules 


Just because you don’t like what I have to say shouldn’t mean you should get banned from a sub. You have very authoritarian views if that’s how you think society should function or a subreddit called world news. 

It’s different if I went to the Israeli sub and said all this that’s actually stirring shit and distasteful. 


Going on world news subreddit should be a neutral ground for people to speak their mind. As long as it isn’t hateful; spamming, or spreading egregious falsehoods it should stay.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My comment was a response to someone else it’s hard to remember the exact context cause again this was a while ago. 

But let me add some context. 

When there were first reports of 40 babies being beheaded I believed it. I even have comments I’ve made on Reddit to show I believed it and can link it here if asked. After a few days passed and there was no evidence of this happening and I saw someone else repeat the claim I responded asking for evidence cause at this point I had become skeptical.

Now explain to me how asking for evidence on a claim we now know is false is shit steering? Would’ve said the same thing about the bombing of that hospital? When that happened I said the same thing we should wait for evidence and it turns out I was right there too. 

Why do you think the claim was made if it was false? Why did people need to lie? We both agree OCT 7th was horrific why do you think they needed to add 40 babies were beheaded?

Again my comment was a response to someone else and explaining how we got to the situation we are currently in.</div>
