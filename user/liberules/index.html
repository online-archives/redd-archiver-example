look up the back story on john money and david reimer.  john money is the piece of shit who experimented on a baby.  david reimer was changed from a boy to a girl as a baby via surgery, and then started to reverse the transition to male when he went into puberty... dickless and now with a surgically manufactured gaping wound.  he suffered severe depression and eventually committed suicide directly because of the irreparable damage and horror he experienced.  then his brother committed.  then his parents.

the project was such a failure that john hopkins university banned further experimentation or study in the field for decades.  when gays got equality, the LGBT movement was hijacked by deranged psychopaths to reignite money's long debunked cult belief that gender is a choice or can be changed.</div>

the UN is the parent of the IPCC.  look at the date on this statement by the UN: [https://www.apnews.com/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0](https://www.apnews.com/bd45c372caf118ec99964ea547880cd0)

meanwhile obama just bought a $14 million beach front mansion that will be underwater if what he says is true.

and both AOC's campaign manager and numerous EU politicians are on video saying climate change isn't about saving the environment... it's about upending capitalism for socialism.

they're all fucking frauds and deep state globalist shills.  not saying we shouldn't protect the environment, but "climate change" is a doomsday cult conspiracy theory.</div>

in the 1700s, the US was over 90% white.  it took almost 3 centuries for it to move to low 80s.  then because of immigration reform in the 80s, it started spiraling out.  whites have fallen 20 percentage points since the 80s.

the main difference between white replacement and the holocaust is that the holocaust was the intentional genocide of a huge amount of people, while white replacement is simply duping a bunch of leftards into aborting their babies, not having babies, and instead paying for social program benefits for poor foreigners.  but white replacement absolutely dwarfs the numbers of the holocaust.

and it would be one thing if it was just skin color.  but it's not.  it's about replacing values commonly found in white communities that lead to an authoritarian wasteland.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">the discussion has been super scattershot across a lot of the subs.  T\_D, unpopularopinion, cringeanarchy and a shitload of the subs that went private after the cringeanarchy ban.

the problem is that too many of these social media companies took VC funding and the tendrils of political correctness are too entrenched.  that's why, for example, gab dissenter got banned from both chrome and firefox.

cringeanarchy moved to riot.im, a distributed open source chat protocol kinda like slack/discord, but that shit sucks for reddit style browsing.

really all it is... reddit and VC funded social media has started to go so far left on banning and shadowbanning normal every day conversations and basic truths we all see around us.  for example, i'm black/latino and i will readily discuss the "despite" meme... they want to act like the problem doesn't exist while i'm saying we can't fix a problem that we act like doesn't exist.  the point is that mods/admins/gatekeepers have moved too far left that it's seriously detracting from the overall experience for normal ass users.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">the mods made it private so it doesn't get labeled a cringeanarchy ban evasion sub.  multiple other non-PC subs did the same.  give it a few weeks and they'll be back...

in the meantime, there's a lot of discussion on a reddit exodus... conservatives and moderates are easily over 70% of voters and that super-far-left shit (that's only like 10% of americans) is genuinely ticking people off and has seriously become offput... we're talking like when digg's userbase left in mass for reddit and digg died.  that's how bad reddit's userbase is up for grabs right now.  voat and gab are too extremist for a mainstream audience though.  it's one thing when you have &lt;1% of comments as some stupid redneck saying dumb shit,  but when half the comments on the site are derogatory about js and blacks and illegal aliens, it's hard for a lot of people to stomach that.</div>
