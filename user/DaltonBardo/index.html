    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's not baffling at all if you are older than 40 years. Before the 1990s, christians in the united states were a unified voting block, and they voted primarily republican/conservative. 

This voting block was essentially broken up in the 1990s by Bill Clinton's presidential team when they made 'a woman's right to an abortion' a NATIONAL issue. By marrying abortion to the democratic platform and  forcing the issue, they destroyed the unified christian voting block because certain christian sects/groups are adamantly against abortion based on religious grounds, while other denominations do not have any feelings for or against it what so ever. By pretending free abortions are a woman's right issue, the christian voting block imploded on it self and the democrats have done everything in their power to make sure it never unifies ever again.

This some how evolved into an out right hatred for all christians in general, and now that christianity is on a decline in the western world, the democrats have embraced islam and are desperately trying to prop it up as the go to religion for democrats who need an imaginary friend outside their otherkin transgenderqueer headmates.  

Another aspect is the financial side. While the democrats are the first to point fingers at people like trump for taking dirty russian money, the democrats have been sucking at the saudi arabian money teet for 30+ years now. </div>

They are soft targets and  it's essentially a form of bullying. Muslims, on the other hand, feel emboldened to murder anyone who disagrees with their religious dogma and everyone knows it. It's the giant elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; The Bible is just as bad as the Koran, but we can't point that out without pissing off a huge percent of the country. 

Yeah, no. Let's be perfectly clear here. The bible is not as bad as the Koran/Qoran . While lots of shitty things have been done in the name of christianity, christianity was just the excuse, not the cause.  No where inthe bible does it say "lol go out and kill people, lol go conquer lands in my name, LOL CONVERT SAVAGES ;)" Those are things people did all on their own in order to increase their own wealth and power.

The new testament is the doctrine christians follow, and it's non-stop pacifistic 'be a good person, help the poor' hippy bullshit. The problem with christianity is that, over the past 2000 years, it has splintered into thousands of different groups who have chosen to use it as a banner to rally under and project their own desires onto others. 

No where in the new testament does it say "go out and kill people for having opposing views, its okay to fuck children, beating women is awesome" like the Quran does. Yeah, there's a lot of stupid backward savage shit in the OLD testament, but christians do not believe in the old testament. Your ass hole preacher might reference it to fill in air time while waiting for an excuse to ask for donations, but it's suppose to just be there in the bible as a reference to demonstrate how badly the hebrews fucked up and disappointed their god.

But islam and the quran is different. You can't be a good muslim by minding your own business and simply following the dietary restrictions and prayer requirements. While the majority of muslims may not personally ram a truck into infidels,  they also don't do anything to try and stop a more radical mulsims from doing so because they damn well know what happens to apostates and heretics in the context of islam.

The real problem with islam is that it isn't a religion. It is a political system disguised as a religion. In the bible, jesus tells people all this bullshit about how they should be nice so things will be chill in heaven when they die, nearly everything that is written is about how you  are suppose to go out and earn the right to live in some heavenly paradise, it's all spiritual mumbo jumbo. But the point is, the end game goal of pure christianity is to be a good person and you will be rewarded in ANOTHER WORLD. But the Quran is the exact opposite. It has laws and regulations and suggestions and demands its followers go out and fuck shit up in the real world. That's the exact opposite of spiritualism. Islam gives its followers real goals that have real consequences and it seeks to perpetuate itself not through faith or spiritualism but through violence and coercion. I can't think of any other religion that does that.                 </div>
