As I’ve said before, you thinking that feminism is a women-supremacy movement puts you in agreement with terfs. It doesn’t mean you agree with them on everything, and it does nothing to speak to your position on transgenderism.

This was a disappointing comment to type, because it’s just a restatement of the last.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> You just contradicted yourself. The presumption is that rejecting transgenderism is automatically invalid and therefore either the person rejecting that set of claims is either "hateful" or "ignorant". This excuses treating them with incredible bad faith. The same is true of modern feminism at large and men rejecting it.

Firstly, I fully reject your assessment of the premise. At no point does “rejecting transgenderism” enter into the realm of the men’s view. Only when it crosses into the belief of “feminism is a women supremacy movement” do you now have association with “rejecting transgenderism” by way of being ideologically associate with terfs. That does not mean that men who think feminism is a women-supremacy movement necessarily reject transgenderism.

> Except that the "men" you're referring to might not agree with Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists on the topic of feminism, and in fact a lot of them don't. The original post had NOTHING to do with transgenderism. It's Similar_reading who added transgenderism to the conversation for no reason.

Except they *do* agree with terfs when it comes to feminism being a women supremacy movement, which was specifically the topic at hand.</div>

Of course it could. And that possibility is fully allowed in Similar_Reading’s comment.

Needless to say, even if your point were true, that doesn’t equate to disqualifying men simply because they are men. It equates to disqualifying men and women simply because they believe feminism has become a women-supremacy movement.

Stifling of ideas, sure. Sexist, no.

Oh, terribly sorry. You’re just defending men that share views with terfs for the principle. I agree that does not make you one personally, and withdraw my observation.</div>

I did not read Similar_Reading’s take as applying to all men. Rather, it applied to men whose views are shared with trans exclusionary radical feminists. So all this talk of dismissing men’s views simply because they *are* men must be addressed to someone else. That isn’t what I believe, and I do not believe that is what was expressed by Similar_Reading. 

You, by taking personal offense from a comment aimed at a certain subset of people, admit to belonging to that group. If you think the comment applies to all men, that’s quite an inference but all we can do is disagree.</div>

I think I know why you got banned.

I am now reasonably confident that I know why you got banned.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I’m nearly positive you meant pedophiles, and no, Reddit doesn’t consider them a protected class. They do forbid the advocation of violence or harm on someone though, even pedophiles.

That’s not to say you didn’t run up on some power tripping mod. I got banned from a circlejerk sub for trolling - can’t even make that shit up. But that’s not even *close* to what I was talking about in my original reply. 

The idea that this was a trans shooter and it’s being suppressed by the media is the highest order of idiocy. 

Or this made up idea that there have been uncounted, secret mass shootings by trans people over the past 30 days. Pure drooling moron status.

Or that you’re a homophobe just because you have convinced yourself that this unsubstantiated, unverifiable fable is true. Optimistically, that’s indicative of mental illness.</div>

And your opinions and perceptions are totally valid, let’s not forget that. But they’re not objective. Surely you can see that.

Now if you were to just say, “they hate me because I go against their ideologies”, then…of course? Conservatives hate me for the same reason. But, while I’ve had *plenty* call me “race traitor” and other madness, I don’t claim that’s why conservatives hate me.</div>

Banning people for using the correct, long-ass acronym, LGBTQIA+, never happened. Banning people for trolling happens literally all the time. I got banned from a circlejerk sub for trolling, if you can believe that. Mod came back later and said they were being too sensitive lol.

People think something is real and it isn’t. That’s #2 homie.</div>

“Alphabet rejects banning people for shit like this” didn’t happen. It’s fake. Ragebait.

So people who *know* [something untrue] are definitively people who don’t know it’s fake. If you’re saying they’re doing it for some reason other than to justify their hatred of LGBT people, I have literally no feelings on the matter lol.</div>

- People who knows it’s fake and use it to fan the flames of hatred towards LGBT people

- People who don’t know it’s fake, but will use anything and everything (even the most dumb, unbelievable shit like this) to justify their hatred.

- People who knows it’s fake and don’t have irrational hatred for gay people.</div>
