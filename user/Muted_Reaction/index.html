The only ones who would have access to IP addresses would be paid staff members, and they would be held to a lot of legal requirements and i doubt they would get involved in something like this unless it is against the user agreement/TOS (like ban evasion).</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There are some people who post there that actually take the time to argue their point and it is enjoyable to have a civil debate. Granted you will usually get the random person who will interject some great words of wisdom like "Get Bent Senile Boomer"... but I would like a place that would allow actual discussion of politics without the mods pulling some nefarious shit like this. The fact that they are actually hiding it so you wouldn't even know that people are posting and it being auto hidden makes that echochamber even more of an illusion not supported by reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Also I guess point of posting this is so that the next person who notices what I noticed and searches google may find this exact thread and it will save them the trouble of thinking the mods at /r/politics are anything but giant douches.</div>

The thing is, there is absolutely no way they would know this account was an alt (and no.. Alts do not violate the reddit user agreement unless you are using them for ban evasion). I signed up for it using an old old email that has nothing in common with my current email (it is an old MSN account for back before google was even a thing) while using a secured VPN to Canada. I did these things not because I was trying to evade but I wanted to test to see if what happened on my current account would happen on a completely neutral account, and sure enough it did. What really pisses me off is that this 100% violates the reddit TOS/User Agreement and they are in control of one of the largest political subs because back in the day, it was a default sub that everyone automatically got enrolled in.

No posts were "removed" per say, but literally no matter what I post on /r/politics you will never see the actual comment because their automod will automatically hide it as censored the second I post it... To me it looks like it is still there but if I log off reddit and look at the comment it will not show up.



I actually tried to stay positive. On another account I actually only posted neutral comments and didn't post much and still ended up on the limbo list. My guess on that account is because I posted a breakdown on why I think Bernie's plan for paying for Medicare for all is missing about 15 trillion from his proposal based on the numbers he provided and other reports.

The fact that once you ask them a question related to their shitty policy they won't ever respond. Which is actually a violation of the reddit user agreement</div>
