    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;the majority of attacks happen where all the wars are
 
And why are all the wars in Muslim majority countries, hmmm? 

&gt;Most of the victims are Muslims

And 99.9% of the attackers are Muslim, the victims have no bearing on the ideology promoting these actions, which is Islam, nearly ALL the time.

&gt;And you are desperately trying to lump those victims in with fundamentalist assholes.

If someone calls themselves a Muslim, they are knowingly placing themselves under the banner of a terrorist, jihadist ideology. I don't care what their *personal belief* about Islam is, the fact of the matter is that Jihad and forced conversion, establishment of an Islamic state, and putting the world under Sharia, are CORE tenants of Islam. That is a radical. All muslims are radical if they are real Muslims. 

So we are at a point where the "peaceful muslims" are not actually Muslims. The only way to mesh with peaceful society is to be a "moderate" muslim. This is synonymous with being an apostate, because you cannot criticize or change the word of God as dictated in the Quran. Muslim scholars agree on this, it is the absolute perfect word of God. To change or cherrypick is to blaspheme. 

Do you not see how so called "peaceful muslims" tacitly support and give power to the "radicals"? Whether by aiding and abbetting terrorists on the run, as they do daily in the UK and France, or by funneling funds through mosques to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas?

https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/148180-170618-controversial-al-quds-day-march-to-take-place-in-london

This is the "peaceful majority" of Muslims. calling for the annihilation of Israel.

Islam has a problem, and it's not a minority of followers that contribute to it, it's the majority. There are a small amount that wish to live in peace, pray 5 times a day, and go about their lives. But that's not the norm, and it's clear you've never been in a Muslim Majority country by the way you talk. The absolute vitriol you can hear in any conversation about Jews or Gays or Christians or the West, FROM ANYONE YOU MEET, in muslim countries, is disgusting. The radio is filled with stations advocating jewish genocide. The Tv stations for kids is full of brainwashing "pro caliphate" propoganda. Al Jazeera and other news stations report Palestine militants as brave war heros that were slaughtered by Israeli dogs during the good fight, when the reality is that they were shoved back and executed for shooting up a school library where Jewish 12-18 year olds were studying. 

This is not a dark underbelly of Islam, this is the mainstream thought process. And it's an easy proof, why are these radicals consistently voted into power by so called moderate populations? Could it be that "moderate muslims^^TM" actually agree with sharia and forced expansion/conversion of disbelievers, and are in support of genocide of jews, and the annihilation of Israel?

&gt;So congrats for helping ISIS's narrative :/

If you kill your enemies they win, eh? When will you start to believe what your enemies are telling you they want? How many thousands of bodies of westerners will appease your white guilt? Will it take another 9/11 to believe that these people mean what they say, when they tell you they want to establish a Muslim state worldwide? When they tell you "we cannot lose, we love death more than they love life"? 

Thought experiment for you: If tomorrow, all the Jews in Israel put down their weapons and said "we won't fight any more, do what you will", What would happen? I think you know what would happen, the jews would be annihilated completely, and, depending on if the Palestinian army considred the jewish women worth raping or not (since they're subhuman garbage, as they are called by muslims), might become slaves.

Contrasting this, if the Palestinians laid down their weapons, that area would finally have peace. 


Islam has a problem, and you're part of it by sitting here and defending an ideology that wants you, me, and a lot of other people to fucking die.
