My Ubuntu machine is just used to write programs and connect to those databases on our network. Connecting to all these databases is a company requirement. </p>
<p>In most cases vendor software will work with only ONE brand and version of a database as we are a super specialized company, and there's only 1-2 vendors that has software that we can use. 
Hence all our different databases. For what we do (printing) we are a medium-sized company, we have complicated processes, thus there are only 1-2 software packages that even come close to what we need. Hence all our limitations in software and databases. </p>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I wanted a program I had more control of so I could make EPUB books from Markdown. So I did it. </p>
<p>I started out at the www.pgdp.net project, for proofreading public domain books which become EPUB books and other formats. But the books were so damn BORING and pointless beyond any people with a super-specialized hobby or interest. Thousands of hours go into books that almost no one will ever read. So I wanted to convert my own books into EPUB. And here I am.</p>
<p>In my work life I have about 15 reports for execs that just run automatically. Some run daily, some weekly, some monthly. Once the program works, my work stops there. It's literally getting tons of things done without lifting a finger. </p></div>

The author is very responsive to questions on the forum, and is constantly working on this. It also has a Code Explorer pane which lists all the functions in the current source file, so I can click on a function in the CE and jump right to it. </p>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Computer sci major here, I've been programming for 35 years. The most complex math I do in business programming is algebra 1 occasionally. Most of the stuff I do is trying to get multiple systems to talk to each other. That doesn't require math, it requires creativity and a lot of patience and research. 
Most of the math I do is adding and subtracting and multiplication, like &quot;add 6% to all these prices, but these prices go up 7%&quot;. So now I have to figure out how to raise the price on the correct groups of part numbers programmatically using regex. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, my uni required a lot of math, so that was a PITA, and I use none of it. 
It was a complete waste of my time. I don't need to make another 3d gaming engine, nor am I making a CAD program, nor am I programming orbital trajectories, there are plenty of good ones out there. </p>
<p>If you're doing graphics or engineering that can involve a lot of math and writing your own code to solve math problems. 
OTOH there are several packages (some free) to do complex equations (Mathlab). </p></div>

<p>Isn't this a good idea if you have an AMD cpu? Are there a few different instructions between the Intel and AMD cpu chips when it comes to assembly? Or do the (free) assembly compilers take care of that? </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I'm in the printing industry. We don't produce software for customers, we produce printed items. Programs I create are one-off and created quickly to expedite printed jobs. So mostly I do data processing to put it into a different format for the customer. And then the data is printed in thousands of copies. 
We do a lot of catalogs in my department. </p></div>
