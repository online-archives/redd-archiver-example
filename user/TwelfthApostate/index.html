    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Lmfao you have FAR too much time on your hands if you’re going through peoples’ post history to try and find stuff you disagree with. 

I don’t know for a fact that your post was removed for being political, it was just a guess. I’m not a mod. Chill out dude. 

To briefly entertain your fishing expedition into my comment history: yes Rogan is a joke, a moron, a conservative, and a trumpist. Maybe you should have read my comments more closely, and you would have seen that I explicitly stated that I USED to like him. He USED to be relatively sane and rational. That was the era where he supported Bernie, 2016, 2018 ish. He has totally changed since then. Hence, I’m not a fan any more. Every once in a while I’ll try an episode but I can’t even get more than a few minutes in before I’m cringing at just how unbelievably *dumb* he is. A middle schooler could debunk or counter half of the bullshit he spews. If at this stage you *still* believe that Rogan is a smart, reasonable, liberal dude, than I can only assume that you’re also a moron. I’m 100% aware of the distinction between actual liberals and the modern democratic party that has hijacked the term and used it to describe their blatantly illiberal policies. Rogan is neither. None of what I’ve said is supporting tiktok. Tiktok is cancer, and a literal spy tool and propaganda machine of the CCP. 

Where are you getting the idea that I’m pro-censorship? I am very much not. 

And no, I am not pro-imperialist. Saying that it was a moral duty to prevent a dictator from murdering hundreds of thousands of his civilians isn’t pro-imperialist. That’s human decency. If you lived under a murderous dictator like that, you’d be wishing on your lucky star that someone would come in and stop a madman from gassing your entire village or burying you and your family alive. 

You need to get off reddit and read a fucking book 😂</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You’re putting words in my mouth that I didn’t say. I actually explicitly *did* say that genotypes in humans do affect phenotypes and extended phenotypes. The difference between humans and other species is the extent to which we’ve altered our environment with technology, culture, systems of government, etc to the point that all of these phenotypes and behaviors are interacting on a global scale. A cultural trait from a small group of people can have a great impact on the behavior of a different culture half a world away. The same can’t be said about other species, at least on the same magnitude as how this plays out in humans. Our modified environment has an outsized impact on behavior, because genes can’t evolve quickly enough to match our pace of technological progress. Hence: sore backs and hemorrhoids from prolonged cubicle work, the obesity epidemic from automation/outsourcing of menial labor-intensive jobs, antibiotic resistant superbugs from our overuse of common medicines, etc etc. This isn’t to say that technological progress is bad. It’s to say that in our heavily modified environment, the environment itself plays an ever increasing role in human behavior. We can expect that trend to continue.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The majority of the stuff I’ve seen supports my position, but “the jury is still out” is an alternative way of saying that yes there is some literature out there that runs contrary to my position. It’s pragmatic to align your views with the weight of the evidence unless or until that evidence changes. That’s how science works. We’re constantly revising our hypotheses as new data comes in. It’s not doublespeak at all to acknowledge that. I don’t even understand *why* people would be so interested in studying racial differences in GI if not to validate preexisting racism. 

But this is all beside the point, which is that in-group variation is so much larger than inter-group variation that it doesn’t even make sense to plant your flag on that factor when there is so much more going on. It’s practically analagous to pointing to a light rain as the reason your ship is sinking after having hit an iceberg. Part of the story? Maybe, but not worth focusing on. Like I said above, *even if* genetic differences accounted for the overwhelming majority of behavior traits and outcomes, it doesn’t justify racism. How would you feel if you were on the other side of this and were the one being judged over preconceived notions and treated as subhuman simply bc of the color of your skin?</div>
