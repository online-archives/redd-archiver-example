    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; the premise of BLM itself as a movement is not bad.

The premise of BLM is a lie. That black people find themselves disproportionately victims of unprovoked violence from police is a complete falsehood. If BLM wanted to truly make black people safer from police, they would be campaigning within the black community to reduce black crime and stop the idolization of thug culture. But no, it's easier to just blame whitey and pocket donations on an industrial scale. 

Imagine my shock when they give no fucks about your opinions on the word honkey. They use that word and worse ones on the regular. Your support of them means you have no right to cry about it.</div>

By aligning yourself with a group that supports black criminality and celebrates confirmed thugs as their figureheads. You really think BLM is able to change anything in any meaningful way? What a joke. 

&gt;Do you not think racial injustice is a thing in America? 

Certainly not in the way BLM tries to make it out. Black over-representation in crime statistics is not the fault of the rest of society.</div>

The autopsy is composed by the actual medical prefessionals examining the body post-mortum. A press release is written by some flunky in the media office putting whatever spin they like on it. Here she is: 

&gt;Please direct any media inquiries to C. M. Hennepin County
Communications at c.m@hennepin.us. (personal details redacted)

A nice touch is that the name in the press release doesn't match the name in the autopsy report.  

&gt;Manner of death: Homicide

&gt;How injury occurred: Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)

&gt;Other significant conditions: Arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; recent methamphetamine use 

Oh, so it was murder where he had a heart attack with heart disease and was loaded on fentanyl and meth. """Murder""". 

Gosh you people. Anyway, how's the sneaker shop raids going? Got any fresh kicks?</div>

They didn't kill him, his skinful of drugs caused his heart to stop. Also, even if they shot him dead, it wasn't the lying, it wasn't the passing fake money, it wasn't his attempt to drive a car while absolutely shitfaced, it wasn't even his awful porn video where he couldn't get a hard on, it was his resisting arrest that led to the police needing to escalate force. Nothing more. He did it to himself.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; whether he was high as fuck or not is entirely irrelevant.

Not according to the autopsy that said he was so loaded on uppers &amp; downers, plus his serious heart condition &amp; covid, that it was no surprise that he croaked. Note also that the autopsy states there was no damage to the throat. Note also that in the full video he's saying that he cant breath before anyone even has him on the ground. He was dying of an OD and still, STILL lied to the cops that he was on drugs. They would have helped him and all this would have been avoided if he hadn't've been such a deadbeat, junky, career criminal liar. 

Note also the video found of a previous encounter where the cops approach and he swallows his drugs. Most likely the same stunt he pulled during the arrest where he OD'd. 

Fuck his family getting $27million for his worthless hide.</div>

Nothing except that the car was rented in her name and she didn't disassociate herself from her friends who put bodies in car trunks. Funny "nothing to do with" you're pushing there. She was a money holder and involved in the drug trade up to her eyeballs. She was a gangster and got what's coming to gangsters.</div>

Now that St Floyd's family got their 27million, of course St Breonna's boyfriend wants his share of tax payer money also. No room for wrong think when there's gibs on the line.</div>
