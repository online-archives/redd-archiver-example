    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They're not publicly enshrined anywhere. They've been PMed to the mods. 

Think of how stupid it would look if Reddit had to admit on the site rules page that there were special rules just for T_D. Of course they won't publicly admit they do this!

For proof, look at any post in T_D showing Reddit screenshots. All the names are blacked out. Automod automatically deletes anyone who links outside T_D. Why does T_D do that and no other sub? 

Because those rules exist. The *top three mods of T_D were just unilaterally banned without warning* by Reddit because one of them linked to the subreddit r\politics once. (If a user does that, their post is removed by automoderator.) It's not clear why the other two were banned, but they did it anyway.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">T_D has many special rules no other sub has.

1. Not allowed to link to any other sub, let alone any post within a sub. 

2. Not allowed to mention any other Reddit username. Even screenshots must have all usernames blacked out.

3. Only one post per sub permitted to reach r\all. Leftists create dozens of shill subs to get around this. MarchAgainstTrump, r\esist, MarchAgainsTrump (which is different), EnoughTrumpSpam...

4. Sticky posts not allowed to reach r\all. If they would have otherwise, they take up the single slot on r\all allowed to T_D, and no T_Dposts can reach all.

5. r\popular created specifically to prevent T_D from reaching the front page. r\politics and the other anti-Trump subs remain in r\popular.

Meanwhile, subs like SRS, EnoughTrumpSpam, and MarchAgainstTrump openly brigade and call for brigading both T_D and its posters. Admins allow this.

I'm looking at the front page of MarchAgainstTrump now. 10 (yes, ten) to 285 upvotes per post, zero to 58 comments, **except for two posts with 20K and 26K upvotes, both of which made r\all.** 53K subscribers, 1,300 online. 

Now, the front page of r\esist. 7 (yes, seven) to 274 upvotes per post, **except for two posts with 30K upvotes each, both of which made r\all.** 83K subscribers, 236 online.

r\esist is even more blatant than MAT. A sub with literally 7% of the active users and an average upvote count in the dozens can vault two articles to all with an upvote count *unachievable by a sub with 14 times the active users*?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The reason the front page was all T_D, *which was only for a few hours one day,* was when Reddit changed "the algorithm" to keep T_D articles off the front page but screwed up the code and made EVERY front page article from T_D instead. They "fixed" it in a few hours so that it had its intended effect of censoring T_D.

T_D has been artificially banned from r\all for months, and r\popular was created specifically to keep it off the front page. Upvote botting wouldn't do anything even if it did happen.

Think about it. T_D is the biggest non-default sub and the most active sub. Is it really a surprise that it would thus dominate r\all organically unless they deliberately censored it, which the admins admit to having done on multiple occasions?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You've cherrypicked three such posts in a week? 

Look at the entire front page of T_D at any time. Right now the lowest # of comments is 32 and the highest is 790, with the average being maybe 100. Looks organic to me.

Now look at the upvotes on the T_D front page. Every post has over 1500 upvotes, most have several thousand, and a few have over 10K. That's what organic activity looks like.

Then look at the numbers on r\esist, r\MarchAgainstTrump, or any of the other dozens of anti-Trump shill reddits. There will be dozens of posts with &lt;100 upvotes and one with 20K+ that's on the front page. That's what a few shills in control of a giant upvote botnet looks like.
