But in this country people have thick skins and don't scream about *muh feelings* every time someone says a bad word. I can pretty safely assume that you're from America because the instant you don't have anything substantial to say, you resort to namecalling.

You also didn't tell me what to google. You posted some shitty thumbnail and expected me to take it as it was.

I know this shitflinging competition is getting pretty boring, but I'd really like to see some proof how Trump is "enriching himself" with his presidency. It has literally painted him as the worst human being in the world for zero proper reasons. It's doing damage to him and his family's reputation that can never be fixed, but he's still marching forward like a winner because he knows his cause is just and worth sacrificing himself for.</div>

Wikipedia says that 15 women came forward accusing him of sexual misconduct. Which one will you belive? A group of random women suddenly accusing him of groping when he's running for president against the most powerful people in the world? Or a man who shit-talks behind the curtains with his friend like a normal person, and actually wants to make America a better place?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Being racist and making racist jokes are two completely different things. I got nothing against races. I make white trash jokes just as much. Often very self-deprecating jokes because I know how to laugh at myself.

Cool picture. It's almost as if I could read some of that. Of course you didn't want me to actually read it because after a bunch of Googling it looks like that article is from *1989*, and it's about bringing back harsher sentences and death penalty to violent offenders. I agree completely with that. You hurt someone, you will be hurt. You kill someone, you risk being given the death sentence.

"I want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence."

Isn't that only logical? Or should we just slap their wrists and tell them to stop being so *offensive and murderous*?

Also there was not a single word about the five innocents Trump so wanted to *murder*.

Please grasp me more of them straws.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; context matters in the English language.

And the context was that he shit-talked with his friends in private without knowing that it was being aired. People who recorded that knew about it for a very long time, but once Trump decided to run for president it was suddenly uncovered and made into a scandal. 

Me and my friends say all sorts of horrible shit that would make me sound like a sexist antisemite racist human trash if taken out of context and then put on television. That's called "dark humor". Look it up. People have made jokes like that since the dawn of time in their own circles and privacy. But I guess your skin is too thin to handle jokes.

I'd also like to see some sources of the calls for execution. From centrist non-biased news sources. Not Buzzfeed where you seem to get your daily news and moral codes.</div>
