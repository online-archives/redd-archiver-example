            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/1290901#6335623">Basics of AI?</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I've been poking at AI off and on for a few years, but to be clear, I'm not <em>really</em> a programmer...</p>
<p>If you understand the basics of how different types of AI work, like finite state machines or goal oriented action planning, you know that these are basically about making decisions with math. So to alter the difficulty, you find the numbers that control the decision-making and you play with them. </p>
<p>Like, in a finite state machine where guard characters have an &quot;alert&quot; state, an easier guard might only enter the alert state if the player character gets <em>very</em> close, and stay in the alert state for a much shorter time, relative to a guard set to a higher difficulty. If it's a more complicated system like GOAP, the AI does a quick calculation involving &quot;costs&quot; of different possible actions. You can artificially increase the costs of actions that would be more beneficial to the AI character, and thus make the AI make worse decisions.</p>
<p>This is aside from &quot;cheating&quot; methods, like just pushing around an AI's aim to make them worse shots, giving them less health, or spawning less of them in each squad, but somehow I doubt that's what you're asking about.</p>
<p>EDIT: If what you're looking for is step-by-step tutorials or code you can crib from, you really aren't going to find it easily. The <em>theory</em> is easy to find, but you'll probably be on your own as far as implementation. I'm not sure if this barrier to entry is <em>intentional</em> or if it's just that everybody who knows how to implement AI code like this just doesn't have the time and energy to explain it in detail.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Well, it's a numerical method, so it's never <em>exactly</em> the derivative, but it's an arbitrarily accurate estimate at most points. And it works by evaluating the function at several points that are very close to the point where you want the derivative, so it's like approximating the derivative by finding the slope of a chord line.</p></div>
