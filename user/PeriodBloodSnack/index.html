    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Reddit is strange.  Someone, somewhere will determine if something is offensive, and then the whole site appears to magically takes on that stance overnight.

It reminds me of a while back on a thread like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/n6sz3e/orange_cat_in_a_wok_dont_worry_just_a_joke/) where making a comment like "mmm crispy orange korean chicken", and it's hilarious until a few days later some snowflake comes barging in like ZOMG RAYCIST, vote-bots it, and it's now worthy of a site-ban.  I'm like... dude that's not even close to being racist...AND if you even understood what racial mix I was, you would realize how dumb you were for saying that.  Claiming to be offended by self-deprecating humor is like complaining you have to wash your own face because someone else pied themselves.

It's like you mentioned your wife is Chinese, and lambasting the typical mainland chinese tourists for being entitled snotty obnoxious cunts, or the chinese cheat-farms infesting online games does not mean you're racist to chinese people.

This site has a nasty combination of outrage+stupid.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I believe the admins are involved in that culture to some degree, as they have had several incidents relating to such in the past with admins, and mods exhibiting poor behavior.  I'm not entirely sure what to call the group as anything specific seems to be a "slur" according to mods/admins who will not hesitate to ban immediately, but maybe they just do it to anybody who isn't on their team or cheerleading for them.

I feel as though I'm walking on eggshells just addressing the issue now, as that group which has clout with the admins is very spiteful, and  trigger-happy with the ban-hammer.  Even the hint of some snarkiness or hyperbole about the issue in other subs will be "breaking a rule" - earning a non-negotiable ban, but then the thread is filled with childish cursing and name-calling, which is apparently okay if they're defending the mods/admin's political views.

You are just continuing to be that typical one-sided banter for what is essentially two cats with their tails tied together, and thrown over a clothsline.   

All I get from you again is that you hate Israel, and love Palestine, and say anything you can to support that narrative.   By all means,  you're entitled to your opinion, but because of that, you're not someone I would curate for any semblance of the truth about that topic.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">USA and Israel are tight with military intelligence, so It's not surprising they may get a bit more leeway with the media.  Still, I wouldn't be happy if Hamas were in my backyard firing missiles at me from buildings like daycares, or hospitals just so any counter attack at that point would look bad.  Then again, I wouldn't be happy if I had someone demolish my home just because I was the wrong religion.  I'm sure the USA loves the fact that they have a way to test all the new-fangled war technology, and Israel loves to have the iron dome, and to show their thanks by helping to develop stuff like stuxnet.  I don't see this relationship changing any time soon.</div>
