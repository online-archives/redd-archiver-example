    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If you're interested in the specifics:

- Permalink to my comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ghzmtf/if_obama_was_potus_this_would_not_have_happened/fqd1xbh/


- Comment I responded to:

    &gt;  "I'm still trying to imagine an alternate timeline where Obama acts exactly like Trump and how absolutely quickly he would have been impeached and removed from office if he did even 1 thing that trump did during this coronavirus response."

    
- My response:
    
    &gt; "... you’re joking right

    &gt; Or you’re just ignoring the headline news that Obama’s administration and their cronies led us on a wild goose chase for the last three years trying to sabotage Trump even before he took office. No matter what Trump does, these people say he’s wrong. If Trump came out in support of air, the entire news media and this whole hack subreddit would stop breathing.

    &gt; You’re ignoring what’s been right in front of all of our faces for the past four years. You’re ignoring the fact that the FBI was weaponized by the Democrats against the Republicans. You’re ignoring the clear FISA abuse, without repercussions. The outright lies about deportations and kids in cages, which we actually have Obama to thank for. The constant smear campaign being waged where unsubstantiated headlines can run all week and then corrections quietly run on the weekend once you sheep are properly misinformed. I dare you to go back and find me articles from any of the Democrat moral panics from the past four years and see how the “facts” held up over time. You’ll find that the stuff you’ve been telling about week in and week out pretty much always ended up being inaccurate, overblown, lacking context, or just outright false. You’re ignoring a heck of a lot. You’re ignoring the blatant hypocrisy and puritanical dogma of people who called Kavanaugh a rapist on national TV for weeks, but then run interference when actual credible accusations are made against Biden.

    &gt; You’re ignoring the fact that Trump took Coronavirus seriously starting in January and was already instituting a task force while the Democrats were too busy impeaching him with zero evidence. You should be embarrassed by how easily Adam Schiff whipped you up into a rage by just saying “abuse of power” over and over again with zero backup.

    &gt; You’re ignoring the fact that Trump initiated a travel ban from China before it was popular to do so. Indeed, on the day he initiated the travel ban, Pelosi and the Democrats were attempting to block it. Of course, two weeks later those same people tried to claim Trump didn’t do it soon enough.

    &gt; The list goes on. I’m not even that politically involved and I feel like I could write volumes more of all the stuff I’ve observed over the past four years. And that multi-volume set will only get bigger until more people decide they’re tired of being wrong. Trump isn’t really my style, but damn you people are irritating with your endless screeching, dogmatic hysteria, and utter anti-intellectuality at every turn.

    &gt; It’s like, I’m not going to magically agree with you just because you come up with new ways to call Trump an asshole every day. Give me a reason. Give me facts that don’t get proven false days later. Give me policies that are proven to actually work and make a good argument instead of just “Trump is literally Hitler”. Fucks sake you guys are dumb.

    &gt; The Democrat party is fracturing more and more every day because of this stuff. You can’t fight common sense, science, math, and the truth all at the same time."

No rules broken. Some profanity, but nothing like other stuff I see there. Only things I did wrong was pay attention to the news and think.
