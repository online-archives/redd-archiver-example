        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I read the first bit and this is written by somebody who knows enough to think they know waaay more than they do. This is probably somebody who has taken Bio I and decided they could write a confirmation bias driven analysis of COVID. 

For example: 

&gt;If the virus exists, then it should be possible to purify viral particles. From these particles RNA can be extracted and should match the RNA used in this test.

The genome has been sequenced for a very loong time. Like since before COVID was an everyday name in the US. 

&gt;A couple of symptoms, maybe contact with a previous patient, and a test of unknown accuracy, is all you often need.

This is not scientific writing. This is op ed writing. This is not sourced and the author will likely hide behind the fact that this is presented as a haphazard matter of tone. This reduced the process of developing a diagnosis and cuts medical reasoning down to a passive and diagnosis seeking algorithm. 

&gt;While the definition of SARS, an earlier coronavirus panic, was self-limiting, the definition of COVID-19disease is open-ended, allowing the imaginary epidemic to grow.

Yes, they are two different diseases. "People are totally cool with beetles, so why do they hate German Cockroaches?!?!?!"

&gt;Putting aside the existence of the virus, if the COVID-19test has a problem with false positives (as all biological tests do) then testing an uninfected population will produce only false-positive tests, and the definition of the disease will allow the epidemic to go onforever.

No discussion of sensitivity or selectivity. In fact the test has a *much much much* larger problem with *false-negatives.*

&gt;The COVID-19test is based on PCR, a DNA manufacturing technique. When used as a test it does not produce a positive/negative result, but simply the number of cycles required to detect sufficient material to beat the arbitrary cutoff between positive and negative. If positive means infected and negative means uninfected, then there are cases of people going from infected to uninfected and back to infected again in a couple of days. 

This was written by somebody who watched half of a youtube video on PCR and would fail any Genetics I pop quiz. 

PCR does not "manufacture" DNA, it produces copies of a specific sequence if that is present in the sample. So, if your sample has some of the requisite (RNA in this case), the PCR templates will match with it in an exact fit and create copies through many cycles.

Cutoffs for tests are not "arbitrary" they are based on careful statistical analysis. 

**OP, your guy is writing at a 12th grade level and has nothing new, important, well-informed, well-researched, or useful to say.** This is a fool stricten with a severe case of Dunning-Kruger who knows just enough about science to write convincingly to lay people, but has the scientific chops of a freshman who is failing his classes and contemplating changing his major.</div>
