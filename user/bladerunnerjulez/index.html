&gt;I dont understand why having a genital preference is transphobic? That sounds weird to me - does not liking a vaginas make me hetrogenitalphobic or femalebodyphobic - it just sounds silly and made up. 


It's absolutely not made up. If you think through the logic of trans ideology that has over taken the movement, this is the only logical conclusion you can come to. If a trans woman is literally a woman then cutting them out of your dating pool *is * transphobic because you're denying that they are anything but a woman. They are not happy with the sentiment that "transwomen are transwomen and that's perfectly okay" they see that as transphobic. To them the only acceptable message is that "transwomen are literally just women".


&gt;As for the militant thing well you get that from people who are fanatic rick and morty fans ffs - nationalism, rascims ect so the fact that the trans community have a militant vocal minority should not be suprising, unique or something to judge them over-

It is when the movement actually embraces these ideas and does nothing to distance themselves from their militants. Democrats and leftists have the same problem, they never speak out against the more radical subsets of their ideologies. Right wingers tend to be vocal about condemning the white supremacists on their side.

Edit: I'm not saying that rational and normal trans people don't exist, their voices are just not amplified. I follow Blaire White because she is a rational trans person who doesn't deny biological reality and rejects the radicals, but even she gets so much hate. Ironically she is called transphobic and bigoted by other LGBTQ+ people.</div>

&gt;Equity, equality, womens rights, gay rights, adoption laws, climate change measures, anti gun laws, social justice, euthanasia, being pro choice, .. cannot be up for bigots to debate

Yes well you're trying to force society to accept your views and refuse to even hear the other sides view on some of those things. Someone who is this self assured of their ideology, who probably never even has an honest conversation with someone who might have a different view than you. You sound like a radical and an authoritarian. Holding onto this ideology with religious fervor. 

People like you are dangerous because you are so sure of your beliefs and that you're on the "right side of history", sometimes that ends with a lot lives destroyed.

Maybe you should realize that there are nuanced arguments to a lot of the things you mentioned that perhaps you should listen to before taking such a hard stance.</div>

I don't know what you're talking about as far as allowing Erdogas  bodyguards to assault a US citizen. I don't believe that he violated the emoluments clause and I also don't believe that he did anything wrong in regards to asking Ukraine to investigate Burisma, There's absolutely no evidence of wrong doing on that part.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">All I know is that jobs are plenty, we have record low unemployment and regular people, on average are making more than they were before. The economy in general is doing great and I belive that Trump is trying to get some of those manufacturing jobs back, hence the trade war with China, though I'll admit I don't know much about it and honestly with AI becoming more prominent we should probably look at alternative solutions to this problem. I would say outsourcing our labor and manufacturing as little as possible is a good step though, and I was under the impression that Trump was working towards that goal. At the very least, by getting rid of needless, business killing regulations he has helped reinvigorate the job market and our economy.

I don't think he is our greatest president, but considering the alternatives he is the best we've got and I'm happy to cast my vote for him if it's going to he between him and any of the DNC front runners.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm exactly where you are, always have been pretty left leaning, I never really considered myself a Democrat, more of an independent, but I would choose dems over Republicans any day of the week. Hell I was all on the Trump hate train during the election.  Now I cannot bring myself to support the DNC, they have outed themselves as corrupt, vindictive, lying, anti american, anti constitutional bullies and I see that Trump is actually not that bad. 2020 is the first time in my life I will vote for a Republican, though I don't really see Trump as a true Republican, he is pretty liberal and has brought the republicans a bit closer to the left imo on a ton of issues. I think there are many people like me, and many of us chose to stay silent irl because of all the hate that we'd get. I checked that site that shows everyone who donated to Trump (I think its http//racist.watch) and so many in my highly liberal area have donated. So unless the DNC straight up manipulates votes and stuffs ballot boxes, or the economy tanks hard in the next year, I don't see how Trump is not going to get reelected.</div>

&gt;ou are lying no one who was against trump before is with him now. 

Lol, well I'm not sure that I want to read anymore of your wall of text because this is indeed what happened to me and a lot of people I know.  Many people who supported Obama and Bernie and who were against Trump in the begining became Trump supporters. This right here is a reason why the dems will lose again in 2020, you people are completely tone deaf.


Well I just read the part where you say that Trump has done nothing for the country, which shows how absolutely brainwashed you are. How about the lowest unemployment rate in a long ass time, how about prison reform? Trump has done plenty of positive things, much more than his predecessor or Bush. But of course you think that you're somehow better because you don't watxh tv? I dont either, but I bet that you read the shitty opinion pieces that get passed off as news now and days. If you can't see the lies that are being crammed down your throat then I feel sorry for you.


Edit: oh and now I got to the part that says you're blocking me because you absolutely can't handle a civil discussion. Who is being shortsighted, who is falling into the trap of just believing whatever propanganda gets thrown at you. If you can read this, name me some policies of Trumps that you feel have detrimental to the country, I het you couldn't come up with anything because your hate of Trump only rests on his personality and not his actions or policies. You come off as a typical NPC and I'm sorry for you because when you grow up you will look back on this and cringe at your stupidity and complacency.</div>

These kinds of conversations are important imo so I welcome them. If you can't understand where Trump supporters are xoming from I feel that you're only ingesting the news that fits your bias already. I was vehemently against Trump in the begining and I fell for all the negative shit that the MSM is pushing (btw, you don't have to watch TV to be affected by that, there is so much lazy and biased reporting everywhere that it's hard to get to the truth of the matter). If you don't understand where the critism for things like universal healthcare is coming from then you are not really listening to what Trump supporters and the like are saying. If you see Trump as some sort of criminal then youre not paying attention and its not my job to educate you. All I can say is, really think about what the world would look like if you can get all these changes that you so blindly advocate from without listening to the actual people that these changes will affect. I wish you luck on your journey though and gods bless you.</div>

I mean I could be wrong and the majority of the loudest on reddit are just shills which is another good reason to jump ship from this site.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well yes of course. Reality is far more complicated and the truth may not always reflect one's beliefs. Instead of analyzing things criticially these types of people find it easier to turn a blind eye or to demonize anything that doesnt fit their narrative, that way they don't have to come up with real life solutions to real life problems and they don't have to look inward at their own faults or complacency. So much easier to just scape goat a boogy man by dismissing everything they don't like as white supremacy or alt right and then think that you're somehow superior to the masses because you're so woke. Fucking clown world indeed.</div>

This attitude is not liberal it is leftist, liberals don't believe in censorship and thought control.</div>
