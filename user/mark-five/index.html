    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You were censored for discussing ongoing fascism by the American government on a platform that is very likely still receiving funding by that corporatist partnership for this explicit purpose.  This was exactly how the creator of the Fascist Party intended fascist partnerships to function 100 years ago.  The one thing above all right now they are likely to suppress is further exposure of their own fascism.  It is damaging to both sides of the corporatist partnership, government and private corps.  This runs against a fascist partnership's purpose which is to benefit both corporation and politician on the public's dime.

I'm afraid that, historically, speaking, fascism rarely stops with mildly inconveincing its critics like this and will likely get much worse.</div>

No snark intended and I forgive you for whatever it is that has prompted your aggressive confrontation seeking response.

I'm sorry for the part I played in this outburst, and I hope whatever it was is gone soon and you feel better quickly.  You don't deserve whatever it was that made you feel this way.   Be well!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Actually no, thats not at all what fascism's creator defined it as.  Fascism's inventor defined it in the fewest simplest way as corporatism because its a merger of corporate and state powers.   He used those powers to have media suppress his opponents so they had no voice, and to spread propaganda so people would hate who they were told to hate on command.  Whenever you hear "It's a private corporation it can do anything it wants" while its working against you on behalf of the government, look for reasons they might be working for political parties, like the payments Musk proved on twitter.  That proved fascism is happening in American government right now with zero room for denial.

Definitely don't just go throwing it around derisively or think it means anything you don't like, or any kind of authoritarian regime.  Know what it means and how it has come to America waving flags just as predicted.

Fascism was easy to implement considering media is only owned by a half dozen or so interests.  We likely have fascists fighting fascists to control whose propaganda is heard loudest right now, but for now the proof of fascism is rather one sided as only one media corporation's CEO was willing to go public to confirm political payments for meddling have been standard practice.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I absolutely agree with you.  This time, it is used literally by the dictionary.   We need to continue to use it exactly as defined, rather than how Congress has been throwing it around for anything they don't like, similarly to how they use "fascism" for anything they don't like rather than as another word for corporatism as defined by the political party's creator.

It's only a matter of time before corporatists receiving government money to censor on behalf of political agendas start censoring the dictionary, but right now the actual definition is not being censored just denied.</div>

Good luck becoming a better person.  I hope you can find a way; and I forgive you for your aggression.  Fears make people do bad things.  You'll be good some day.  You won't have those fears you keep mentioning some day.  Be well.  Do well.  Don't take action prompted by the aggression you are displaying.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If you feel frightened by the dictionary, thats a you issue.    You can't change a definition by projecting your issues onto others.

I hope you get your answers and find a way to quell your fears you brought up.  It sounds your fear is affecting your ability to reason right now, so I truly do hope you can.  Especially if you're harboring unmentioned thoughts that drove you to subtly try and deny the definition of terrorism.  If the dictionary hits too close to home for your comfort, maybe it's a good inflection point.  Good luck.</div>

You know it as well as the rest of us now if you didn't know it 30 minutes ago, *the use or threat of violence especially against the  public as a politically motivated means of  coercion* is the topic of today.  A terrorist started this discussion among many around the nation with their act of politically motivated violence against children.

By the time they get to the middle, you know all about the physical attacks and by the end those extremists are coming up with new ways to carry out exterminations at various degrees of scale.

This isn't a new phenomena.  It repeats every few decades throughout the globe.  It usually doesn't reach the middle part without great opposition and rarely manages to get to their endgame stage, but when it does nobody ever forgets.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This isn't advocating censorship.  Censorship is the opposite of sharing knowledge.  Reddit has chosen to censor wrongthink.  They have shown that agents provocateur can be used to eliminate any group they disagree with, and this information shows that they are selective about their censorship.  Reddit admins have an agenda they are playing out and won't be swayed by this info - they have chosen censorship and that is a slippery slope with only one likely outcome.  But educated users can at least see what they are doing when armed with knowledge.

When someone is pointing out hypocrisy, don't immediately assume the person pointing it out is advocating more bad behavior.   That is almost never the case!</div>
