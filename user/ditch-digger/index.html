    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Think of it this way.  I grew up in a place where there was a single race.  I didn't know racism because I didn't have any real life experience with it.  Then I moved to a diverse city where people are mashing up all the time.  They were already use to it and behaved in such a way.  Having what you think of bad shit happen to you repeatedly drives the point home.  Both sides have a majority of good people, but it only takes a couple of dip shits to ruin it for everybody.  I really do hope you never have to run across these idiots if you ever make it over here, but if you do then you will understand.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Yes Indians are racist, it's usually in the form of nepotism (promotion and hiring practices).  I can understand the why though.  In general east and west educational methods are different.  When the two meet people gently think the other is stupid.  west puts more emphasis on practical skills, east more on memorization.  Plus there are language problems that will get in the way of group cohesion, and small etiquette slights because of culture.  
</p>
<p>The really big one for east meets west that I've ran across is that west will argue with the customer to find better solutions to projects.  While east will give the customer exactly what they ask for.  As I'm western culture I've heard western customers get really mad about this.  I'm sure it goes the other way around and we come off as super rude to easterners.  And so it goes.</p></div>

Looked through there catalog, it appears to be relatively good.  You should email one of the professors and ask them where most of their students end up.  Most professors are fairly open and honest about their thoughts on if there school would be good to advance your goal, or if your goal is stupid.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Ok, well the school you go to matters.  It really depends on what you want to do.  Personally, I'm a cosc theorist in my head and I develop algorithms.  If your looking to make money, analytics is the goal you should shoot for (pick a school that trains we'll in databases, statistics, and business).  If you want to develop games, choose a school that has good professors for ai and theory.  In any event, java, c, and any other imperative languages are going the way of the dinosaur (they're still around because java is making a killing off of the jre).  Pick a school that will teach functional programming well.  If they don't have erlang or Haskell on the syllabus the school is probably crap.  In any event, welcome to a shit industry.</p></div>

I'm in the mid west pulling down 70k doing systems administration.  If I went to Cali and do what I'm doing now I would be pulling 120k, I'd have to live in an apartment instead of my home, I'd have a 45 min - 2 hour commute, and my savings at the end of the month would be far less.  
</p>
<p>The job is already stressful and if I didn't have student loans I'd be at another job.  
</p>
<p>Nobody will hire you if you don't have a piece of paper.  They don't care if you have the Mona Lisa of code in your portfolio, without a degree you can't get your foot in the door.</p>
<p>Then you'll have to deal with racism from Indians, ageism when you get older and the fire you early, and honestly all the crap email because your the only one who knows how to do anything.</p>
<p>Take my advice and become an electrician when you graduate.  You may be able to go into robotics if you're good at computers and electricity.  At least they'll treat you like a man instead of the guy they can't fire because nobody wants his job.</p></div>
