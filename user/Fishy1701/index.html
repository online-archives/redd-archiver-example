When you msg mods does every single mod review it or is it like a queue and if some mod marks something done anlther mod who logs on in 8 hours wont review the other mods responses to messages when.they were inactive? 

Anyway i found it rude and also strange it wanted me to go visit the new york times and read an interview? But also didnt provide a link? And why not just give me a copy pasta instead of asking me to search for answers on a 3rd party site??  And why ask me yo read the NY times?  It was a very strange response i got.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">But their accusations are false. Just plain wrong like when someone says two dudes is sick. Wrong - so either ignore and do your own thing or openly discuss and engage with them on why they are wrong. In the hope of changing some militant trans minds - the same way i try and change patriots/nationalists minds. Hiding away in own subs does nothing. For example i spent time on both thedonald and marchagainsttrump rathar than look for a sub that bashes and exludes them i enage rather than ignore. 

Maybe ive had my head in the sand for a few years but i thought trans hatred was mostly from the uneducated communities  - like the way hatred of gays was fuled through ignorance, religion ect. I also remember seeing a few posts that bi people get excluded or that some people wont date a bi person because of fear they will be dropped for the other sex / baby in 10 years. That sounds like peoples own fears manifesting but again thats a vocul minority of gays and lesbians right? 

So arnt the loud trans phobia accusers the same general idea - not the majority but the ones who upset, trigger / most upvotes so it seems like its not a big enough deal that it needed its own sub. Is there a r/imathiestbutithinkthatifgodexistshelovesfags . Think of someone who rants false accusations as one of those "god gates fags" sign people - equally ridiculous so just ignore or debate but exclusion and seems like it will create more problems.

Think young teens who find hate subs or 4chan can greatly effect and normalise racism, bigitory or nationslmism before they find themselves - what if a gay teen finds and spends time on the exclude trans sub?  Ends up thinking all trans like the way some idiots think all muslims are bad.

Thanks for explaining your perspective to me but i think there are long term risks associated with exclusion - by banning the anti trans sub all that will happrn to its users elsewhere is that some people might get accused of something they are not? (Phobic).  Its like the people from thedonald who go around other subs calling people traitors  they just look silly out of touch and uneducated and they are not that convincing so if a trans person calls out for being phobic then downvote or reply and say no thats not phobic if im not attracted.  To that picture.</div>

I dont understand why having a genital preference is transphobic? That sounds weird to me - does not liking a vaginas make me hetrogenitalphobic or femalebodyphobic - it just sounds silly and made up. 

Everyone likes what they like as long as its consensual and above legal age its gg. How can anyone much less someone from the (i cant believe im typing these letters since i didnt know it existed the l-g-b community) who themselves have faced judgement for liking the same genetilia why judge someone over what they like? 

As for the militant thing well you get that from people who are fanatic rick and morty fans ffs - nationalism, rascims ect so the fact that the trans community have a militant vocal minority should not be suprising, unique or something to judge them over- i dont judge americans by the loud trump suppotters for example.</div>

Will defo watch later - just watched the first 2/3 min.

Its the hypocrisy of the mods that really gets to me. Allowing one person to do something and not others. Redit admins dont seem to interested in holding them to any standard of fairness or human decency. 

In the future there will be no human mods except in the places like donald. All other forums, chats, comment sections and reddits will be done fairly without bias at incredibly fast speeds (almost instantaneously) by bots / GI (general intelligence - prefered term for AIs - we dont want to offend them ha)

Im also huge into boycots but obviously you cant put up users real world names however if you uncover that any of the questionable mods invest or own shares in any businesses i can add them to the blacklist.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I had to unsub from all the trek subs like trek and daystrum over a year ago because of the mods refusing to enforce spoiler bans - they would openly let people discus adds and trailers and previews, press releases and pictures from episodes one week in advance. If its unaired content its a fucking spoiler.

Terrible really because even if only 1/4 of people care about spoilers then the mods should have learned treks lessons of human decency and kindness.

They could litterly make everyone happy with some minor effort and consciously choose not to.

I dont know about the obsidian order but maybe something less cruel but definitely not up Starfleet or even klingon honour standards.

Edit: if anyone knows any smaller / kinder trek communities - even off reddit ones please post. I talked about discovery season 1 on reddit and it was the most excited i had been waiting for a week-week trek eps since s6 ds9 or late ENT.  Then i got things runined for me by people discussing sneak peeks.</div>

Just because he gets his way does not mean he walks away - if his interactions with the mods convinced even one of them to be more selective when banning people he has done a good thing snd possibly prevented someone else from being unjustly banned.

Also consider one of the mods is being abusive to him, now suppose in two years time that mod says or does something inappropriate on another reddit he moderates someone might remember his name and further question that mods behaviour. </div>
