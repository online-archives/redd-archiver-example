"I'm no friend of the Libertarian party. They're right-wing imbeciles who want to take away any and all regulations and call it freedom. The "libertarian" part of what I consider myself is more reflective on the amount of control a government should have and in what way, not the size.  
Before you criticize my view, I know this would be VERY difficult to achieve, but my ideal government would be one which has as much power as possible to stop oppression, whether that oppression is through businesses or individual people, with little power to prevent individuals from doing what they like as long as it doesn't harm anyone else - basically giving them UBI, healthcare, public transport, education, etc. and otherwise staying out of the way. In particular I want a focus on civics, free thought, media and financial literacy with the average person being given the freedom and mental headspace to take an interest in society at large to improve it. I believe that individuals, unhindered, tend to know best about their own situation and that the government should help them achieve their potential while letting them take the reins. Everyone's an artist until rent is due."</div>

Sure, Biden is fundamentally not socialist, but plenty of Marxists just want a collapse (though they won't say it) so they think not voting or voting for Trump will somehow end well for them. r/Socialism_101 was hijacked by Marxists and if you believe in free market socialism or anything less than the eventual ABOLITION OF CURRENCY, you aren't good enough for them (read their pinned post). I genuinely despise these anti-electoral do-nothing pricks with every fiber of my being for how needlessly-divisive and immature they are.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>  Being “anti-war” in this situation is just advocating for giving up in the face of aggression.

LEGIT!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm literally as pro-peace as they come but realize that some wars are caused by assholes invading places and we need to help. (Pro Ukraine aid because it's less expensive than letting Putin win, pro non-military aid for Gaza and Israel because people are literally dying of dehydration and starvation in the 21st century there)

MarxistMemes is full of a bunch of do-nothing, holier-than-thou fake "leftists" who give the whole movement a bad name and frankly disgust me. Same story with socialism\_101. Genuinely LOOK at their pinned post to see the kinds of clowns they are. They're literally green MAGA.</div>
