[Are you just asking having never watched the videos?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iryQSpxSlrg)

^ He's not the aggressor here you moron.

As I said before, there's not a ton of video of the first shooting, but there is video of people chasing him and throwing shit at him - looks a lot like the one I linked above.</div>

Someone tried to grab his gun, hit him with a skateboard, and pointed a pistol at him.

Those were the people he shot.

He's 17 and it's legal for him to carry a gun in the state (usually associated with hunting).

He's not able to buy it himself.

Imagine defending the adults attacking a minor.

You're a complete POS; upset that a minor wasn't victimized.</div>

No different than saying a home owner should have left their house instead of defend it to keep the criminals alive.

We don't blame people for getting attacked because they happen to be in around shitty people and we certainly don't condemn them for defending themselves.

Three people attacked a man with a gun and lost - that's what happened.

We have case-closed clear footage of 2 incidents. The only one with any questions is the first incident.

If you flip a coin 10 times and get tails every time, that doesn't mean you're going to get tails the next time you flip it.

Even if Chauvin got off without protests, it would've saved 20+ lives - it would be a net win for the people who died.

Vigilantism is a bad policy - looting and rioting is a bad policy. 

If you can't have protests without the former then you shouldn't protest.

This is just an awful argument from every angle.

Firstly, America is only 245 years old - lol.

Secondly, you can't just pretend you have any idea what would've happened on an alternate time line where 100 less tvs were stolen.

We have no idea what the outcome of the case would have been if people hadn't spent 8 months looting their local Walmart, but 20+ people died during the "mostly peaceful protests" that would still be alive today if they hadn't happened.

Is that an "acceptable cost" to you or are you intelligent enough to realize what a bad policy this is?

In what world is yelling "eat shit" at a resturaunt "holding someone accountable?"

And accountable for what? We have an entire legal system designed to hold people accountable.

You openly admit that he hasn't done anything illegal by saying immediately below, "*for that to happen laws need to change[.]*"

What laws? Free speech laws?

Name a law that needs to change to "hold Alex Jones accountable."

Hard not to sound like you're the bad guy in my opinion.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The video they posted starts after they'd been chanting at him.

This was in the article I cited: https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/A-bunch-of-cowards-Alex-Jones-filmed-loudly-13720836.php#photo-17132948

&gt;He said they sat at a table inside when several people from the outside dining area approached him. He claimed they told him to "eat sh--" and that "we're going to get you."

&gt;Jones said he tried to get a manager to stop them, but things eventually calmed down.

&gt;Later, Jones said customers were staring at him as he walked out to leave. 

&gt;**In a video Jones took on his cellphone, the patrons can be heard chanting, "This is class war. Eat the rich and feed the poor."**

&gt;The video sent to EchoplexMedia.com appears to start moments after that chant. That's when Jones started yelling.

&gt;"You're the one telling people to eat sh--," he tells one man. "You ain't nothing boy."</div>

Shouting "EaT tHe RiCh!" and yelling "*We're gonna get you Alex Jones!*" does a lot less than someone rational calmly disagreeing with you.

And I certainly wouldn't do it while he's out at dinner with his wife. I wouldn't want someone to walk up to my table and say, "*hey, I've seen your reddit comments and I disagree with you,*" while I'm trying to eat steak.</div>

That's not how you help - all you're doing is hatemongering - that was my point.

You don't fight hate with hate - that's not how you make the world a better place.

That was the "misinformation" I spread.

I don't follow Alex Jones, but being stupid isn't criminal. We as a society shouldn't condone harassing people who we disagree with randomly on the streets. This was happening with MAGA hats, with BLM shirts, with random political disagreements, etc.</div>

**[They banned me for "spreadinf misinformation is not permitted."](https://i.imgur.com/1LD7dTC.jpg)**

---

As the camera pans right, you realize that Alex Jones is the most normal looking person in this video.

And yeah, I'm gonna side with him here because even though he's clearly upset, a group of fat, pink-haired... people... are randomly harassing him at a restaurant.

Don't act like you do on twitter in real life - it's not cool.

---

You're free to dislike anybody you want (hate is a poison itself), but when you start harassing people you disagree with in public, you're being a bigot and that makes you the bad guy.

---

Bigotry is defined as "*intolerance towards those who hold a different opinion from oneself.*"

It's textbook bigotry.

It's worth noting that language is being changed - this word was no exception as people like me kept calling the actual bigots out.

[This is what bigotry's definition was a year ago.](https://www.quora.com/Bigotry-is-defined-as-intolerance-toward-those-who-hold-different-opinions-from-oneself-Do-you-see-all-bigotry-as-being-on-one-side-of-the-political-line-or-is-it-evenly-distributed)

---

&gt;if ya don’t know that then you’re a right dumb cunt.

Complete lack of self awareness; loving the irony.

---

As I implied earlier, you shouldn't "hate" anybody.

Hate is useless; all it does is poison you (*as you can see from the way you speak to people who disagree with you, "ya dumb cunt"*).

There's never a reason to hate a person. You can seek justice for criminals without hate; you can refute an argument without hate, etc.

Hate is a poison and you should stop bathing in it.

---

A restaurant is never the time or place to shout your political opinions at public figures; it's not the time to yell "fuck you!" or to engage in hatemongering.

As I said before, hatemongering is *always* a waste of time.

I disagree with a lot of public figures, but I would never in a million years shout at them if I saw them out and about in public; I wouldn't do that to anyone.

There's no point in doing that, ever.

There's no point in spouting off at someone wearing a Maga hat, or BLM shirt, or pride shirt, or etc. etc. etc.

All this does is create unhealthy discourse in our society.

If you want to do something positive, fight against big-tech censoring political discussion on the platforms that people like you and I use to discuss these topics every day; where you're free to click "block" if you're tired of speaking to me. It's really that easy - we don't have to scream at each other in a Chili's ffs.

And regardless of whatever Alex Jones said that was stupid (I never paid any attention to him either), he was censored by every major social network simultaneously; that should be opposed in and of itself.

---

&gt;Are you saying if you overheard a person spouting vile racist shit that you wouldn’t speak up?

He was eating at a restaurant dude; he wasn't sitting in there hosting his show FFS.

---

&gt;Addressing the incident in a recent Infowars episode, Jones said he had been eating at a local steakhouse with his wife and Joe Rogan, an MMA color commentator and comedian.

&gt;Jones said his wife wasn't satisfied with dinner, so they ended up stopping at Lucy's.

&gt;"We've been going for many years," he said. "It's a great place."

&gt;He said they sat at a table inside when several people from the outside dining area approached him. He claimed they told him to "eat sh--" and that "we're going to get you."

&gt;Jones said he tried to get a manager to stop them, but things eventually calmed down.

&gt;Later, Jones said customers were staring at him as he walked out to leave. In a video Jones took on his cellphone, the patrons can be heard chanting, "This is class war. Eat the rich and feed the poor."

&gt;The video sent to EchoplexMedia.com appears to start moments after that chant. That's when Jones started yelling.

Well the other people didn't give their side of the story anywhere I can find; I'm happy to hear it, but simply assuming a person is lying automatically is just that: a supposition.

It's not that outlandish to hear that a bunch of pink-haired austinites were harassing Alex Jones and shouting "eat the rich!" I find that very easy to believe.

---

Here you openly admit that you're a hatemonger (*a person who kindles hatred, enmity, or prejudice in others*).

Congratulations, you have become the thing you claim to oppose.

---

&gt;speech that can harm people

Literally impossible.

And yet...

&gt;Fuck you’re a sanctimonious cunt. Fuck off ya right wing troll.

The self awareness of a potato.</div>

I am used to comments getting shadow-deleted for ??? reasons so I try to repost and figure out what I said wrong in case I got caught in an auto filter.

It's hard to tell if it was deleted by a person or automod because I post and come back 20 minutes later and it's gone... then I post again and it goes through.

In this case I edited my repost to say, "My comment was reinstated below" with a link and (I guess) automod removed that one too (which had more upvotes).

What doesn't make any sense is a mod getting mad at me for mentioning that my comment was censored when I have no idea why it happened in the first place.

I mean, I don't mind them getting annoyed, but then censoring all my comments because I complained about my comments being censored? Banning me...?

Then stalking me into the RedditCensors sub to "add context" after muting me?

Just... why?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't have any messages from you - just a ban with no reply.

You muted me and then stalked me here to "give more context" also?

Look, I'm happy to have a conversation with you about the ban, but lashing out at me because your automod made a mistake is absolutely ridiculous.

Let's recap what happened:

---

1. You "accidentally censored my comment" - oops, you made a mistake.

2. I noticed, messaged you about it, didn't receive a response, so posted another comment with links removed.

3. You showed back up, reviewed my comment, recognized your mistake

4. And then got mad at me for pointing out that my comment was shadow-deleted and banned me?

5. Then you stalked me to this post to "give more context"? 🙄

How is mentioning that my comment was censored (**when it was**) "being petulant?"

It's crazy how you guys power trip - this is probably the best example of it I've seen.

**Edit: Unbelievable... mod stalked me here to "give context" and then deleted their comment. What a trip.**

Out of respect for their privacy, I won't post their name, but [here's the "context" they gave](https://i.imgur.com/mxTn55U.png) (this never showed up in my inbox).

"*We're going to censor you because we accidentally censored you and you pointed it out.*"

Crazy!</div>
