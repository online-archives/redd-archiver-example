    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It's a good question why JS (or variation of its syntax) is being offered in Unity and GNOME as an option in the first place. Perhaps indie developers loves it ... perhaps it somehow communicate ease and familiarity. I don't know. In either case, JS is strong, even without these things, and without Node, just by the fact that it's client side technology for the web. Even if we would have suitable replacement right now, available in all newest versions of all mayor browsers, it would still take quite some time for JS to become marginalized. But, this is clearly not the case, quite the opposite - ES6 is coming and there's a lot of hype about it.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people, including some in the Unity corporation, like to call UnityScript by the name &quot;JavaScript.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess they just wanted to be clear that UnityScript is syntactically so similar to JS, that a JS developer would not have problems learning it. I guess that's part of their marketing.</p>
<p>This also in a way reminds me of GJS (<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell/Gjs_StyleGuide">https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell/Gjs_StyleGuide</a>). The fact that these project which could go with any language decided to use JS or create something that's syntactically almost identical to JS speaks of it's popularity, and surly means JS is here to stay for quite some time.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I agree with some parts of the article, especially about current JS frameworks situation, which is a massive pile of mess and delusion, but...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside from the little “indie” games you find in app stores and mobiles, no self-respecting game developer is using JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think JS, among other languages, is one of the options in Unity. That does no mean game will be interpreted by V8, of course that would be slow, code will be complied; so, the idea is, you can use JS syntax, if that's something you're more familiar with, without a mayor loss in performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, since JS is the only language native to web browsers, any web project in any language must have some JS code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, that's the indication that there indeed will be and are many jobs available on this field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Redmonk proves that the web is popular, not that JS is popular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My dear, these two are intimately tight together. You have kind of a contradiction here. Of course if it wouldn't be for web, JS wouldn't be popular. Duh! But web took off and with it, JS, no matter of its state. We could, in same manner, say HTML and CSS are broken. We could even say Google had no perspective, I mean, who cares about a white page with a single input field on it? But, everything that got stick to web, got immensely popular. JS just fall into this category.</p></div>

<p>GNOME as an organization has serious problems as well; aside from its questionable design practices, it also seems to be more interested in using its funds to promote pet political projects rather than write the code those funds were donated for in the first place, and as such I question its ability to sustain itself, since I don't think too many people are going to be opening their wallets again after that little stunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, this indeed is a very sad and unfortunate reality of GNOME right now. Quality people who'd actually contribute to the project start leaving (or are even asked to leave) due to political disagreements or lack of funds. It's downward spiral from there on. Quality of product start dropping, more political bullshit is pushed, strange and damaging business models are adopted to replace lost founds, which result in more damage. Soon project is dead. Just look at the sad state of Mozilla right now.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Oh, we had one (the only) female in my class. Professors literally said: &quot;we'll let her pass, because we don't get much girls&quot;. We were doing Pascal the first year. Code, the only code in that whole year that she submitted was <code>Program Hello;</code> and she did not just passed, she passed with a good grade. I don't know what happened the next year, because I was gone.</p>
<p>But, oh my, how dispassionate, even hateful her attitude was. And entitled, and not ashamed of her special treatment at all. I can't imagine why she enrolled at all, perhaps she knew that that school goes easy on girls. Horrifying to imagine she'd finish her education (I mean, that they let her pass all the way to the end), and then seek work in this field, and be hired because of some quotas or something.</p></div>
