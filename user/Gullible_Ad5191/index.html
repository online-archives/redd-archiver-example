    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Dude... It's like saying that we are going to demiliterize Germany and remove the NAZI party from power; open a war tribunal and prosecute NAZI collaborators. Which is what we actually did do.

Hamas didn't just drop from the sky. UNRA knowingly funded them and the militarization of Gaza City for many years as they planed this attack. Hamas is just another organisation like any other that had zero difficulty recruiting employees from the general population.

And don't give me that history and politics crap. The same day Israel was reinstated everyone in the entire region started a military campaign to drive them into the sea. Since before they existed until now their behaviour has been identical but somehow you require me to believe that Israel's actions gradually made them this way? What, did Israel build a time machine, go back before they were reinstated and invent the Palestinian identity?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No. You are a racist. You stole their land first and then tried to revised history. You committed genocide against everyone who was there before you and then complained about it when one group of people in the entire subcontinent found the strength to resist you. You never stopped trying to implement genocide this entire time. And then when someone took steps to bring you to justice you started winging about it. You sound exactly like Hitler.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No. There are people who support the Israeli defence strategy.

There are also plenty of people opposed to their defense strategy but none of them are personally volunteering to conduct "altra-precise high Intel" military operations to provide a concise victory against HAMAS so their armchair opinions are pretty much worthless at best. At worst they are wallpapering over their HAMAS support with empty platitudes. As is the UNRA.</div>

Your people rejected that and chose apartheid precisely because a system with two sovereign states would be a politically stable and humane solution that would fail to facilitate genocide of the Jews.

Endorsing a one state solution without an apartheid between Israel and Hamas is the same as endorsing the same arrangement between Israel and Nazi Germany. You are literally pro-genocide with only a wallpapering humane platitudes.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Kinda reminds me of the headline being reposted around Reddit: "Florida's dean of medicine was banned from Twitter for misinformation after he linked results of a scientific study into COVID vaccines."

The majority of Redditors just respond "hahaha Florida dumb..." They don't even for one second consider the possibility that the dean of medicine might know more than a twitter employee. They don't stop to question how providing a link to official research papers could be construed as "misinformation" when a link itself makes no claims. They certainly have zero interest in looking into the credibility of the research paper in question.

The Irony is that Twitter has now been bought out by their arch nemesis Elon Musk... So now what? Is the word of twitter censors still the infallible word of God? Or are they finally willing to admit that they are subject to corporate interests now that they personally hate the CEO?</div>
