People need to realize that this website, despite how it presents itself, isn't some digital beacon of morality. It was designed from the ground up to cater to advertisement money.

The admins are all few in number and overworked. They simply don't have the time or care to help. Moderator accounts will always have preferential treatment over normal users. They don't review the evidence or take context into their judgements, they probably have a set of guidelines they follow which allows them to quickly pass judgement. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I hate to say it, but actual intelligent debate died a long time ago on reddit. Probably about 9 years ago I could have a debate with center-left libertarian types on /r/politics and others. I actually learned a lot from them. 

Nowadays politics aren't debated on reddit with the exception of a few heavily moderated subs. What actually happens is users try to prove that their "opponent" is their moral inferior, or a bigot of some form, or what ever other undesirable label. 

I used to talk about politics on a lot of subs. I have come to realize that it's just not possible to convince anybody of anything on reddit since users will stubbornly stay their ground and try to do anything possible to make themselves look correct. Not prove anything about their world view. Make themselves look correct. 

Therefor just pick a sub that you agree with and lurk. Don't comment. It's the best way to do politics on reddit.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I've been using reddit on a nearly daily basis for the better part of a decade (despite the age of this account) and I remember him. He, and this promise, are why I started in the first place. I can understand removing really extreme subs like /r/niggers or ones that post content that can get reddit into legal trouble. I never expected this site to have absolute free speech.

But it's so obvious that far-left ideology has seeped into high places that it's starting to become accepted as the obvious moral high ground and anybody else is a cryptofascist who needs to be shut down immediately. 

So basically, I miss Aaron and I miss the old reddit. The only reason I am still here is because there aren't any good competitors with the userbase. I'll just wait for the mass exodus of reddit to occur just like I did with Digg, and before that Myspace.
