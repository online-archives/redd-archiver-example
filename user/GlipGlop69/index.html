    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Quite frankly, you should change your attitude towards ADHD meds.

No, I never will. And you're right, I have plenty of experience with the meds and am wholly opposed to their effects. I had them forced on me as a kid my entire time in school and they quite literally made me a zombie. I hate the meds and I think they're a crutch. After I was old enough to make my own decisions I ditched them and never looked back. My life is so much better having learned how to cope with ADHD through corrective behavior rather than with amphetamines. 

&gt;And if the wrong person sees someone like you talk about how meds make you feel, they may be deterred from trying them, and that's dangerous.

I'm not responsible for the decisions somebody else makes. That's the argument used against freedom of speech and you should know better given the sub you're in right now.

I understand for some people my way of living with ADHD isn't an option but most of what I read in that sub is just people finding any excuse to apply victimhood to themselves to then build an entire identity around that victimhood. It's a lifestyle of self-defeat and that's much more destructive than any of my opinions could ever be.</div>
