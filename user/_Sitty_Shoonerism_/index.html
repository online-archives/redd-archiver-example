There's scientific proof that certain people groups have genetic differences when it comes to performance, I'm sure you would even acknowledge this if you weren't currently hiding from an argument. But of course that'll never change. You'll hide from the facts and say "RACIST!! NEVER LET THEM SPEAK!!" Now go put your head back in the sand. </div>

quit using the word superior if one race commits less crime due to genetics. It's incredibly transparent why you're doing that. 

Do you think it's a scientific fact people with autism on average have lower IQ? Well I guess that makes you a supremacist because if someone said that about a particular race you'd call them a supremacist. </div>

"Whites" being your go to race proves you obviously don't care about finding answers. You just want to call people white supremacists. 

My argument is that there's very weak arguments explaining why there's a crime rate disparity and if someone points this out you don't have the right to call them racists. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; ...because frankly there are much fewer poor white communities. It's an ignorant fucking question, not a rational argument.

Wrong. Same number different percentage of the total. 1% of 100 is the same as 10% of 10 etc. The rate of poor white communities is smaller but the quantity is the same. Hence "much fewer poor white communities" is wrong. 

This link shows children living in poverty, which of course is a great way to fast track yourself to a life of crime. The numbers in the US are the same for white children and black children:
http://www.nccp.org/media/releases/release_34.html

And the "communities segregated into poverty" is irrelevant because Latinos face the same problem and their crime numbers are less. 

You need to throw out the poverty argument. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's very difficult to trace the data back to the answer. I remember one study where they observed seatbelt usage in a state where individuals can only be pulled over for speeding. Observers with police took notes and realized black people wear seat belts less than other races. So that's at least one small proof there can be race based disparity. 

Also the number of times police draw their guns per number of arrests is the same between blacks and other races, showing police don't have higher aggression tendencies towards blacks.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If I remember correctly the Byzantine Empire was devastated from fighting other wars and knew for certain it was only a matter of time before the Turks decided to join in and decimate them. It's what the Turks had been on-again off-again doing for 300 years prior so it was a no brainer what was going to happen. Hence the first crusade was a preemptive strike and was mostly a failure. 

The 2nd crusade was to retake Jerusalem and in that one an army of 10k crusaders got unnecessarily/brutally violent and that's where the whole stigma of the crusades comes from. The army had a similar mentality of the US in WWII when we dropped an atomic bomb on a civilian population and killed 100k civilians: they started the fight by violently taking the holy land so send a message to end the fight once and for all. Their actions where still condemned at the time by the nations who sent them though. 

The other ~7 crusades were pretty much no big deal as they were justified "tit for tat" campaigns and "humane"

It's dishonest to compare the crusades with Islamic violence. There's vast differences in violence and valid justifications for conflict.  

There's some pretty good summaries around reddit if you look for them. </div>
