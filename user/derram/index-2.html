<p>The best outsourcers fire themselves • The Register </p>

<p>'My rule of thumb, then, with outsourcing software development, is to ask the outsourcer what their plan to fire themselves is. ', &quot;Commonly, a friend told me as I was sailing slices of rare steak through L'Entrecôte’s green sauce, outsourced projects boomerang back to the in-house staff.&quot; </p>
<p>'In the same analysis, Fersht suggests that there’s a ray of light for outsourcers if they, themselves, can only transform. ' </p>
<p>'Bringing in outsourcers is proof that the organisation already mistrusted its in-house IT. Inevitably, the usual causes of failure - ever changing requirements, overly ambitious deadlines and budgets, etc - will plague the outsourcers’ efforts. ' </p>
<p>'The outsourcer is wonderful, sure, but we need to make sure it holds up their end of the bargain. '</p>

<p>'Essentially, the machine code can be decompiled back into a C-like language, and then traced back to known programmers using machine-learning algorithms. ' </p>
<p>'They still managed 88 per cent accuracy in identifying authors. ' </p>
<p>'The technique can help identify virus makers as well as unmask the creators of anti-censorship tools and other outlawed programs. ' </p>

<p>' &quot;Randomized pseudonyms with randomized code and malware (unless a malware author is planning to share only one code sample with the entire world), as well as the above methods is a starting step.&quot; ®'</p>

<p>'Research &quot;Agile development&quot; can mean different things to different people. ', &quot;If you work in and around software development, we'd be surprised if you weren't experiencing pressure to produce new releases and roll-out change-requests faster than ever before.&quot;, &quot;To some it's about easing up on traditional rigour, and even legitimising a quick-and-dirty approach to getting stuff out of the door.&quot;, &quot;The one thing few dispute in all this is the 'constantly changing demands' bit.&quot;, &quot;While many indicate they know what they should be doing, they clearly aren't acting on that insight.&quot;</p>

<p>Sphero spinoff Misty Robotics launches a robot for programmers  |  TechCrunch </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Recent Sphero spinoff Misty Robotics brought a decidedly non-consumer-focused device to the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas this week. ' </p>
<p>'Bernstein walks us through some of the quick and dirty features early developers have programmed in at a recent hackathon. ' </p>
<p>'An early attempt at that will arrive later this year, in the form of Misty II, a more highly polished and commercially minded version of the company’s robotic’s platform. ' </p>
<p>'The robot fills a similar role as Willow Garage’s bygone Turtlebot or iRobot’s Create, offering developers a way to build ideas on a robotics platform. ' </p>
<p>'The Misty I Developer Edition is the first baby step for a startup with even grander ambitions than the one that gave birth to it. '</p>

<p>Gamasutra - Game Design Deep Dive: Creating believable crowds in Planet Coaster </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Requests for changes to the path system throughout development were little to no work to integrate with the crowd system. ' </p>
<p>'By this time the path system prototype’s development had finished and we had chosen a crowd system to go with. ' </p>
<p>'I think the best way to imagine how a flow simulation works is to picture a table with raised edges. ' </p>
<p>'Most recently I worked on the crowd simulation in Planet Coaster. ' </p>
<p>'We reviewed the state of the art in relation to crowd simulation and navigation. '</p>

<p>'Dabblers with prominent artificial intelligence tools have been warned and/or reminded to check their dependencies because some have open vulnerabilities. ' </p>
<p>'That will still be enough to make trouble for some who charge ahead with AI experiments without first considering security. ®' </p>
<p>'Caffe also builds with vulnerable builds of the image manipulation library, and the image viewer. ' </p>
<p>'The largest number of bugs were found in the Open Source Computer Vision ( ) code base: eleven CVEs in all, exploitable across all three attack classes. was found to be present in both Caffe and Torch. ' </p>
<p>'They found quite a few and wrote that the frameworks are susceptible to denial-of-service, evasion attacks, or system compromise. ' </p>

<p>'Of course, software production didn’t change radically into the component utopia that the academics had envisaged. ' </p>
<p>'Deep in the mists of time, some 25 to 30 years ago, there was a belief that software production would change radically. ' </p>
<p>'Software production would radically change, the experts predicted, so developers would be producing Lego-like components. ' </p>
<p>'More O-O techniques found their way in but the basic model didn’t change. ' </p>
<p>'This was a cost the academics and theoreticians of software production hadn’t calculated. ' </p>

<p>'Lightbend does include Java APIs, and the Play framework in particular has a significant Java developer following as well. ' </p>
<p>'Use of Wildfly Swarm as the delivery vehicle keeps MicroProfile microservices light. ', &quot;Java is once again moving with the times, which is handy for everybody out there in possession of Java skills in today's cloudy, DevOpsy and composable infrastructure-defined world.&quot; </p>

<p>Q. Why's Oracle so two-faced over open source? A. Moolah, wonga, dosh • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'We don't have to fight open source, we have to exploit open source.&quot;' </p>
<p>'To the extent that Oracle embraces open source, therefore it does so for financial reward, just like every other corporation. ' </p>
<p>'But look for a single line in its response to the Trump executive order that signals &quot;open source is bad&quot;. ' </p>
<p>'Oracle loves open source. ' </p>
<p>'It can compete at the product level while embracing open source at the project level, which helps fuel its overall product and business strategy. ' </p>

</blockquote>
<p>'Close that security hole on iOS 11 by going to Settings &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Location Services &gt;&gt; Camera. ' </p>
<p>'Can’t someone simply wander through those images, stalking you via a breadcrumb trail of EXIF location data?', &quot;We’re leaking location data everywhere, and it's time to fix it by design.&quot; </p>
<p>'On Android YMMV but try Settings &gt;&gt; Apps &gt;&gt; Camera &gt;&gt; App Permissions &gt;&gt; Location. ' </p>
<p>'The reason is that most people have no idea that every photo they take with their phone embeds location data in the exchangeable image file format (EXIF) metadata that describes each snap. ' </p>

<p>Java security plagued by crappy docs, complex APIs, bad advice • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'They looked at common concerns related to secure Java coding, common development challenges, and common security vulnerabilities. ' </p>
<p>'The researchers had nothing nice to say about Spring, which accounted for 55 per cent of the Java security implementation questions that were analyzed. ' </p>
<p>'Stack Overflow answers also recommended trusting all SSL/TLS certificates to bypass cert verification errors, even though this disables SSL security checks. ' </p>
<p>'And they found that many of the answers endorsed by the Stack Overflow community led to insecure code. ' </p>
<p>'The paper recommends that developers spend more time testing security features, avoid disabling security checks, and exercise caution with community answers. ' </p>

<p>Facebook U-turn: React, other libraries freed from unloved patent license • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Wolff said while Facebook continues to believe its BSD + Patents license has benefits, &quot;we acknowledge that we failed to decisively convince this community.&quot;', &quot;Wolff said Facebook considered a license change for its other open-source projects, but wasn't ready to commit to anything.&quot; </p>
<p>'Under the terms of its BSD + Patents license, Facebook will revoke its grant to use patented technology tied to its software for any offensive patent lawsuit against Facebook, or its customers, for using Facebook products. ' </p>
<p>'Some projects, he said, will keep the BSD + Patents license. ' </p>
<p>'Faced with growing dissatisfaction about licensing requirements for some of its open-source projects, Facebook today said it will move React, Jest, Flow, and Immutable.js under the MIT license next week. ' </p>

<p>WordPress has adverse reaction to Facebook's React.js licence • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Automattic, the company behind hosting service WordPress.com, has decided to stop using Facebook's React.js library, citing legal concerns.&quot;, &quot;That specification concerns Facebook's own patents and is designed to protect The Social Network™ from what it sees as “meritless patent litigation”.&quot; </p>
<p>' It’s their fight.” ®Sponsored: The Joy and Pain of Buying IT - Have Your Say', &quot;WordPress' founding developer Matt Mullenweg – who also founded WordPress.com – explains the decision by noting that Automattic has used React since 2015, when it put the code to work in the “Calypso” update of Wordpress.com that emerged in 2016.&quot;, &quot;At the time, WordPress.com's legal people felt there was no problem with React and developers liked it so much they planned to use it again in another big update called Gutenberg.&quot; </p>

<p>'On the flat design, users spend more time lingering on the caption &quot;3 Year Pearl&quot; than they do reading about the 3 Year Pearl. ' </p>
<p>'&quot;Since this experiment used targeted findability tasks, more time and effort spent looking around the page are not good. ' </p>
<p>'A &quot;flat&quot; design removes the distinction between navigation controls and content. ' </p>
<p>'&quot;On average participants spent 22 per cent more time (i.e. slower task performance) looking at the pages with weak signifiers,&quot; the firm notes. ' </p>
<p>'Once blessed by Apple, flat designs spread to electronic programme guides on telly, games consoles and even car interfaces. ' </p>

<p>&quot;It's more than just a handy resource or meeting ground for distressed tech professionals, it's a form of default documentation for programming technologies.&quot; </p>
<p>'This week, Stack Overflow data scientist David Robinson published an interesting observation: There exists a small but meaningful divide between the programming technologies used in wealthy countries and those used in developing countries. ' </p>
<p>'As a result, the site has access to all kinds of interesting data on coding trends, emerging technologies, etc. ' </p>
<p>' Software development likes to imagine itself as a uniquely egalitarian white-collar trade, but skillsets follow education and education follows money. ' </p>
<p>'PHP is itself skewed toward lower-income countries, but CodeIgniter is deep. ' </p>

<p>'From a dedicated website, interviewers can test candidates in seven programing languages over Skype using a real-time code editor. ' </p>
<p>'Skype recently introduced a feature designed to cement its place among business users who aren’t as interested in things like emoji reactions or “Stories.” It now supports conducting technical interviews via its service through a new Skype Interviews feature. ' </p>
<p>'Meanwhile, the in-browser code editor lets candidates runs their code and check results, and it includes real-time inline syntax highlighting to help them catch mistakes. ' </p>
<p>'Instead, the interviewer just visits the Skype Interviews website and clicks “Start Interview” to begin. ' </p>

<p>Facebook won't change React.js license despite Apache developer pain • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Facebook's decided to stick with its preferred version of the BSD license despite the Apache Foundation sin-binning it for any future projects.&quot;, &quot;The Foundation barred use of Facebook's BSD-plus-Patents license in July, placing it in the “Category X” it reserves for “disallowed licenses”.&quot;, &quot;Developers who didn't fancy that work therefore kicked off a GitHub thread calling for Facebook to change React's licence.&quot; </p>
<p>' We think changing our approach would inhibit our ability to continue releasing meaningful open source software and increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits.” ®Sponsored: The Joy and Pain of Buying IT - Have Your Say', &quot;But despite describing the situation developers face as “painful”, Facebook's engineering director Adam Wolff has explained that The Social Network™ won't be changing anything.&quot; </p>

<p>The future of Python: Concurrency devoured, Node.js next on menu • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'Last December, Python version 3.6 arrived, bringing with it non-provisional support for the asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4. ' </p>
<p>'Now that almost all the popular Python packages have been ported to Python 3, doubts about the language have receded into the background. ', &quot;Python and JavaScript are widely used in part because they're easier to pick up than Java, C, C++, and C#.&quot; </p>
<p>'Since 2008, the Python community has tried to reconcile incompatibility between Python 2 and newly introduced Python 3. ', &quot;For years, adoption of Python 3 was slow and some even dared to suggest Python didn't have a future.&quot; </p>

<p>'Kite makes a Python programming plugin, called Kite, for various code editors to boost developer productivity through automatic code completion and other enhancements. ', &quot;Kite's troubles stem from its involvement with two popular open-source projects, autocomplete-python and Minimap, used with the Atom code editor.&quot;, &quot;Essentially, it's claimed Kite engineers pushed code into autocomplete-python that shoved aside a rival autocomplete engine to promote Kite.&quot; </p>
<p>'The Kite installer can be seen when an Atom user attempts to install autocomplete-python from within the editor. ' </p>
<p>'The former is a widely used autocompletion engine for Python code, and the latter is a plugin that provides a zoomed-out view of code for easier navigation. ' </p>

<p>Atlassian hikes prices for most cloudy JIRA and Confluence users • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you were one of those who asked for it, here's what you're getting: for monthly users, Atlassian currently offers flat prices for organisations with more than 10 users and seven tiers.&quot; </p>
<p>'The new tiers mean that you pay the same price for users 11-100, then the same price for users 101-250 and so on up the tiers, rather than the lowest applicable rate for all users. ', &quot;There's some silver lining in this cloud, as JIRA Service Desk prices are also going down for all users and pricing for the 1-10 user tier of other products remains unchanged.&quot;, &quot; Atlassian thinks those customers won't have trouble swallowing the change: its announcement of the hike says “We fundamentally believe that even with these price changes, we're still the value leader in the market.”. ®&quot;, &quot;Sean Regan, the company's head of product marketing for JIRA, told The Register the change is the first in six years, during which time Atlassian has added numerous features and increased its R&amp;D spend.&quot; </p>

<p>'This is the same process that happened with the commission’s proposal to kill the 2015 net neutrality rules. ' </p>

<p>'Accidental hero' halts ransomware attack and warns: this is not over | Technology | The Guardian </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'The “accidental hero” who halted the global spread of an unprecedented ransomware attack by registering a garbled domain name hidden in the malware has warned the attack could be rebooted. ' </p>
<p>'Enable windows update, update and then reboot.”He said he got his first job out of school without any real qualifications, having skipped university to start up a tech blog and write software.“It’s always been a hobby to me, I’m self-taught. ' </p>
<p>'Microsoft released a patch (a software update that fixes the problem) for the flaw in March, but computers that have not installed the security update remain vulnerable. ' </p>
<p>'So I picked it up not knowing what it did at the time.”The kill switch was hardcoded into the malware in case the creator wanted to stop it spreading. ' </p>
<p>'Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a user’s data, then demands payment in exchange for unlocking the data. ' </p>

<p>Police watchdog investigates illegal outsourced Indian hackers scandal • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;The UK's Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating claims that the Metropolitan Police used outsourced Indian hackers to illegally access the email accounts of Guardian journalists and environmental campaigners.&quot; </p>
<p>'It will also examine if any officers within NDEDIU used any information gained from this contact if it took place,” said the IPCC in a statement today. ' </p>
<p>'Police employees at the National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit were alleged by the whistle-blower to have illegally accessed the email accounts of 10 named people and the whistleblower supplied their passwords. ' </p>
<p>'These included environmentalists and two Guardian journalists.“The IPCC’s investigation is looking at whether officers from NDEDIU contacted Indian counterparts and if the services of computer hackers in India were obtained to access email accounts. ' </p>
<p>'He and other environmentalist victims, including one Cat Dorey, have minor criminal records related to their protesting. ' </p>

<p>Microsoft's .NET-mare for developers: ASP.NET Core 2.0 won't work on Windows-only .NET • The Register </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'The difficulty is that although .NET Core generally performs better than .NET Framework, it is not as mature, and many existing .NET libraries do not work. ' </p>
<p>'Workarounds are available in some cases, such as calling into libraries compiled for .NET Framework from .NET Core, but this does not always work. ' </p>
<p>'Build Microsoft has made a change to its forthcoming ASP.NET Core 2.0 web framework so that it is now incompatible with the Windows-only .NET Framework, causing confusion and annoyance for some .NET developers. ', &quot;Microsoft's primary developer event, Build 2017, is running this week in Seattle, US, and you can be sure that the future of .NET and .NET Core will be a topic of intense discussion. ®&quot; </p>
<p>'Edwards adds that ASP.NET Core 1.0 will be supported for an extended period to allow more time to port to the next version. ' </p>

<p>'Modern programming languages are qualitatively different from their predecessors, but we are only beginning to realize the implications of that difference. ' </p>
<p>'The power of modern programming languages is that they are expressive, readable, concise, precise, and executable. ' </p>
<p>'As an example, Figure 1 shows the breadth first search (BFS) algorithm expressed in the pseudocode used in a popular textbook. ' </p>
<p>'The authors designed this language to be more concise and readable than most programming languages at the time, which was 1989. ' </p>
<p>'Programming used to be about translation: expressing ideas in natural language, working with them in math notation, then writing flowcharts and pseudocode, and finally writing a program. ' </p>

<p>'Outsourcers are to blame for causing major disruptions at one in three major UK companies over the last three years, according to research by consultancy firm Deloitte. ' </p>
<p>'The global survey, which included the responses of 107 UK companies across different sectors, also found that 80 per cent of UK companies are dependent on outsourcers for operations – the highest proportion in any country. ' </p>
<p>'Deloitte estimates that most large organisations take between two to three years to develop a framework for better managing risk. ' </p>
<p>'But many companies and government organisations continue to outsource at speed, despite the associated risks. ' </p>
<p>'Just 11 per cent said they feel equipped to deal with such failures during times of uncertainty. ' </p>

<p>'So Microsoft set about adapting Git to work better with massive code repositories. ' </p>
<p>'To lighten the burden of massive Git source code repositories, Microsoft has created a virtualized file system that allows developers to interact with large codebases without sending excessive amounts of data across the network. ' </p>
<p>'Git (when not applied to people or animals) refers to a distributed version control system for managing software code. ' </p>
<p>'GVFS helps not only with large repositories, but repositories that include decades of code history messages, like Windows. ' </p>

<p>Guilty SPARC: Oracle euthanizes Solaris 12, expunging it from roadmap | Ars Technica </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'The good news, based on a recently released Oracle roadmap for the SPARC platform, is that both Solaris and SPARC appear to have a future. ' </p>
<p>'An Oracle spokesperson promised to Ars that he would provide a statement on the roadmap and the future of Solaris this afternoon. ', &quot;Rumors have been circulating since late last year that Oracle was planning to kill development of the Solaris operating system, with major layoffs coming to the operating system's development team.&quot; </p>
<p>'Oracle later announced a new roadmap for Java EE that recalibrated expectations, focusing on cloud services features for the next version of the software platform. ' </p>
<p>'The bad news is that the next major version of Solaris—Solaris 12— has apparently been canceled, as it has disappeared from the roadmap. ' </p>

<p>The Rise of NetBeans — Why The Increasingly Popular IDE Has Streamlined Java Application Development for a Network of 1.5M+ Active Users - HostingAdvice.com </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'NetBeans IDE is more well known as the popular web development tool that streamlines the building and deployment of applications. ' </p>
<p>'According to the development team, it was the first Java IDE written in Java. ' </p>
<p>'NetBeans has always moved forward with the mission to keep up with the Java platform, and that’s why all major releases of the IDE have coincided with releases of the Java Development Kit (JDK). ' </p>
<p>'The NetBeans IDE is a development tool, but it is also a desktop windowing platform that allows complex applications to be built and deployed in Java and other languages. ' </p>
<p>'The rise in academic usage of NetBeans is attributable to a program Sun Microsystems started before the Oracle acquisition, Bill told us. ' </p>

<p>LaunchDarkly gets $8.7M to get access to the right features in front of right users  |  TechCrunch </p>
</blockquote>
<p>'We know the big companies can build this in-house but we can’t. ' </p>
<p>'And some of these features are already trickling out to some extent, but LaunchDarkly offers a more comprehensive look at how to roll these new features out, Harbaugh said. ' </p>
<p>'Facebook open sourced the basic functionality of service features to different pieces, but they didn’t open source who has access to what, which layers. ' </p>
<p>'It’s not too far off the original vision for LaunchDarkly, but it does indeed expand the market opportunity for the company. ' </p>
<p>'We want to be able to have all our code live and ready and when a big launch hits, and turn on that feature and not be stressed. ' </p>
