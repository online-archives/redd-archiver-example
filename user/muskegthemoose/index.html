They /u/-Ph03niX- has probably not even thought about the vast majority of them since they were made. There are legitimate issues with /u/-Ph03niX- to be sure, he's a very busy revolutionary, but complaining that he(?) "mods too many subreddits" just makes the person complaining look like they don't know how reddit works. It's not worth it to the admins/management to limit the number of subs a user can mod because they can just make more user accounts.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The owners of reddit want to make money. As much money as possible as efficiently as possible. They see pandering the left as a more lucrative market to exploit than giving an equally open platform to all views on the political spectrum. They overwhelmingly support leftist politicians [(link)](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000041920&amp;cycle=2014) despite having a tradition of avoiding taxes with the best of 'em [(link)](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/business/newhouse-s-private-empire.html) which is distinctly un-leftist behaviour. As the magazine business dies [(link)](https://www.foliomag.com/conde-nast-paradise-publishing-lost/) they are trying to figure out how to get more money out of reddit, because it's clear that online is the future and very soon print will be dead. Therefore principles (Freedom of Expression) go out the window in favor of expediency (Get the money!) because all business only cares about short term profits now. In the case of reddit, Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc, they are all existing on borrowed time, as the narrative about "influence" makes it more and more likely that Section 230 will be removed from law because politicians want to control the flow of information. [(link)](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/social-media-platforms-or-publishers-rethinking-section-230/)

As has always been the case since the days of Lenin, the Left is its own worst enemy. Sadly, their learning experiences make life harder for everyone.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Reddit is specifically designed for circle-jerks. The founders looked at all the circle-jerking going on and said "There must be a way to monetize this!" and came up with Reddit. They could change it easily (end upvotes and downvotes, rate by views only, limit posts and comments per day from an ip address, actually pay real mods to delete spam, make accounts require a credit card, etc.) but they are happy with what's going on now. They still think that if they tweak enough, they will find a way to make a healthy profit. What is actually more likely to happen is it will gradually fade away as it overrun with radicals and people like you lose interest. </div>
