Specifically about them changing their questions: "Giles and O'Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited their statements from the released videos."  This came from the CA investigation where they exchanged immunity for the unedited CA tapes. (only instance where we have the full unedited video/audio)  
 
The wikipedia entry has 138 sources linked in it. 
  
They lied about wearing pimp costumes, they lied about whether ACORN employees actually helped them (in Philadelphia), some of the ACORN employees played along (like in CA and Philadelphia) in order to get as much information as possible and then immediately reported it to the police. 
 
In Philly O'Keefe claimed the employees were helping them. He released audio of him asking questions and made it seem like they were aiding and abetting his criminal prostitution ring. Keefe claimed they were 100% onboard with helping them. But the police report, the fact they called the police on him while he was there and Keefe's unwillingness to release the unedited versions kind of makes him a fucking liar. 
  
In reality the ACORN employees in Philly called the police, made a police report and had the police escort them out of the building. 
 
Don't get me wrong, some of the ACORN employees did say things that were inappropriate. Some of them were specifically in order to get more information and then later they reported it all to the police, but I don't know if all of them were. 
 
But literally every investigation cleared the ACORN employees of anything criminal. The worst ACORN "offenders" literally reported everything to the police immediately after - and their police reports stated that they played along for more information - all well before the videos came out. </div>

I'm honestly not sure what "gotcha" moment you think you're having here. 
 
I called you a liar because you said the unedited video and audio was available to watch. 
 
It's not.  
 
You lied.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No ... ACORN was exonerated by multiple investigations, including Republican investigations in Republican controlled states.  
  
James O'Keefe was full of shit. 
  
You know in AMA's sometimes when someone asks an actress a question like "Would you consider doing a sequel?" 
  
And the actress responds with "Yes" 
 
And then the original person edits their post to say "Would you consider doing ANAL in a porn video?" 
 
That's basically what O'Keefe did. He took ACORN employees answers and spliced different questions before them. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That was the stick that they went after him with, yes. 
 
Apparently it was literally the only thing that they could get him on (a private civil charge) because the CA DA made the mistake of giving him immunity from state prosecution in exchange for the unedited video and audio. 
 
He settled with the CA Acorn employee $100,000 and issued him an apology as part of the settlement because he used editing to make it seem like he was a willing participant in trafficking underage girls which got him fired and smeared in the media, despite the fact the person was innocent and also immediately contacted the police to report O'Keefe. </div>

See the ACORN video where it turned out it was almost 100% fabricated and resulted in all charges dropped against ACORN and James O'Keefe actually paying $100,000 and issuing an apology to the worker he completely misrepresented and slandered. 
 
He literally edited in different questions to make it look like the ACORN employee was willingly engaging in crimes.  
 
But they only found all that out after it was subpoena'd. </div>
