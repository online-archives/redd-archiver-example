At that point I was still a bit confused about "banning" vs "shadowbanning", but it doesn't impact on the case.

Banned, nobody will tell me why, no warnings.

Unfortunately, when evil, shitty people are those who take the lead and organize in "feminist" and "women's" groups, then that will inevitably have an impact on the perception of "women's movements", justifiably so (the participants there could revolt, reject the moderators and/or find another subreddit - they don't).</div>

That's wrong. You only get a message when you are banned, not at any point later.

They are going to justify mass banning by making vague references to people having done something in the past to get on some ban list, and just now they suddenly ban everyone. They will refuse to tell you why. This is just the act of sociopaths to manipulate and obfuscate what they do, pretending they are following the rules, whilst denying you the information to verify that.</div>

So you just asserted that the rules apply to them - but oh wait! they just happen to not follow the rules. It's something they could set up a bot to do very easily, but haven't.

But the rule totally applies to them JUST LIKE it applies to The_Donald! They just don't follow it - but I swear the admins are evenhanded because it applies to them! The rules apply the same to everyone equally, even if not everyone follow them equally and some can do that and others can't.

&gt;&gt;"Threats" are against sitewide rules and apply to all users - it doesn't require any special rule.

&gt;**So you agree that TD calling for spez to go into the gas chamber is a fair reason for punishing the sub? Especially because TD has been doxxing, harassing, and attacking the admins for months now?**

No, that's more obfuscation.

Firstly: As I pointed out: "Threats" are against sitewide rules and apply to all users - it doesn't require any special rule.

The rule against threats apply to all users. That is, all users individually. It applies all across the entire site. Any person posting a threat is liable for action under sitewide rules. Any person posting private information is liable for action under sitewide rules. 

Subreddits don't post. Users on subreddits post. There is no need for any "special rules", because the existing rule would mean that anyone breaking the sitewide rules can be banned, and those not doing it won't be banned. 

Secondly: Saying a public person should kill themself is on the border of "threat". If that's bannable as a "threat", then innumerable people posting that Trump should kill himself should be banned for making threats, and probably investigated for threatening a sitting President. There's this image where Trump shoots himself through the head - admins can just search for that and mass ban everyone who ever posted it. Will they do that? No, they won't.

Thirdly: You claimed that was the purpose for the special rules. It isn't, because banning them from linking to other subreddits is completely unrelated to what they say about spez. 

You're posting in bad faith here - you have continually obfuscated throughout. It wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if I see people killing each other in the street - society is pregnant with extremism, and you are one.</div>

"Threats" are against sitewide rules and apply to all users - it doesn't require any special rule. And why would this justify a ban on linking to other subreddits, which doesn't apply to other subreddits?

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;**you're right that there are other subs that do shit they shouldn't be allowed to. But that doesn't excuse your own shitty behavior.**

Actually, it very much does. On an even playing field, everyone should have the same tools and methods available to them. Particular restrictions on some people isn't an even playing field.

Moreover, this unevenness is deliberate - a single admin could in 10 minutes apply all the same rules to all the other subreddits, or some other subreddits.

The notion that, hey, you must accept these special rules, and just keep appeal to the rulemaker to apply the same evenhandedly, is just a shitty demobilization tactic, when the rulemaker deliberately chose not to do so. In fact, that appeal has been made a great number of times - and ignored. 

From now on, any post you make must have appropriate punctuation and capitalization, or it gets removed. It's part of an effort for better quality posts. Should this apply to everyone? Well, yeah, you can spend a few months or years or whatever appealing to me to apply it to everyone. Just make sure you follow the rule in the meantime. (that was obviously a parody of the sociopathic individuals on the admin team).</div>

What? That's complete bullshit.

Firstly, "Dont brigade, harass or doxx people" are sitewide rules. It makes no sense whatsoever to say that they are _special rules_ applied on subreddits _targeted by the admins_. Again: they are not special rules, and they are not applied only to certain subreddits.

The rules applied to posters on The_Donald were different from these - amongst other things, they could not link to other subreddits for any reason whatsoever.

Linking to other subreddits is not the same as brigading. Brigading is something an individual can do, if you follow a link and vote or comment, or something moderators can do (indirectly) by both linking and telling people to follow the link and vote or comment. 

Any subreddit can link to other subreddits. On any subreddit, if an individual should brigade, the individual may be penalized for that.

That is, any subreddit can link to other subreddits, other than The_Donald.

This restriction isn't mutual - other subreddits can link to The_Donald.

Your post gets all of the above completely wrong. It's basic stuff. Your post is still heavily upvoted. That's really, really bad, and points to some problems with Reddit users.</div>
