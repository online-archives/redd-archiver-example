I’m saying he’s guilty because there’s video evidence that for over 8 minutes officers used a banned restraint technique (known to cause positional asphyxia)  on a man who was obviously no longer a threat to them while being made aware by bystanders and the victim that there appeared to be significant risk of death or serious harm to George Floyd. They can not claim that they were unaware that what they were doing could result in death. Murder 1? Fuck no, unless the claims of interactions between chauvin and Floyd at a previous workplace could be better substantiated. But absolutely this is a homicide in both the medical sense and the legal sense.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So....why does he need to write the report twice then? So you get a source that elaborates on how you’re too dumb to understand an autopsy report and breaks down both documents and you act like you’re smart? You’re fuckin hilarious thanks for making for some great screen caps. He wrote the report, you’re too dumb to understand how it confirms Floyd died of homicide (literally translated says his heart stopped due to the hold), you get clearly presented info that you’re wrong, now you’re gonna go jack off to your wife’s onlyfans.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You’re such a dumbshit that’s the media contact for the press release you could find that out in two seconds. Homicide means the death was directly caused by another human being, he would still be alive if not for chauvins actions. They make press releases because people like you don’t know what big words mean, and see mention of say, heart disease (wildly common in American men) and instantly think that makes your case. The amounts of drug metabolites (what they use to determine intoxication and amounts/use patterns) do not represent someone “Loaded”.  See normally it’s okay not to know these things if you aren’t a medical professional of some kind, so the county coroners office prepare a statement with a publicist to condense the information. Pretty common practice. And for your information I wear Timberlands, they’re great for kicking in the doors of reactionaries. So if Someone choked out your grandmother, it wouldn’t be murder because she died of other conditions, right? And literally off the top of my head I’ve linked to it independently from a local news site and npr, and I’m sure if you actually tried or followed your news somewhere other than Brietbart or TruePatriotNewsFacts.geocities.net you’d have seen it by now.</div>

I present to you the normal report every autopsy doc in the us makes when a press inquiry is made and you call it some fake shit. You’re obviously delusional and it’s kind of hilarious. You can contact the office to verify the document. Everything you’re claiming about how he died is verifiably WRONG with the numbers shown in the autopsy report that you posted. I think the fact you people go through this much effort do be verifiably wrong and then claim you’re being conspired against is fucking hilarious. Like no dude, people just don’t like you!</div>

People care that a group of society’s waste is using hate group related terminology (while using a facade of sincerity to claim it’s a coincidence) to troll people who already deal with harassment on a daily basis. You know why you don’t talk this shit in real life, right? Because you know you’d be ostracized, not censored. Because the people around you would see what a toxic little shit you are, to invest this much time harassing people over what they do with their bodies. Honestly I think you all get off on it.
