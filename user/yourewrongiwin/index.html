  It crazy you make this claim about Christianity and other religions not being violent: 
" Book of 1 Samuel, when God instructs King Saul to attack the Amalekites: "And utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them," God says through the prophet Samuel. "But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey."

I am not saying Islam is perfect and all must bow down, however you are definitely spreading misinformation. Hadiths are absolutely disputed and discussed, I am speaking from experience. If you don't believe that Hadiths are argued for and against and are 100% rule and law, please post some sources. </div>

  I find it interesting that I now have seen over 10 posts about negativity and violence, and these two verses are the only ones quotes over and over again. So even if those 2 are as negative as they seem, but the other 99.9% is not violent, then what? </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well lets be clear the Hadith in question does not call for the KILLING or DEATH of anyone. It says the word fighting, which is very very different. Also the Hadith is not calling out for the blind killing of people, but claiming that there will be war. Are you saying that there is no legitimate reason in the world ever to go to war? The US and all of history for that matter might disagree...  
  
  The reality is, old religious doctrines of all religions need to put in context, and people interpret them differently. Again, it is very important to read the whole story, not just one sentence. 
  1) Verse 2:191 you posted has many many sites explaining the context of the situation. Even with the context it is not all rosy, but are you really expecting a whole religion to be as peaceful as a complete pacifist? Couldn't this verse be taken as a version of the US popular quote "Don't Tread on Me" or "Fire on sight"? And while this verse can be interpreted many ways, this one is pretty straight forward: 5:22 "Whoever kills a soul unless it be for murder or sowing discord in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity" and "whoever saves a person is as though he has saved all of humanity." So killing innocent people is completely out of the question.  
  
2) Here is a verse, that I can agree looks negative to most. And while my interpretation does not justify it, it is important to note that this verse still does not advocate what we know today as Muslim extremism: 1) The reason why this verse is so harsh is because having a "son of god" goes against one of the biggest beliefs of Muslims, that there is only one higher being, and that is God. 2) EVEN THEN this verse does not say "Go out and kill all the Jews and Christians" it says "May God destroy them". Doesn't necessarily justify it, but at the same time, it in no way advocates violence and killings. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't agree with the word "warlord".  
  1) The very first excerpt from the Quran from the link you posted shows that the Quran says fighting is only allowed when you have been wronged, when you are kicked out of your home for saying "I am a Muslim". To me, all that means is God believes in the right to religious freedom, just like our founding fathers.  
  2)Those times were riddled with religious wars. The crusades were a blood bath. I never saw any proof (relative term) that the Prophet went to war just for the sake of it, or that he liked the taste of blood, or any personality trait that would label him as a "war mongerer"  </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, Hadiths are integral to Islam, but it is important to note:  
 1) Hadiths are absolutely not taken as law or the rule of the land. They are known as suggestions as this is how the Prophet lived his life.  
  2) Again, the context was "Don't say a greeting first because we are going to argue about breaking a peace treaty", in that context the quote, IMO, is warranted.    
  3) Hadiths, the Quran, and any religious doctrine for that matter is up for interpretation, in fact some Imams in Islam encourage to challenge and discuss different interpretations. People understand the words differently. That's how you get extremists (ISIS, cults, etc), middle, and lax people in ALL religion.  
  
Here is the other thing, I am sure there is a bunch of stuff in the Quran that you would see as negative, even I find some sayings I do not agree with completely. Does a couple verses in the Quran about war and the supposed future mean that all Muslim are angry extreme killers? Come on. The positive of the Quran far outweighs the negative, and that I will vehemently stand by.  
  
Thanks for the respectful response. I can't really discuss anything with people that tell me to get off my camel and go home (even though I was born here). </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I try not to comment on Reddit but came across this sub via Trump news. I gotta say, I agree that the censorship is out of control, but all of you should know to do your own research.  

I am a not so great Muslim who questions everything all the time. Which lead me to question everything in the above post. I believe the comment should not have been deleted, but none the less, the negative response is misleading and completely out of context.   
  
  1) Positive response quotes from the Quran, what Muslims believe to be the word of God and where the rules of Islam truly lie  
  
  2) Negative response quotes from Hadiths, which are teachings and words of the Prophet, but are not taken as rules for Islam, are debated on a regular basis, and should be put into context of the time period. OP even admitted it was a Hadith (although mistakenly says its the highest authority when the Quran is), but the regular joe would not know the significance of that.   
  
  2a) When googling the first negative statement, I came across a website that puts that comment into context. The website says the Prophet said this in regards to traveling to confront a Jewish tribe about violating a peace treaty. Is this website correct? Not necessarily, but that gives a pretty good reason IMO, especially since as explained above the Quran trumps Hadith 100% and the Quran says: 'When you are greeted with a greeting, greet with one better than it or return it.' (4:86)

3) He claims he can pull negative statements from the Quran, but does not offer any. If it was so easy, why would he not have taken the short amount of time to do it?   
  
4) The second negative statement I do not classify as negative, but just a religious doctrine being kinda...out there. The statement is not saying anything negative about Jews, just that there will be war, and apparently trees and rocks will choose sides...   
  
  
Now the comment should NOT have been deleted to allow for this discussion, but the comments in here are pretty mob mentality (at least the negative ones I saw). Always two sides to a coin.
