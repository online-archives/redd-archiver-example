We can all see the article is genuine and it is indeed organic content. Just because he wrote it on his blog and posted a link, rather than writing all the text in a reddit post, doesn't mean he's "spamming." 

But that's my opinion. We're in this subreddit to post where we feel censorship is occurring and discuss/debate it </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They mocked us?! I won't stand for this! I'm gonna message them and have a stern talk, mod to mod. 

But no seriously I don't think pulling this subreddit as a threat is a good plan. The mods will do as they like. If you feel their reason for banning you was not covered under their rules, especially if you feel it was done to silence your opinion as it went against theirs, then please post it here so it can be recorded, discussed, and archived for everyone to see. If we didn't post the censoring here, the mods would be allowed to simply masquerade as fair when in reality many of them are the complete opposite. (/r/WorldNews, for example)

To me, it's a bit cringey to invoke this sub as a means to get unbanned from a porn sub. I can almost guarantee their reasoning for banning you wasn't political. They just want their commenters to type their polite replies (with one hand) and move on. I'm not saying you shouldn't post this here like you did, but please don't act surprised that they didn't unban you and ask forgiveness when you mentioned us.

We're not a personal army. We're here to keep 'em honest so they can never say they're something that they're not. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;I don’t get why the people complaining in this thread don’t make their own world news sub with less censorship?

Like a sub for news, but without the censorship. Uncensored news? I kind of like it. Yeah. I think I'll call it /r/UncensoredNews

That's why. A subreddit devoted simply to the idea that the news should be without censorship has been outlawed on this website. You can't just allow people to think a certain way. You must eliminate the wrongthink or the admins will do it for you. Truly a sad state of affairs. I do respect your suggestion and wish we could do just that. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh. I think you may have the wrong subreddit. This is a subreddit devoted to pointing out all censorship. *All* censorship. From any side.

Also I think you may have a poor understanding of the "nazi agenda." They were all about censorship. That's the polar opposite of this subreddit.

* This subreddit = against censorship
* Nazis = used censorship to further their own agenda

Or maybe it's a poor understanding of our agenda. We just catalog when censorship happens and point out that we feel it's wrong. 

You know, since you brought up Nazis and I'm thinking about it now, I'd say the subreddits we're pointing out on this sub are way more like the Nazis than this sub is. </div>

&gt;Jesus. People bending over backwards to defend ISIS. Zombified.

. 

&gt;Yeah it's important we don't blame this on ISIS, we wouldn't want to tarnish their good name...

. 

&gt;You don't get a "ISIS official membership card" - it is a string of websites held together by - the guy made it clear he is doing this for IS ... but you disagree with him, and with common sense to apologise for his actions? Get out of here you sick apologist

. 

&gt;You're retarded, the boys over at IS ask followers to do shit like this and this guy does, of course it is IS related. It's people like you walking on eggshells not to upset radiacal Islam that adds to this apologetic world.

. 

&gt;Oh like when isis beheaded a priest in church or drove a truck over children? Truly the religion of peace

. 

&gt;How many innocents are gonna have to die and suffer before we value our own citizens over these "refugees"

. 

&gt;How many more times of this will we need to wake up and start doing something more serious about these extremists. Only a small part of them are peaceful refugees.

. 

&gt;Well I know this is a lie. Reddit told me the gun laws would make this impossible

. 

This is just part and parcel of living in a big European city. And can someone remind this guy that guns are illegal in France! and so is shooting people!

&gt;If only the french were more inclusive to Muslim culture! These sort of things would not happen!

.

&gt;Religion of peace strikes again.


I could go on and on... </div>

That's why I mentioned in my post that it was amazing they didn't delete the thread. It's not science. But it makes Trump look bad so they not only let it stay, but they removed any comments pointing out the utter hypocrisy of the whole thing.

They're not, they're just expected to not only get the ones that are Conservative views.

Because they're only removing Conservative comments. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The evidence of censorship lies not only in what was removed, but what was allowed to stay. Removing something because it is in violation of subreddit rules is simply rules enforcement. Take, for example, /r/The_Donald removing many anti Trump posts. They literally have a rule that clearly states that any talk of Trump in a negative light is not allowed. Hence how what they're doing isn't censorship. 

So if, as another example, /r/news or /r/worldnews made a rule that stated that any post that didn't follow the Liberal agenda was not allowed then the censorship on those subreddit would not be censorship, it'd simply be rules enforcement.

The issue here with /r/NoStupidQuestions is that they can't claim any of this was simply rules enforcement since they only removed posts that echoed Conservative sentiments and readily allowed super biased, super Liberal, super opinionated, fact-lacking posts. That's not rules enforcement. It's selective removal to forward an agenda behind the mask of fairness. That's censorship. </div>

If they can't, that censorship. Message the mods and ask why you were banned.

Also, yeah, that sub is garbage. I unsubbed a few months back. It's like r-pics now where "Le Drumpf" is apparently a genuinely great picture and is by no means only being allowed up because of the mods' agenda. </div>

Locking the thread comment: Locked, as apparently civil conversation about books is impossible. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday.

One of the censored comments: I cannot downvote this enough. Do we really want to take this sub down that rabbit hole?

So the mods censor a comment about how the post has nothing to do with books, then the mods post wondering why no one is talking about books. That's some shithole mods. </div>

The current top post on /r/news is about the ambassador to the Netherlands. But it pushes their narrative so I guess that isn't too political. Seems like their sidebar could use a little more honesty. Maybe something like:

Posts that are primarily political will be removed, unless they push the mods' narrative in which case that's totally allowed. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I used to think /r/The_Donald also was big on censorship. But then I looked in to their rules and realized they aren't censoring. They're enforcing their publicly available rules. Right in the sidebar it clearly states that /r/The_Donald is for Trump fans, and if you aren't a fan of Trump, don't post there.

If /r/WorldNews, /r/news, and /r/politics got honest one day and added a rule in their sidebar that said "Anything you post here that doesn't align with our political agenda will be removed." then it would no longer be censorship. It'd just be rules enforcement.

It's not important what the sources are or which sub they're being posted to. If it isn't against the rules and they're just being removed that's censorship, and that's what I'm against. Not because I like Hilary or I think the Mueller investigation is shit or for any reason that ties me to a particular political side. It's not that at all. It's because I think people should decide for themselves what they think is right or wrong, when they're on a sub that doesn't bill itself as being completely one-sided. </div>

Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or "inconvenient" as determined by government authorities or by community consensus.

Sounds like the community in question is the /r/news mods, and they have a consensus that a secret list of domains is not allowed. The fact that they won't even share it makes it even worse, hence my use of "of the highest order."</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That kind of sounds like a threat to dox. This is some incredibly rampant censorship that Reddit is allowing on one of the largest subs out there, and I disagree with it 100%, but doxing, or advocating for it, is just as wrong in my book and is against site wide rules. We're here to point out censorship and how wrong it is, but we don't get a pass to do wrong things ourselves. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;it's a story about an event that has no bearing on world politics or events.

This is a *major* story in the ongoing changes around the world in attitudes towards people who believe they're anther gender. 

Here's a post about Pakistan criminalizing discrimination against Trans people.  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6t9kfp/pakistan_set_to_criminalize_discrimination/

Here's one about sex workers, immigrants and trans gender people being rounded up in Greece.
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hhrbh/sex_workers_immigrants_and_transgender_being/

Each piece of news there shows that /r/WorldNews certainly believes that trans issues are important. Pakistan is making it illegal to discriminate against them, and Greece is rounding them up. There are many different events going on with this issue.

It is not some insignificant thing that a woman who feels uncomfortable having a man do a procedure that many women would only want a man to do is made to feel like a bigot because of a feeling she and many other women share. We've started moving in to a world where you can't be allowed to feel safe unless the PC police say you're eligible. </div>

But if the cream were thicker, now the knife can move through it and split it in to two distinct pieces. Now it's so thick you can actually cut it, whereas before it was not thick at all and the knife simply passed through it and did not cut it at all.

Censoring this post is the thickest of cream. </div>

They want it to stop and they think it won't until we stop ignoring that it's Muslim extremists and that religion just can't mesh with Western society. Why won't the mods let that be heard? What's the harm in allowing the discussion? Aren't you just supposed to be the news? Why do you allow such blatant talk of how white a guy in a van is, but not a peep of EVERY MUSLIM ATTACKER? 

I don't get it. What happened? Aren't we all as humans interested in survival? </div>

Also I'd encourage anyone reading this to unsub from /r/news. The best way to show Reddit that it shouldn't be a default sub is to keep its subscriber count lowering. 

Neither side should be ok with censorship. </div>

PLEASE someone make a new BestOf post with the admission and everything. This is the most obvious BestOf material there is. The internet received justice this day and our site is free-er of bots. We should all want true organic content, no matter who we voted for. </div>
