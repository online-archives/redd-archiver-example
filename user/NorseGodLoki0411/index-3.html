    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This subreddit is against censorship, but we aren't advocates of calls to violence. I'm pointing out this thread to show how actual rules violations are treated on some subreddits. Myself and many is this subreddit have had posts or comments censored, and bans issued, when no rules were violated at all, simply because the butt hurt mod didn't like what was being said. And usually they pretend you broke a rule, but refuse to be clear about any of it because of course you didn't do anything wrong at all.

But here we have an entire thread of rule breaking, yet no comments are removed. The post isn't removed. The users aren't banned. It's advocating violence, and the mods, despite their hollow sticky at the top and super delayed lock, are complicit.

Break the rules but say something the mods like? Your post gets to stay up and unlocked for a bit. Don't break the rules but say something the mods don't like? Ban, censored. Fuck these mods.</div>

Answer: Joe invites all kinds of guests to his podcast to talk to them. Not to intimidate them but to have a conversation with them. A lot of people don't like the idea of right wingers being able to talk.
A lot of people also have a problem with liberals being able to talk. He didn't give Alex Jones much pushback, but he did the same with Jack Dorsey (Twitter CEO). People forget he's mostly just there to have a conversation and that this isn't some Fox News/ CNN segment.
So a lot of people choose to ignore everything else and just notice the fact that he's "giving right wingers a platform" when in reality he gives everyone a platform.</div>

The Reddit admins are cucks. Must be fun raising your wife's boyfriend's children.

Edit: Hahhaa yep, it's the URL. The big league politics video of South African party leaders openly calling for the murder of white people. Incredible.

Here's the archived URL so you can visit the link yourself even though the Reddit admins are trying to control what you see for their own political gain and due to their own personal feelings, rather than the actual good of the web site.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're on a sub that is made entirely to fight censorship. As a moderator I am constantly trying to ensure I do as little removing of comments as possible. Imagine the irony if we just removed everything. Look at my post history. I'm the whitest guy you'll meet.

I'm sorry you feel that I was being biased. I really wasn't. I'm just trying to be as lenient as possible when it comes to comment removal. That's all it is. I genuinely feel like you're mistaking me for one of the shitty mods we post in this sub about all the time. I assure you I'm not.

If I were, would I show this kind of concern about your feelings? No, I'd tell you to fuck off, remove your comment, and ban your ass. I'm not that kind of mod. This isn't that kind of sub. Sorry you feel the way you do though. I do hope I can change your mind.</div>

&gt;So no discussion to be had about the extremism that may or may not be brought by these people? That's insane. It's downright dangerous to disregard any argument against a set of values and ideas as "racist" and just ban/remove said arguments. It's exactly the type of intolerance and discrimination you claim to be against. It's an insult to freedom of speech and to the very goal of this website and the internet.

Also, what is this to do with politics? Wanting reddit moderators to stop censoring the truth in favor of their own feelings isn't a political statement. Since when did it become "right wing" to want the truth?</div>

It doesn't **primarily** concern politics. It **primarily** concerns a known criminal getting away with those crimes. The fact that the people who got him out of it were once politicians doesn't make this **primarily** political. The point isn't that they were politicians, it's that they had a lot of pull. It's not important how they had so much pull, just that they did indeed have it.

The mods removed my post because it didn't fit their narrative. They want this criminal to be let off the hook and they don't want anyone pointing out the absolute corruption of his getting away with these heinous crimes. Their narrative is why my post was removed. </div>

Here are some comments that the mods of /r/news wanted to ensure people didn't see lest they possibly have a thought of their own:

&gt;He's a Democrat connected to Kamala Harris and Obama, and the prosecutor is best buddies with both of those people.

&gt;As usual, the left is above the law and can commit crimes with impunity.

_

&gt;The judge (that previously recused herself) is good friends with Smallet, Booker, and Kamala harris.

_

&gt;basically if the president can get away with it, why cant the rest of them

_

&gt;Prosecutor equated the result of prosecuting would likely result in community service and since he has done community service in his past he is off the legal hook. 16 federal indictments = likely community service...

_

&gt;My bet is that he was coordinating with Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and that this whole charade was to give their anti-lynching bill some momentum.

_

&gt;At least his name is mud and he destroyed his career.

_

&gt;I am simply amazed. Then again, I am not. The legal system for conservatives vs. liberals is like night and day. This should cause outrage. The same outrage that Jussie was trying to falsely gin up.

_

&gt;#boycottempire

_

&gt;Because he is famous black gay actor. If it was you or me, then our asses would've been in jail so fast, our anus would become a tear in time-space continuum.

https://snew.notabug.io/r/worldnews/comments/b2vi76/telstra_blocks_access_to_4chan_8chan_liveleak_in/

With over 11,000 comments, ceddit took almost ten minutes to load the page. Here's the removeddit if that's helpful:

https://www.removeddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/b2vi76/telstra_blocks_access_to_4chan_8chan_liveleak_in/

Here's some comments the mods at /r/WorldNews didn't want you to see:


&gt;It's gonna take the establishment a few shootings by death-penalty-for-apostacy-phobic whites (Islamist terrorism is just "part and parcel of living in a big city" so no big censorship push needed afterwards) to get to banning encryption it seems. I'm sure Anons are already migrating to tech like IPFS to prep for something stronger than a DNS block given how censorship happy the West now is.

_

&gt;I am for Facebook being censored, Censored out of existence, the China way.  

Guess we're not allowed to talk bad about China now. Wonder if that order came down from the shit for brains admins right in to the waiting mouths of the /r/WorldNews power mods. 

&gt;fuck anyone who censors anything. This is a bigger terrorist attack than the actual shooting  

The fact that the above comment was censored is some of the most palpable irony I've found in a while. 

&gt;I’m on Optus, can still access /b. Phew

How does the above comment break any rules?

&gt;This post will be removed soon

_

&gt;Disgusting fascist censorship.

_

&gt;4chan had nothing to do with it. Why was it censored?

_

&gt;In other news, censorship, censorship, and MORE censorship!

_

&gt;NZ are doing exactly what the shooter predicted they would over extend and over react. This is just going to redpill more normies on what happens when you love in a socialist country. Gg liberals, youre your own worst enemy.

Sorry for anything poorly formatted. I do all of my Reddit through mobile so this is all done on my phone swapping between tabs. </div>

&gt;Fuck the right wing and all those who enable them. This is a direct result of the normalisation of White Supremacy and White Nationalism. Thoughts are with the victims.

That's from the thread on the New Zealand terrorist attack. 

Why is this comment not allowed though?

&gt;It just begun, the holy war against the worlds true enemy - Islam

That's from the thread on the Utrecht terrorist attack. So it's ok to blame all white people for something, which is super racist, but it definitely isn't okay to blame all Muslims? </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Just looked at some of the removed comments, especially all the ones at the very bottom of the page. These mods are disgusting. It's very possible he was the victim here, yet they want to bury it. But everyone was all for pushing this to the top when they thought she was the victim. Disgusting. It shouldn't matter whether it was a guy or a girl. Anyone who is a victim of domestic abuse should not see their story covered up.

Here's some comments that the /r/OutOfTheLoop mods wanted to keep you from seeing:

&gt;This is why I hate contemporary social media mob justice. It seems like people feel a need to take a strong stance on every little thing just so they can feel like they're on the "right side of history".
&gt;'Believe victims' was well-intentioned (getting people to not automatically dismiss allegations and accusing alleged victims of trying to stir up drama) but people have taken it as a license to mass-harass and ostracize the alleged perpetrator based on hearsay alone. That isn't social justice, that is the same kind of zealotry that we find in the Spanish Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, and the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic of the 80s and 90s.
The slogan should be taken as "Take allegations seriously and suspend judgment"  
  
_

&gt;If that is true, it is fucked up. It's disgusting when people fabricate stories of abuse. It hurts innocent people and helps undermine legitimate cases of abuse.

_

&gt;It's these kinds of cases that do the most harm to causes. It gives ammunition to the hateful and ignorant and it gives pause to those who would support the ones that need it.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I really enjoy the mods comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/avru0y/dude_has_taste_slapped_out_of_his_mouth_for/ehhy2uo):

&gt;It's not that hard to understand guys. Don't say words that you have no right to say and hurt and demean a whole population of people. This subreddit is a cesspool sometimes and it's so sad.

Yeah guys. You're all so stupid. It's not hard to understand. One day we'll all realize we're just a bunch of idiots and these mods are here to make sure we know how to think. In the meantime, they're going to lock threads and just let us know what we did wrong.

Mods also apparently didn't want you to see this comment:

&gt;What a fucking lunatic. Physically assaulting someone just for saying nlgger, he should feel ashamed.
&gt;Also, fun fact: Reddit shadowremoved my first comment where I didn't censor nlgger.

That's right. Calling someone crazy for physically assaulting someone over a word and saying they should feel ashamed is not something those mods wanted you to see.
