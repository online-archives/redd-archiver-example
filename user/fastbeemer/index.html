Let me see if I've got your side figured out:

"Let's show them they are hateful by being hateful" but doesn't that just mean you're hateful too?

"Let's show them they are racist by hating whitey" but doesn't that just make you a racist, because I don't have anymore control over the color of my skin than a black man does?

"Let's show them they are sexist by hating men" but doesn't that just make you a sexist?

Honestly your side is so hateful, so racist, and so sexist I'd be embarrassed if I were you. Luckily America is seeing through it finally, they see the hate on the left, the hypocrisy on the left, the extremist violence on the left, and sadly nobody has the brains to clean the left up.

Mostly though, I'm glad you guys keep posting dumb shit like this, normies see it for what it is, and they don't like it at all. </div>

Why the fuck would we need the unedited video when the subject has already stipulated that its correct? 

This does not diminish the fact that the video is out there, whether you can locate it is up to how good you are. Finding it evidently won't change anything, as CNN agrees that the video is legitimate. But mouth breathers like you are so gullible it won't matter now will it? The truth is an area you can't operate in. </div>

"CNN says a clandestine video of one of the network's producers criticizing its coverage of President Trump is legitimate, further fraying an already strained relationship between the news network and the White House."

Even CNN admits its true, thinks they can shrug it off. They believe you are sheep and will swallow anything they sell you. </div>

Besides the fact that if you truly cared you'd look up the unedited video, it's out there. I'm sorry but you are too hilarious not to respond to. Let me get this straight, the fact that Comey said that Trump has never been under investigation isn't enough proof to believe a video that says Trump has never been under investigation and they have made it up for ratings? The former FBI directors testimony corroborates the video evidence, and you don't want to believe it? I'm not even entertaining the argument you make because it's irrelevant. 

All known evidence points to the video being accurate! No evidence points to it being inaccurate. Stop lying to yourself man, have some fucking dignity. Stop carrying water for the loser left. </div>

Based on your flawed logic, everything CNN has said or published should be discredited because they had to retract a story. That is how your logic follows, correct? If not, why do you give CNN a pass and not PV? The only explanation is that one says what you want to hear, the other doesn't. Isn't the hallmark of journalism saying things the people don't want to hear? If that is the case, PV is definitely journalism for you. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, and it makes sense as the Harvard study pointed out, FOX is the most fair and balanced, so they'd have more coverage of the Tea Party movement. The Tea Party was not a response to Obama however, they were a response to inept establishment Republicans. They did most of their work in primary elections. You could say they were against the Obama agenda, but so were the Republicans, they formed because establishment candidates were not doing anything to stop it. The Tea Party and Trump supporters have both formed as a response to Republicans, not Democrats. You will see them again in 2018, because the Republicans control everything and are getting nothing legislatively accomplished. A full repeal of O-care is the only thing that will stop it. </div>

There is absolutely no symmetry. We did not have "birther" hearings in the senate. The birther thing is more akin to Trump's taxes than it is to Russia, there is symmetry between taxes and the birth certificate. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're kidding right? Do you own stock in CNN? I'm betting it's been a really bad week for you already. You are making yourself look silly, and destroying any personal credibility you might have. 

The facts:

Trump has never been under investigation. 

CNN had to retract a story on Saturday. 

Three employees resigned over it. 

Harvard study shows a 93% negative bias on CNN against Trump. 

Stop letting CNN make you look like a fool, have some self respect. Can you come up with a single plausible scenario in which the producer saying Zucker told them to stop reporting on the Paris Accord and back to Russia could be taken out of context? Given the overwhelming factual evidence, it doesn't matter if it were taken out of context, CNN is worse than PV, and the race isn't even close. 

You are defending people who don't deserve to be defended. They've been conning the public for nearly three decades. They've been named in more lawsuits than PV ever has. They're known to discriminate. They are THE joke. 

PV isn't really breaking any news, we've known this, they are only confirming what the evidence has already demonstrated. They aren't actually bringing anything new to the table. 

I know it must suck being a liberal right now, Trump has never been under investigation, Hillary, Bernie, Lynch, and the Obama DoJ are under investigation. The world's been turned upside down for liberals, but you don't need to be a sheep any longer. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Take all known evidence as a whole, including Comey's testimony, it doesn't really matter if PV is credible. The video provided, combined with the evidence at hand, lends to the credibility of the claim regardless of the source. We know from sworn testimony that the president has never been under investigation, that right there is enough to lend credibility to the idea that CNN is conning millions of people to push their ratings and narrative. 

I'd entertain your opinion more if the PV video were the only evidence of what CNN is doing, but taking everything on the whole, your opinion is most likely flat wrong. </div>
