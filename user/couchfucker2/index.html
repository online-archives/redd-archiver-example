    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I think you’re being subjected to heavy bias from the other commenters but I think you can do a couple things better. First off we can’t see what you were responding to or what your original comments were and we can’t see how many upvotes or downvotes your comment got where you defended yourself, so I can barely see the situation here. And then you’re engaging in name calling too which is usually bannable and it’s not effective at all and you’re not engaging in discourse when you do that. I’d say your probably correct that your being censored out but you can change your tactics and be less likely to be banned. And if you still get banned or deleted then come back and post again.</div>

People are being censored on Reddit for all kinds of reasons and this is the only place I’ve seen discussion about it from time to time. You said you’re just here to witness it but you’re just spreading a mischaracterization of the sub, when you’re going to bother to comment you should just engage and try to make it a better place. Basically, put up or shut up instead of loudly complaining.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It’s very frustrating for sure and happens all over the internet. I’ve found that the most effective form of persuasion is simply exposure and representation more so than arguing or even debate. Simply stating your world view or lifestyle can influence the perimeter of people who can have their minds changed who then work that influence towards the center of their in-group. And if it’s any small consolation, even your downvoted comments are likely still getting views so you still have somewhat of a platform there even if it just seems like your catching hate or are being mischaracterized. People who agree are much less likely to upvote compared with downvotes.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah I looked at your comment history and I agree you’re being heavily subjected to bias a lot of the time. Sometimes you’re running on that fine line where you might be censored out because of lack of decorum, like when you name call, a mod might ban you because you’re being hostile. Most of the time not though, and they’re jumping to conclusions or censoring you because you like to be contrarian it seems as a hobby. I think you’re not wrong a lot of the time though I don’t personally like your comments and find you’re being a bit toxic and negative as well as well as calling entire groups of people idiots and retards, but I think you should have the right to say what you want to say on a sub, especially larger subs. If the sub is a small community that relies on a friendly decorum, then I think it’s fair to censor you out for lack of decorum.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I’ll give you another example that is technically offline. All through film school my professors had no regard for spoilers and discuss third acts of movies uninhibited. And I also listen to two rewatch and analysis podcasts for shows that are over 10 years old, and the hosts mention the issue of spoilers but decided that they don’t believe in warning about spoilers early in their podcast and then never mentioned it again. So if you were to try and listen to each episode as you go through the show episodes, you’ll have details from later seasons spoiled without warning unless you happened to catch them wrangling with it in an early episode.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I agree with you on the spoilers thing. I’m both interested in films and also terrible at seeing them when they come out, to the point where I missed some good 90s ones, even. I find most people do have a statute of limitations on it, especially if it’s over 10 years. I pretty much have given up the debate and just let people know I don’t wanna be spoiled or scroll away. The bigger point though is you’re discovering how Reddit doesn’t like, and suppresses opinions that aren’t popular on the sub, especially if you’re righteous about it. Even simple stuff. As a result, people who disagree with each other on even small things don’t ever get to share opinions or influence each other, and even further we don’t experience reality through the internet the same way. This sub is a rare exception actually, because Reddit censorship effects people of all kinds for all reasons, including those who are being moderated out of Reddit. As you’ll see you’ve already gotten a response from a red pilled dude who is likely on this sub because red pill content is moderated out of a lot of Reddit. I think it’s a great thing about this sub and posts like this at least we have the right to argue with each other or see content we might not like.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">At the end of the day they aren’t held to any sort of standard because they aren’t paid and it’s a ton of work and they prob have to work a real job. I feel like the unwritten understanding is that in exchange for this, mods get to wield power and shape the subreddit according to their biases and values. Which goes against the claims that they aren’t biased or that they will hear appeals. The system doesn’t support that unless someone pays these people, which won’t happen. All we can do is try not to cross the mods, try to dodge certain mods and their shifts, complain about it, and the biggest thing is be critical and always remember that Reddit is not a free exchange of ideas, and mods (in coordination with those who vote on new posts) are biased and determine the tone and messages that appear on the subs.</div>

Hold up, I said the opposite of supporting the ban. They should’ve just deleted the post and sent a reminder. I don’t think these mods are fair or acting rationally. I’m just telling you likely what’s happening and that they probably have no time to manage exceptions or hear people out. Then when they’re called on it, a standard thing is just to give a runaround or move goal posts. That’s because they really really don’t want people to undermine their authority once they’ve decided on something. It’s not community centric leadership, it’s authoritarian.</div>

They do it too but conservative media is out there trying to make us wage slaves and don’t even care if they kill us and democracy in the process. I mean why even bring up gas anyway? The president doesn’t have any control over that, including when trump was in office. That’s a distraction for the much bigger fire. What do you care about more, the price of gas or possibly losing democracy in the US?</div>

I’m constantly irritated by mods and other progressives who would rather wall off anyone that disagrees with them. Even basic representation of people who are not similar to the majority of the people in a subreddit get their comments removed, like when I post content that goes against male hetero stereotypes. The mods bring to their censorship their biases and do not have an appreciation for a difference of opinion or lifestyle. Reddit execs are in favor of this I’m sure, because advertisers would prefer it that way. Also the other person who responded is simply talking past you and not discussing the ban. Also they’re preemptively rude to you because of your opinion and didn’t even explain what they’re trying to say about the medical risks. Meanwhile you’re the one who is simply stating your opinion in a respect tone. God forbid they try to act friendly and try to understand why you feel the way you do and try to change your opinion.</div>
