Tell your fucking kids to stay off Netflix, Rap Music (Kendrick Lamar believes the same thing I was taught), Wild N Out (Nick Canon believes the same thing I was taught) 

And [this link](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/health/ancient-egypt-mummy-dna-genome-heritage/index.html) gives some credence to what I believed you rude asshole. The findings shocked the anthropologists! We are all human asshole, and some of us are trying to learn! 

*It's really **unexpected** that we see this very late shift," Krause says. He suspects increased trade along the Nile—including the slave trade—or the spread of Islam in the Middle Ages may have intensified contact between Northern and sub-Saharan Africa* 

*”A lot of people has **assumed** foreign invaders ... brought a lot of genetic ancestry into the region," Krause said. "**People expected** that through time, Egypt would become more European, but we see the exact opposite."

Modern Egyptians were found to "inherit 8% more ancestry from African ancestors" than the mummies studied. The paper cites increased mobility along the Nile, increased long-distance commerce and the era of the trans-Saharan slave trade as potential reasons why.”*</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">See I thought that it was the claims that Jews were behind many coverts acts carried out by Freemasons & [this 12 lost tribes of Israel conspiracy](https://x.com/1303quez/status/1588466533097148416?s=46&t=Y7tRZiH7iEsf8z8n7FTzjg). I had no idea that there was so much credible evidence that the Original Hebrews & Jesus weren’t White or Black. 

[Iron Solomon vs JC](https://youtu.be/WCPSdqq8vCY?si=JTVwyktVC4CS3AYL) (2018) Iron Solomon, a proud Jew (based on his public persona at least) even conceded that JC was correct about the original Hebrews being Black. 

I never bought into Judaism overlapping with Satanic connections and freemasonry. But I had always been taught to believe that European Jews were only one sub-ethnic group of Israelites. That they moved to Europe during the Trans-Sahara Slave trade of the Middle Ages, and came to populate the Zionist movement of the 20th Century because they had been cut off from Israel (geographically speaking); while the original Hebrews had also been cut off of the region during the aforementioned slave trade. Nothing I believed in attributed some Jewish conspiracy to rob Blacks of their history. The Jewish Diaspora of the Middle Ages is real, but now it seems that even before that, the region wasn’t Black.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Thank you for that last link. 

1) I’m not dumb and don’t appreciate the comic book, insulting reference. I’m aware that Polynesians, Asians aren’t White or Black, but I incorrectly assumed that in North Africa & the Middle East, prior to the Trans-Sahara Slave Trade of the Middle Ages, made it more cut & dry. I mean that Ethiopians (East Africans) are seen and treated like Blacks during my upbringing. I incorrectly assumed that this is what North Africa looked like prior to the aforementioned Slave Trade. 

2) There was a time 2014-2022 approximately 8 years in which a vast majority of people were incorrectly, inaccurately describing Black History; due to White guilt & over-correction. This is the reason why Netflix is depicting [Cleopatra](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/netflix-cleopatra-black-egypt-controversy-ancient-queen/) and [Hannibal](https://www.google.com/search?q=hannibal+black+netflix&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari) as Black. Bottom line is that I had plenty of guidance and being misinformed and don’t deserve to be insulted and labeled an antisemite (not on this thread, but in the above post). White guilt and over-correction led this mistake on my behalf, just a much as Black Superiority ideology. I **never** would have or believed in denying anyone of their rights, who disagreed with my incorrect beliefs, but I was still very much incorrect.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Don’t antagonize me. Jesus was falsely depicted was (dirty) Blonde Hair and Blue eyes during my childhood. So I genuinely had reason to doubt what I was taught. Believe it or not, a White Teacher corrected me when I assumed Cleopatra was ethically Greek, and thus her relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony weren’t groundbreaking interracial relationships. Again, a White Teacher corrected me in 2012 and 2015. One pointed to the West African features [Bust of the most iconic of the Pyramids of Giza](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=0ecad74c06ff5026&hl=en-us&sxsrf=ACQVn08a-MvP3iQrNTeRzJK9mi9DpJo9Rg:1708307189838&q=pyramids+of+giza+face&uds=AMwkrPt2njJxP_lufgJpc9S0GqmT4yZIb9CuAk9JwmdGNQpNTPTp5iXqMXvxukqMGdts8ooTCAKIgqTJSXY_XwG6fjSP8HyY8ratCE01CuBCvuHw60H_Ftg0FtOMvK76-vJGeLQFX5Uw8Xu59FqP2c0JgPJgeh6mkGtbYFZn5OE31M8BGCUA5tzCxFlKvVqkIKixTE_stial-r6jtcnYZwx2AgJ9Ch_JJ1m_nYXVaFY-3FBMmus9BELIKJPySYa3JowOUc_b1iQaF88Eq4F8nLrLLKv6WOQ5yw&udm=2&prmd=ivsnmbhtz&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYt96ZpLaEAxXG4MkDHTNuA-kQtKgLegQIERAB&biw=375&bih=626&dpr=3). Again, two different White teachers who I now believe had White guilt, taught me to believe Cleopatra (and ancient Egyptians) were Black. 

I made the incorrect assumption that the original Hebrews were Black; because I assumed the Trans-Sahara Slave Trade of the Middle Age had a drastically different impact. 

I also allowed Whitewashing in [Latin America](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/black-in-latin-america/) to convince me that the coins of Hannibal and images of Ptolemy (astronomer) and Eratosthenes (mathematician, geographer) were simply inaccurate.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don’t see why it’s important than John describes his feet, voice, and hair; but not his total bodily description. I’m not trying to patronize, can you list what would make his descriptions of those three features indicative that it wasn’t Jesus’s or normal Hebrew features (of that time)? 

I also don’t see the correlation of John only describing Jesus’s personal attributes (voice, hair, feet) but not in his Gospel or 3 Books (of John I, II, III).</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Great now we are using sources! [Revelations 1:9-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201%3A9-18&version=NIV) I was always raised to believe that these scriptures hint at a Black Man. This was also used in Malcolm X (movie). And many others like myself have been taught this … 

*13 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,[a] dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.*</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes! And I completely understand where Kanye and Kyrie Irving cross the line comparing Judaism to Freemasonry and alleging Satanic references. 

I’m even well read on the original doctrine of the NOI as covered in the autobiography of Malcolm X.

My mind is being blown as to why [Iron Solomon](https://youtu.be/WCPSdqq8vCY?si=bjKJ1yvla2h7dWhL) basically gives into peer pressure and allows JC to rap what I have been misinformed (from my early research into the topic). I am amazed that Netflix is perpetuating that historical Whitewashing is essentially curable by what now appears to be, historical Blackwashing. 

There are many others like myself who truly believed that before the Trans-Sahara Slave Trade of the Middle Ages, that North Africa/Middle East was Black (more or less).</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I got banned because I stuck up for Russell Wilson when they were pointing out that his former teammates were trashing him, after week One: 2022 season. 

By that point Russell had never been in trouble, and had posted his strongest seasons when the Defense was 22nd & 15th (2019 & 2020 seasons, total yards allowed). Russell **had never 💩’d on: 

- Richard Sherman for drunken harassment of his child’s Mother. 

- Marshawn Lynch for being a Buffalo Bills washout before Pete Carroll resurrected his career. Lynch was replaced by Fred Jackson. 

- Earl Thomas was a disaster in Baltimore and refused to learn their Defensive scheme. Earl had some legal troubles leading up to his divorce. 

When I reasonably pointed out that Russell’s treatment for not being “Black enough” was a double standard and petty; the “sheep” presumed that I have issues with Black people, when I am a Black man who believes in meritocracy. I have seen firsthand that the so-called woke often leaves room for those who wish to exploit & seek only self supremacy; while good qualities that transcend race, get overlooked by the so-called “woke”.</div>
