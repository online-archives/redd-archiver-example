You’re talking about being a member of society on the internet when you have no idea in what shape way or form I provide to society in real life. I’ll tell you what though, I guarantee that I provide way more to our society then you. I don’t feel entitled for anything besides respect for a differing opinion on a forum based on free speech. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'll answer both your questions, some dude insulted me after I gave him a full length rebuttal to his statement. Didn't even counter my argument just attacked me with an ad hominen. So I said something along the lines of "God you people truly are NPCs." because it's true they can't give a rebuttal so they just go back to insult mode. For no reason what so ever. Now for your second question, I'm banned from half of Reddit to subreddits I do not go to because I post on "Undesirable subreddits" not because I go to those subreddits and cause drama. Literally all my bans are "You have been banned for posting in problematic communites" I.E /r/The_Donald (Literally commented there once, don't even like that sub at all really.) /r/Conservative /r/Cringeanarachy and the likes. That's why I am banned from those Subs. Now this time on /r/News literally everything that happened is up there. Never be nice to mods. They're faggots.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">When I was trying to get the ban repealed I looked at each one of the mods post history trying to see if there’d be one that wasn’t far left who maybe would be lenient on my one time offense. I literally never insulted someone on that sub before but that one dude called me shit so I responded. Apparently moron is too harsh for the mods. But yea each mod had a huge leftists disposition. This is Reddit for you, the average age is 21-25 at college and not employed. So you get this huge blue tint on everything you see here. It’s great when you subscribe to subreddits that have no bias or bullshit vague rules though.</div>
