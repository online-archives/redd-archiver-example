    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You realize you're effectively talking to a bot, right?  Look at what they wrote and ask yourself if it was generic enough that it could be reused multiple times with minimal effort.  If it looks like it is generic enough to be reusable you're probably wasting your time talking to a NPC.

They don't care about nuance.  Look at the response you got.  They immediately dismissed your argued distinctions and bulled ahead talking about something else.  Or rather, continuing the propaganda effort they began in the previous post.

When someone talks past you it's time to ask who is it they are actually speaking to.  If it's to anyone other than you then you're probably wasting your time trying to engage with them.  They're just using you as a springing board to launch whatever points they wanted to talk about any how.</div>

So the riots have been planned at least as long ago as November, 2019. Good catch...</div>

&gt; I understand frustration, but the idea of "they censor us so let's shoot them" is not what this subreddit is about. 


That's not what I said and I'll thank you not to put words in my mouth.

I repeat my earlier JFK quote:

"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."

How do you expect this to end but in tears?  If you silence someone, beat them up when they march in protest of their rights being violated, sooner or later words stop being a sufficient response.

&gt;This comment and the original comment are blatant calls for violence in the form of taking up arms in order to make your beliefs and agenda known.

It is not a call to violence to recognize that violence is imminent any more than seeing thunderclouds overhead and lightning flashing makes you responsible for the flood of rain and possible lightning strikes if you declare a bad weather warning. 

You mistake the recognition that we are approaching a bad period of time with an eagerness for that time to approach.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  I seriously hope what I expect to see happen does *not* come to pass.  I hope to be **wrong**.  I do not think I will be though.  Take that as you will.</div>
