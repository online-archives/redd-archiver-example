    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>KDE because they add features for devs and users alike, whilst keeping existing ones. GNOME is just a tablet interface for sausage fingers hellbent on destroying what it used to be in its glory years of the mid 2000's by removing essential interface features. Qt/KDE applications tend to be easier to work with from an interface point of view across multiple platforms, and Qt/KDE tends to have more documentation i have noticed. Also gtk3 is an abomination -- but i do love gtk2, it was fantastic when widely in use.</p></div>

My point is, if someone thinks a certain way, or wants to look a certain way -- why should their biological sex restrain them from being themselves?</p>
<p>People have identified as the opposite of their biological gender for centuries. I don't think the fact that coraline being transgender means anything, assholes will be assholes when they want to power trip. If anything, people like her make others resent transgender communities. </p>
<p>Calling her a man is just cheap shots, and cheap shots is what this egotist and destroyer of open source communities does herself. Maybe she really is just an attention seeking slob, and couldn't get the attention as a male -- which would not surprise me, given how she is trying to destroy open source and implement some fascist ideology onto it.</p></div>

<p>Seriously though, it must be some kind of conspiracy to lower quality and passion within open source development. They just want to watch the world burn. I'm 100% against racism of any kind, including white vs black AND black vs white -- i find it primitive and stupid. But when these feminazi cunts are screaming that only white people can be deemed racists in their &quot;conducts&quot; -- why bother? They are turning libre/free/open source into a totalitarian power trip to massage their egos for attention seeking.</p></div>

<p>Personally, i couldn't care less what something is programmed in. If it runs and does the job it's intended to do... fair game. Alot of experienced programmers can maintain a codebase in a language they've never even learned, all it takes is logic and hacks until you become familiar with it. But hey, that's unprofessional -- can't be unprofessional now can we, better go put on my suit and sit down for a nice plate of node.js.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p><strong>&quot;unprofessional conduct&quot;</strong> (in the screenshot)</p>
<p>What has professionalism go to do with open source / free / libre software. Torvalds is a perfect example of why it isn't needed. Tell it how it is, give the finger to nvidia, and tell people when their code is shit -- they get the point immediately and they learn from it. If it makes you cry, then fix it if you want your code merged.</p>
<p>Otherwise people assume they are doing the right thing, when they are not. Look at a bunch of kids... When little peter can't even scribble a stick figure, and the teacher goes &quot;awww well done, that's brilliant&quot; they keep drawing shitty scribbles. Tell them it's shit, make them cry, and they will learn how to improve things. I'm not saying you should literally swear at your children, but for the sake of telling it how it is -- this is better than professionalism -- it encourages advancement and learning for everyone.</p>
<p>Professionalism is a strange lived-out fantasy (particularly if you wear a suit and sit in an office of clones), i find it bizarre, and tend to associate it with psychopathy. The idea of pretending you are some kind of shrink wrapped plastic figure who conforms to all &quot;norms&quot; defined by an individual is baffling.</p>
<p>Professionalism is not needed in the open source world. The whole point of freedom is just that. To be free from monopolization and corporation. It is essentially the anarchy of computing, it does not require political correctness or Code of Cocksucking agreements and contracts.</p>
<p>Sorry, rant over.</p></div>

Javascript is the most depraving abomination in the history or the web. Not only do i have to download MB's of the same jquery bloat multiple times in a single browsing session, most of the time it isn't even used. OR it's used to draw a drop down box.</p>
<p>I miss the days of optimization. Just over a decade ago, i could load most webpages instantly on a 56k connection (pictures could be slow, depending on format)..... but today i feel it takes longer to load a page even while noscript and rule filters are activated. You can be sat at a desk with an 8 core desktop pc, and you have to impatiently wait while your browser stops responding (on all OS from linux to windows) because the web &quot;designer&quot; decided it was a good idea to reference the same jquery bloat a thousand times in a single header.</p>
<p>Yes i am ranting. JS is the new flash, except flash hasn't even died yet. Kill it with fire. More of these CSS alternatives!</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Personally i prefer Perl. It was my first language learned when coming to linux/bsd and i use it for automating most things still. I find it the easiest to read when it comes to other peoples code. If you know a bit of PHP (or want to), i'd say to go ahead and learn Perl. The syntax is very similar to PHP in common functions and can be useful to learn just for that.  </p></div>
