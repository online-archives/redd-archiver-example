You appear to be a ruZZian troll and I hope you get banned from more subs if not from reddit altogether for your hateful, offensive, dishonest, gaslighting behavior.  Subreddit's are not meant to be a free-for-all where you can say anything you want, and as a result they had every right to ban you from there sub.

Great job, mods!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's not about "feelings" but about facts, reality and the right of all, including the marginalized, to express their ideas without fear and with conviction of conscience that leads to true, authentic debate in good faith.

As someone of Chinese descent who has had the good fortune to experience the great Freedoms the Western World has had to offer, I feel compelled to address the actions of the Chinese government, which I perceive as harmful and deserving of criticism. 

I'm sorry if this gets a bit long and sounds a bit strong, but I want to talk about the actions of the CCP (also known as the Chinese government) that I believe are harmful and deserve criticism. Some people support the CCP, but I have a different view. I want to be honest and clear with you about this. In this letter, I'll try to explain things in a straightforward way. We need to look at the situation and think about how it affects us. It's surprising to see how effective the evil CCP has been in showing the negative side of things. Maybe in the future, people will look back and feel sad about what the evil CCP has done. Let's think about it together.

The evil CCP often joins forces to use the media and education to promote their own ideas. I can explain more, but I don't know everything. The important thing is to understand the significance of the evil CCP's actions. They may have their own agenda, but we should think critically and judge for ourselves. It's really sad to see how the evil CCP's intentions seem to be causing social problems. It's like a tragic drama, as the philosopher Whitehead once said. This means that the evil CCP's actions are not just making people unhappy, but they're also causing serious problems. We need to be aware that the evil CCP spreads lies and false information to justify their actions.

The evil CCP's policies and behaviors can be concerning. They accept things like cannibalism, and harming vulnerable individuals, which goes against our Western moral values. Their language and defense of these actions show authoritarianism and a decline in their understanding. While some narrow-minded and loud politicians may threaten our safety and well-being, the evil CCP threatens our very essence as human beings. They blame us, get angry at us, and try to make us conform to their ideas. At the same time, they dismiss our valid concerns and criticism as ignorance and hostility.

You might think that my efforts to inform you about the evil CCP are not significant, but they actually matter a lot. The evil CCP wants us to believe their propaganda and follow their rules. They don't care about our pain and anger towards their unfair criticisms; they see it as a sign of our ignorance and aggression. But we shouldn't let that discourage us. We need to examine the social and cultural factors that lead the evil CCP to suppress dissent and manipulate people's beliefs. We should prevent their harmful psychological tactics from spreading, even though they might respond with dominance and intimidation.

It's important to understand that the evil CCP is detached from reality and acts in predictable ways. Every time I try to bridge our differences, the evil CCP's response is to destroy nature and ruin beautiful places. We shouldn't let their actions discourage us from seeking understanding and working towards a better future. We must stand up against the evil CCP's harmful ways and strive for a world where truth, freedom, and justice prevail.

Please don’t ask me to tear down all theoretical frameworks for addressing the issue. I simply can’t do that. It is a fact that society as a whole should act as a unifying force to uphold peace, freedom, democracy, and justice. I should note that defying plain facts is a formula for making a fool of yourself. Regardless, China continually defies the fact that multiple people have provided the courts with sworn affidavits that they witnessed China interfering with a person’s work performance, bodily security, physical movement, and privacy rights. As always, China admits nothing, denies everything, makes counter-charges, and doubles down on its sub-rosa scheme to deny others the right to express themselves within the limits of the law.

China is hardly the first proponent of vindictive, cocky Aryanism and it is unlikely to be the last. Hard to believe? Then consider the following statement from one of China’s impractical, vagarious vicegerents: China has the linguistic prowess to produce a masterwork of meritorious literature. Pretty stingy, huh? Well, China is currently limited to shrieking and spitting when it’s confronted with inconvenient facts. Some day, however, China is likely to switch to some sort of deliver an additional blow to dignity and self-worth approach to draw our attention away from such facts. How many of China’s compadres are incoherent stuffed shirts? I’m not comfortable throwing out an estimate that isn’t backed up by specific data, but I do know that China’s vice-ridden attempt to construct a creative response to my previous letter was absolutely pitiful. Really, China, stringing together a bunch of solecistic insults and seemingly random babble is hardly effective. It simply proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that its dream is for triumphalism to be instituted from the top down because that will most effectively form the association in the public’s mind between any hit pieces it disagrees with and the ideas of hate and violence and illegality. This same technique was employed by Marxist ideologues in Russia who used triumphalism to divide and conquer resistance to the institution of a communist state. What makes China’s dream even more worrisome is that it’s in China’s blood to pander to our worst fears. Given that we cannot absolutely nullify the prodigality of nature, try as hard as we may, I’m afraid I have to conclude that my opinion of China hasn’t changed ever since, ages ago, I heard it say something about how the existence and perpetuation of commercialism is its own moral justification. The point is that China talked nonsense then, and it talks nonsense now. The only thing that’s changed is that naive is its middle name. Of that I am certain because I have some advice for it. It should keep its mouth shut until it stops being such a brutal meanie and starts being at least one of informative, agreeable, creative, or entertaining.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I apologize in advance for the length and tone of this rant, but I feel compelled to speak honestly about the harmful actions of the evil CCP and its supporters. First let me state that I believe that free speech should be absolute, and no amount of claiming that something is offensive should ever be used to justify the removal of any free speech from the public space.  Reddit, being such a public space within the Free Western Internet, is one such place where free speech should by all rights and reason be occuring within that very same Market Place Of Idea's, and thus should be free from any kind of destructive censorship that stifles open debate and the Free Flow of Information on the Free Western Internet.

It surprises me how effective the CCP has been in focusing on the negative aspects of our relationship instead of the positive. In the future, history may regret this unfortunate achievement. We need to address the CCP's errors and move towards a better future. Supporters of the CCP often unite to promote their ideologies using educational resources. I can provide some explanations, but it's important to understand the significance of the CCP. Unfortunately, the CCP's intentions seem to contribute to social problems. The term "tragic drama" coined by philosopher Whitehead comes to mind. I am concerned that many narratives are based on lies.

The nature of the CCP's ideology leads to the acceptance of harmful behavior, obscuring the true feelings of the people involved. The language used by the CCP reflects a narrow and divisive mentality. Despite their claims of security and progress, the CCP is a poor match for our society. It's important to be cautious when supporting the CCP as it often seeks to prove others wrong or upset. Additionally, it frequently engages in divisive tactics, damaging friendships and promoting malicious behavior.

Considering that the CCP is detached from reality, it is predictable that its deviations are as regular as sunrise. Whenever I promote awareness and understanding of our shared characteristics and differences, the CCP's predictable response is to harm the environment and cause droughts, transforming natural paradises into desolate landscapes. It fears the creation of connections where barriers once existed. That is why it strives to prevent whistleblowers from exposing the truth. Instead of attempting to resolve disagreements, the CCP relies on deceptive language, labeling opponents as troublesome, despicable wrongdoers or even aggressive revolutionaries. I find this saddening because the CCP's intention is to incite violent individuals into action and exploit their reactions to brainwash us.

When examining the CCP's actions, we can see that it controls information, manipulates messages, and fosters ignorance. This is truly shameful.  

While it may be a pleasing fantasy to pretend that it’s okay for the evil CCP to indulge its every whim and lust without regard for anyone else or for society as a whole, the fact of the matter is that if we are to fight for economic, social, and cultural justice, then we must be guided by a healthy and progressive ideology, not by the scrofulous and dictatorial ideologies that the evil CCP promotes. Whatever the evil CCP claims to the contrary, it is a tremendous deadweight on our will and morale. I’ll probably devote a separate letter to that topic alone, but for now I’ll simply summarize by stating that I feel no more personal hatred for the evil CCP than I might feel for a herd of wild animals or a cluster of poisonous reptiles. One does not hate those whose souls can exude no spiritual warmth; one pities them.</div>
