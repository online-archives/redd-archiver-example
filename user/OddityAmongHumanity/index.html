    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is the tolerance paradox. To allow tolerance, you must prevent intolerant views. Discussing these things seems small, but then you get more and more people discussing these things, until you get to the point we are at today with multiple white supremacist and neo nazi groups within America that pose a threat to our nation. You get to the point where enough people have hopped onto the bandwagon of the 2020 election being rigged and thus creating a threat to national security and our very institutions. When enough people are talking about and agreeing on the same thing, they're bound to believe it. So the issue becomes that of free speech versus a functioning society. Do we have completely free speech and a society that has significant groups with problematic views taking power, or do we suppress speech and limit the very freedoms that the developed world is founded on? Not to mention that limitations on speech can in of itself be an issue for a functioning society. I don't know the answer to this dilemma, and I don't think anybody does. I don't think there's any way to preserve a functioning society with freedom, nor is there a way to preserve it with totalitarian rule. I think humanity is doomed to swing back and forth between the two. Back and forth between a massive amount of slaves and a thriving middle class, back and forth between totalitarian rulers and champions of democracy, and back and forth between societies that tolerate everything, and those that tolerate nothing.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Because a lot of money has been spent to pit the right against the left in culture wars so that no truly progressive policies to help the American people can get passed. If your average conservative American has been conned into believing that the Democratic party are bolshevicks or want to abort children after birth, than the Democratic party has to shift right in order to maintain votes. Fox News, OAN, and many others have spent decades cultivating this fear of the left so that Republicans can pass policies for the "free market", and inevitably when it results in stagnating wages and rising prices, they can blame the democrats because their constituents will believe it, even though it was their very free market policies that made things worse. As long as these propaganda networks funded by billionaires exist, the conservatives will think that the left wants communism, litterboxes in classrooms, teachers telling children that being white is wrong, and whatever other nonsense they're spouting these days. These beliefs create fear, and fear, my friend, is far stronger than truth.</div>
