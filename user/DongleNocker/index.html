But as a business, they have the right and obligation to the advertisers to limit what is perceived as offensive.  Reddit isn't preventing anyone from seeing this content if they want to, they are preventing people who haven't agreed to see it from seeing it.

&gt; I mean they're talking about Russians using T_D to win Trump the White House. It's incredibly important that people be allowed to see what they want and decide for themselves to hide something away.

Nothing is stopping someone from deciding to see search it out and see it</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Some of those mods want you to think Slavery only happened in the American South and that Southerns themselves kidnapped the slaves from their homes in Africa to enslave, rape, and torture.   Reality:  Slavery is a very old human institution.   It was present all civilizations and still exists today.  Slavery even existed in North American long before Columbus's first journey, Africans had been enslaving other Africans for centuries before Europeans found themselves in need of labor after the native populations were decimated by diseases.   China had slavery well into the 20th century.  The feudal system in Europe was a system of enslavement of peasants.   England forced of their own people into "indentured servitude", shipped them around the globe, to be sold off upon reaching a colonial port. 

But if you try to mention any of this in society today, some people devolve into shit throwing monkeys. </div>
