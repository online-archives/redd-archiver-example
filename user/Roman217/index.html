    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Except that when people OBVIOUSLY speak out against the actual bad ones, the violent thugs who are looters or burning police stations, the media conveniently does a blanket defense grouping them in with the peaceful protesters as if people are racist for speaking against either of them. That's the problem. You say that the protesters and the rioters/looters are two different groups, well if that's true, then don't separate them when it's convenient for you but keep them grouped when people hate their actions.

The obvious example of this is that Antifa literally is a terrorist organization and Trump was right to declare them as such. However, the media defends Antifa even though they are a group responsible for inciting the violent protests, rioting/looting. They group Antifa in with the peaceful protesters in such a way where apparently it's a problem to speak bad against Antifa as if you're speaking against the peaceful protesters.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So in order to understand the situation, if you start from the very beginning in like the early 1900's, no question there was systemic injustice and racism, and then over time the laws were changed and now if we look at purely from a legal standpoint, there are zero laws which discriminate against minorities by the color of their skin. So from a legal point, the system itself is NOT racist anymore. As to the real point though: are there enforcers of this legal system who ARE racist and unfairly making it a stronger point to enforce the law against certain groups of people? The unfortunate answer to that is yes. And when that happens, do we also have a corrupt police/local government system which tries to hide/cover up these situations so as to avoid all the controversy when such a situation is exposed? The unfortunate answer to that is also yes.

But these situations aren't a reflection on the system itself. It's a reflection of corruption that exists both in the low level enforcers of the law (cops), as well as a reflection of their higher ups who protect them from their actions (not necessarily because they're also racist, but because they want to cover up and prevent controversy). So what's the solution to this problem? Unfortunately there isn't some quick fix, but I believe that we already have been doing A LOT to try to expose these situations when they happen and make sure the people responsible are punished. For example we have been trying to push for less lethal law enforcement with tasers. We have made a strong push for body cams to make sure that what cops do don't happen in secret. We allow for cops to be recorded and try to expose these situations when they happen.

If these protesters have suggestions for further improvements to the system, they should be offering those, not causing mindless senseless violence in response to something everyone agrees was wrong. To just suggest the system is racist and incite violence trying to burn it down solves NOTHING. It only makes the problem worse. Then if you add in the looters that makes it way worse. The looters basically validate what the racist people think instead of prove them wrong.</div>
