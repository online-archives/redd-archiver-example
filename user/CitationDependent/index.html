Why do studies put the IFR at 0.15% and Brazil has 520k deaths? That would put Brazils population far over 400m. 

Ah, because 520k is a fake number, falsely attributed to covid? That does make sense.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">\&gt;As many of you are probably aware at this point, there has been a growing trend of other subreddits' who have implemented both automatic and manual policies and processes to ban users of r/nonewnormal from their subs for simply participating here.

The mod completely ignores reality and pigeonholes the sub from it's enemy's perspective.

The reality is:

\&gt; As many of you are probably aware at this point, there has been a growing trend of other subreddits' who have implemented both automatic and manual policies and processes to ban users of r/nonewnormal from their subs for simply participating here. This indicates a growing push to have us ousted from reddit. Their current autobanning will not be enough for them and as a large contingent taking ownership of our removal, we will likely be gone shortly.

\&gt; What not to do: don't spam this sub with "I'm banned posts". If someone makes such a post, let them know that there is a manage push against us and we are all getting these messages. Also, don't brigade the subs who are sending the bans.

\&gt; What to do: we've created a back up at [www.whatever.com](https://www.whatever.com). Sign up there and when the super-mods get enough momentum to remove this sub from reddit, we'll be able to carry on over there.

Instead, the mod has no plan and basically takes the position that folks are brigading those groups...that they have been mass banned from? Doesn't even make since. 

Doesn't solve the issue of people posting about their bans. They will just get deleted and shadowban, leaving them confused. And it doesn't solve the issue of what happens when they ban the group. 

I feel vindicated in that I realized they were fucking up, and that they continue to do so.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;I am most definitely not saying that scientific knowledge that contradicts my narrative should be censored.

Yes you did. You said the NoNewNormal was intolerable. NoNewNormal offers valid scientific data performed by scientists according to the scientific method.

I know you don't really get what that means, so I will give you an example:

Fauci wrote in an email: if the IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) of covid is between 0.3 - 0.5%, then covid should be treated like the flu.

This is called "falsification" which was determined by a scientist called "Karl Popper" (he was a scientist, you can ask your cousin about him) as the way differentiate between science and pseudoscience, ie if there is no way to disprove a theory, then there can be no way to verify it and hence it is not science.

So, Fauci, who some would say is a scientist, gave a method of falsifying the idea that covid is a serious  problem requiring inordinate attention: the death rate.

https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/  
Most of the studies are from locations with overall COVID-19 mortality rates that are higher than the global average. The inferred median infection fatality rate in locations with a COVID-19 mortality rate lower than the global average is low (0.09%). If one could sample equally from all locations globally, the median infection fatality rate might even be substantially lower than the 0.23% observed in my analysis.

And in September, we can see that the WHO put the death rate far below the minimum bounds he'd set and therefore, it would be pseudoscience to refer to it as anything more.

Since you don't have anything to add, that is not pseudoscientific, I'll assume you'll have thanked me mentally and feel improved with the knowledge you know have or that your cousin has explained to you after reading my comment.</div>

You are saying that scientific knowledge that contradicts your cherished narrative should be censored. This automatically disqualifies you for making a judgement. Nothing else is required to disqualify you. You don't know who, what or how it was discovered, but because it would support a "no new normal" you call it "intolerable".

You can have a PhD in physics or another hard science, but that belief would itself still disqualify you. This is not a no true scotsman fallacy. Science has a basis and someone who directly refuses to accept the basic foundation is not able to then use that foundation to make any determination because they've began with a false premise.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm comparing one attack to another attack.

One is an attack based on censorship and the other was a military attack. In the military attack, they notified people what was happening and how to respond. That, I think, is a pretty standard way of dealing with an attack. In this, they did the opposite, they hid the attack and banned their own members for trying to inform their own side that an attack was happening.

\&gt;

So, I am a scientist. I have a science degree. I have been both leading and supporting author on many published studies. I currently help doctors get their papers published in major international journals. It seems that you assume you know more about science than I do, though. And you seem to feel you are able to appropriately discuss what would be scientifically intolerable. You don't have such qualifications though. This is obvious from what you have written, so please stick to what you know, which seems to be very little.</div>

You are in this sub to oppose censorship...but not really because it's ok when it is something you disagree with. Which means you are pro-censorship. In the wrong sub to be promoting your pro-censorship views.</div>

So, they are ganging up to censor, which is the focus of the current sub which we are in. I might not be remembered, but you can't even keep your current position straight.</div>

Let's ignore the fact that they keep forcing people on ventilators and refusing to give people any other treatment, which has been shown clinically to drastically reduce risk. 

It's funny how you compare people trying to find the truth to witches being burned at the stake. I don't think you will get the irony though.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, you can check the entire sub, there is not one mention anywhere of the 8 major subs autobanning. It's blocked throughout the group.

My shadowban seems to have started when a mod said this was old news and I said multiple new subs started doing it this morning and then that and every comment after that doesn't show up.

One of the greatest censorship campaigns in reddit history happens yesterday morning and by the end of lunch, all mention of it is removed, on the sub it is happening to on the day it is happening.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So, there was the exchange in modmail where a mod said I was shadowbanned for no reason and they would undo it, but they didn't undo it. And then there was the public comment that a mod replied to (even though the comment was shadowbanned). In it, the mod seems to be talking about:

"I am thinking of writing something up about how I feel"

Who gives a fuck how you feel, just let people know what happened:

8 new major subs have started banning members of this sub, you'll probably be getting notices from them, but we are all getting them. We understand this is probably going to lead to us being shut down, and we are considering back-up sites, if anyone has any suggestions, it might be good to make a pre-emptive account there.

Instead, they are throwing folks into confusion. Tifu and Aww are major subs and prior to yesterday, they never autobanned folks from NNN. But instead of being able to ask about it, NNN mod's just delete and silence you? It seems like they are on the targeting NNN side of the discussion. Or at least one or two of the mods are.</div>

I could understand being confused about it, since there has been r/offmychest and r/justiceserved has been autobanning r/nonewnormal users for months. But, I told the mod and they banned the comment I made pointing it out...

I myself got banned from 2 subs yesterday morning (that I've never been in) and lots of people were pointing out that many new groups were in on targetting the sub, but all discussion was deleted.

I have a lot of comments in that sub and they have banned me (I guess permanently) for even mentioning the new assault (I guess since they never actually banned me or sent me a message, my comments and posts just don't show up).

Do you understand the comment that the mod left? I don't even know what they are trying to say to justify it.</div>
