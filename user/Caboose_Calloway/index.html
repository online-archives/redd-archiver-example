<p>I'm not stating you are wrong and I'm happy to look into your point of view but saying this isn't Cultural Marxism is disingenuous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cultural Marxism is just an ideology. Like all ideologies it is based purely on belief. There is nothing provable or disprovable about something based on belief. Ideologies (all of them without reservation) are waste of time and therefore I refuse to deal with them. </p>
<p>On the other hand we have a most tangible series of attacks on a specific kind of people - Open Source software developers, places and people defending Free Speech and so on.  
</p>
<p>We have a probable causes for the attacks - Open Source software developers are providing means of secure communication and software resources alternative to commercial (invariably backdoored) software. They are also cutting on the bottom line of the biggest companies of USA. </p>
<p>We have opportunity - While the targets are usually well defended against cyber attacks they are foolishly open to social and economic attacks. We also know that contrary to what they claim CIA regularly conducts operations within the USA, including wet operations. They also conduct training and experiments on regular basis. With an extensive network and unlimited budget you can do this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We have precedent of similar attacks taking place.  Here is an example of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJtv6HOurLc">undercover FBI agent operating as crisis actor</a> in Burns - Oregon just a few days ago.</p>
<p>We have the precedent of deaths of Leader figures under suspicious circumstances. - Aaron Swartz, Ian Murdock, Michael Hastings... We have several <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2015/11/04/feminists-are-trying-to-frame-linus-torvalds-for-sexual-assault-claims-open-source-industry-veteran/">attempts at entrapment</a> targeting Linus Torwalds </p>
<p>At this stage whenever you see the term 'SJW' you can safely replace it with 'CIA Operative'. None of this has anything to do with ideology. These are field operations plain and simple. They have particular goals, definite targets and a precise plan of action. Leveraging various ideologies is part of that plan.</p>
<p>You are only helping them by making the ideology the focus of the debate. </p></div>

<p>What we see is an attack coordinated by a central entity and carried out by agents in the field. Whatever that central agency might be it is definitely not Marxist. </p>
<p>Their target is the Open Source Software community. So the most likely perpetrator is the CIA. This is as anti-marxist as it gets. </p>
<p>You are contributing to their attack by mislabeling them. If you are not sure what label to put on them you better refrain from putting any label at all. </p></div>

</p>
<p>My idea is to make every individual act like a tier-1 node but on personal level. In other words you agree to provide connectivity in a settlement free manner and other users connect to you under the same terms. </p>
<p>You also own the part of the infrastructure which is on your land. You own your router and the cables that go to the other flats and you also own the microwave p2p links on your balcony which connect you to other flats several miles away. For example a pair of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF_hx6iDIAM">these</a> sell for $190 on Amazon. </p>
<p>We can also talk about laying your own fiber. The technology for doing that exists too. </p></div>

<p>Currently GIT doesn't seem resistant to government pressure. But I believe it could become so with some work. </p>
<p>I think the most important think is the ownership of the infrastructure that makes up the internet. We must build completely personally owned networks where traffic can not be spied on by tapping on an AT&amp;T box. Not a Darknet but a rabbit hole of sorts, once a rabbit gets in you never know where it may come out. </p></div>

<p>&quot;Written by one of the foremost experts in high-performance computing and the inventor of Gustafson’s Law, The End of Error: Unum Computing explains a new approach to computer arithmetic: the universal number (unum).

This new number type obtains more accurate answers than floating-point arithmetic yet uses fewer bits in many cases, saving memory, bandwidth, energy, and power.&quot;</p>
