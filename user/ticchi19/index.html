    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I disagree with the idea that it is one rogue republican (or a few) pushing restriction on abortion at the federal level.  It's only optics and PR that make it seem like they push for a state only approach.  Instead they are using a state AND federal approach.  Many of these not passing isn't justification of a small government view. I just used him as an example as he set out bill and press release within 3 months of Roe v Wade and it was high profile. There were more introduced bills, by various congress people. Again, restrictions on health care for lgbtq folks is another that Republicans are very happy to try and regulate at the federal level.  The education department under Trump pushed changes that for the Republican model, instead of letting states continue to set curriculum and public education organization. 

Again, he did not match his the previous numbers,  he nearly doubled the number of executive orders of his predecessors (both Bush and Obama).  He reached those numbers in 4 years vs 8 for the other two and that cannot be explained away by just reversing previous EOs. His per year clip was 55 (the highest since Nixon), compared to 35 and 36 per year for Obama and Bush.  I agree, it would be nice if it was easier to find the data you are looking for.  I did peruse the list in his first year, and the majority seem to be new eo (not overturning previous ones). But it's hard to say for sure without tons of research. 

Here's some interesting data from the [Washington post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/23/both-democrats-and-republicans-care-about-states-rights-when-it-suits-them/). Both parties have passed similar number of preemption policies (limiting states power). But how they do it are different.  Democrats tend to implement floors (minimum standards) while Republicans have an ideological shift towards setting ceilings (states can only regulate to this degree). Both are restrictive of states' ability to self govern and they pass nearly equal numbers of bills doing so.  

As an aside, I think the democrats tend to do a really poor job in their implementation of floors.  You can work with states to set floors  and minimum standards that take into account each state's specific needs.  Take minimum wage as an example.  You can implement a federal minimum wage without setting a specific dollar amount.  Democrats push for raising minimum wage (there was a push for $15 not that long ago). But each state has vastly different economies.  Setting a number that works for both Arkansas and California doesn't make sense.  Instead, they could have a standard that says each state must adjust their minimum wage for poverty lines (hourly wages must result in workers being x% above poverty lines). States are welcome to do more than that, but a minimum standard of living must be achievable for any worker. 

All of this is to say that parties will consolidate power when convenient for them.  Whatever helps push their ideology further.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Sure, happy to have some civil discourse. Let's ignore how we feel about some of these topics and discuss them from purely a state vs federal level. Overturning Roe v Wade  was championed as a big win for state rights, pushing abortion laws to the states. However, within a few months of the decision, Lindsey Graham was introducing federal [anti- abortion laws](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/9/graham-introduces-legislation-to-protect-unborn-children-bring-u-s-abortion-policy-in-line-with-other-developed-nations#:~:text=The%20Graham%20legislation%3A,physical%20health%20of%20the%20mother.). 

This isn't unique to that issue either, add ons to bills have included restrictions to abortion pills, funding of health care facilities, etc that are all restrictions being proposed at the federal level. 

This isn't unique to abortion.  Restrictions on immigration policies, LGBTQ rights, and education curriculum (which has largely been set at state levels) have all been included in bills pushed by Republicans in both the house and senate at the federal level that take decisions away from state and local governments.  Many have not passed, so it's easy to miss.  But the bills not passing does not change the clear stance: it's up to the states unless they don't like a decision some states are making.  

This also applies to big vs small government. Republicans tout being against federal power, but have no problem using that power when it benefits them.  Trump signed 220 executive orders in 4 years of office, nearly matching the number signed by Obama (276) and Bush (291) in 8 years of office.  Bidden sits at 130 currently.</div>
