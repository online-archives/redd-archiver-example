    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I get the importance of <em>some</em> unit tests. But I don't think that they need to be done for everything. I don't agree with justletmevoat, but I also don't agree that we always need them. I think they are good for specific tasks that require either a lot of validation with a lot of moving parts, but I don't see them being useful for smaller things. Maybe because I haven't really done test-driven development, but the way I've seen them implemented in most cases seems like a waste of time.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I guess it's not really 'hardest' but as far as 'craziest thing discovered while fixing bugs' is this: </p>
<p>I was working for some academic testing software trying to find why the system had slowed to a crawl. I had some test accounts for admins and teachers. During this process I discovered that the passwords and all personal information was stored in the database in plain text. Okay that's pretty bad, but it gets worse. </p>
<p>I decide to follow the rabbit hole and here is what I discover: A user can 'change their password' and it will display their previous password in plain text. They can 'change' to a 'new' password, by using the exact same password they had previously used. Additionally, they could choose 'forgot my password' and it would show you a pretty standard security question and answer page. Only the questions and answers were user submitted, and could be left black. So you could choose any random user that you had an email for, click 'forgot my password', and security question would pop up that was likely blank, the answer field was also likely blank, it would display their old password and you could then change to the same password they were always using. </p>
<p>The sad thing is that when we brought this up, &quot;We wanted users to be able to know what they were currently using so that they didn't use the same password when changing it. We also wanted to allow them to choose a custom security question and answer as we feel this is better than the regular security questions other sites used&quot;. </p>
<p>Essentially, this is the best &quot;It's not a bug, it's a feature&quot; I've ever seen in real life.</p></div>
