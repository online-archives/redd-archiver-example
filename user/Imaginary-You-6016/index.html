I mean on the most basic level a "pitbull" is bull and terrier mix, they are "mutts" which makes labeling harder compared to say a germen shepherd, but a none pure breed with those 2 breeds in it is gonna be a "pitbull".</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah. I will always say owner and how a dog is raised is way more important, but dog breeds do have certain dispositions to strengths and psyches, larger dogs are naturally stronger, and some breed like "pit bulls" are stronger then similar size breeds. Likewise their psyche while not a hard and fast rule, do have certain dispositions. A good number of breeds are not met for just any owner, and certain breeds attract the wrong kind of owners. People really should not be getting certain breeds unless they have raised animals before and know what they are doing. A chihuahua for example might be small, but it is a hard headed breed and requires a knowledgeable owner, thankfully they are small so when they are raised badly their bites aren't bad, but don't think just size and strength alone is a indicator of breed psyche dispositions (just dawned on me chihuahua and shitzu, that would be a scary mutt in terms of psyche).</div>

In fact if you read the rules of this place, subreddits just having a bia's isn't the problem, its subreddits that claim to be impartial but aren't. For example, if you went to r/Conservative and said something that was against conservationism and got banned, it would be a "no shit" response from this community, as clearly they are bia's and don't hide that. r/news on the other hand claims to not be enforcing rules with a bia's, but as has been seen in many other posts they 100% do.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">TLDR: It doesn't look so, she was just committing fraud.

What caused this is that she has been using multiple names/alias including male names in official documents. If confirmation is wanted a review of her medical records would rule it out, but it currently looks like she may have been committing fraud as well leading up to this. Her drivers license has her listed as "female" though a autopsy report hasn't been released stating biology of her. This has resulted in a lot of misreporting and many news agency's to use this as a way to attack other news agency stating they are lying. Likewise some places are trying to use this to paint the person as transgender for their own motivates as well. The reality is it is being sorted out as things are being found amongst her possessions, but it looks like she has committed some extensive amounts of fraud for some time.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is why I like Florida's laws about crime, I think its called the "sunshine law" but basically, all crime is public recorded and made available with no filter involving adults. Frankly, I think it should be a federal law that all courts including states should have to follow it as well. Granted for Florida it creates the bad thing of "florida man" cause well crime data is so easy to access unlike most other states. You would think though states that care about transparency would want laws forcing the government to be transparent particularly around criminal justice which has historically used these "shady" area's to commit severe injustices to minority's.</div>
