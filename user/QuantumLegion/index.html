            Comment on: <a href="../../g/technology/post/diwg/gab-is-not-a-free-speech/#comment-ruqqus_15ir4">Gab is not a Free Speech Platform | by Claire Lovely | Sep, 2021 | Medium</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You can get porn anywhere now. It's not like when I was a kid, when you had to go to your uncles house and sneak in the attic or under his bed to find the good Playboys and Hustler mags while he was out talking to your dad in the garage, sweating in terror the entire time, listening for the door downstairs to pop open. If you want porn, all you have to do is click a button on your computer in the privacy of your own bedroom, and Viola! all the free naked you want. 

So this complaint is, to me anyway, silly. There's a niche for everything. You don't need to have Everything on every single platform. And if Gab and Parler don't want to host porn, well fine....go to freaking pornhub or redtube or whatever. Sheez. No one is stopping you.

If you really want to make an argument they're not free speech, lets talk about parler being a honey pot and Gab following in it's footsteps by making you become "authenticated" now to post so the Feds can track you. I have never been on Parler, and I went off Gab when they started that nonsense. That's a violation of free speech, and furthermore, blatant spying. 

But porn? Come on.</div>

Kudzu for instance, is highly nutritious. Dandelions are extremely high in Vitamins A, C and K with a little E and B. It also contains iron, calcium, magnesium and potassium. Raw flowers feature high levels of antioxidants and are considered anti-inflammatory. Cattails, wild asparagus, Calendula, milk thistle, clover, bamboo, wild onions, acorns, and I've just scratched the surface.</div>

I'm sure block chain is great---for people who are computer programmers. But until it becomes user friendly to those of us who are not, it's nothing more than another gatekeeper to access to the internet locking out us "inferior" beings who don't under the technology.</div>

Hell, drunk people will murder the robot for kicks. Fuck it, I'd murder the robot for kicks because they make funny noises when they die. Also, what the hell is the robot gonna do? Yell at you?

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, which is what I'm going for. I don't want to just learn front or back end. I want to learn both.  So yes, the name makes sense, since I'm going to be continuing my studies until I'm a fullstack developer. This is my personal blog of my journey into becoming a **fullstack** developer.

Just because someone gave me advice (and I appreciated that advice and took it under advisement) doesn't mean I'm going to follow it to the exact letter. I'm not a robot; I can make my own decisions. 

I posted it in that guild because one of the posters specifically stated I should make a guild to blog/ journal my progress and if I needed help, he would help me. I posted it to both show him I took his advice to do exactly that, and I was giving him the opportunity to follow up on that offer. I then invited him to help me mod the guild. 

So unless you have a point, I don't think berating me based on you erroneous assumptions about what I'm doing are very helpful. 

You may go now.</div>

1. I want a better paying job I can potentially do from home without having to interact with people. And I want to make a shit ton of money. Not so I can buy a Porche but because I allowed myself to fuck off too long and now I wonder if I'll be able to retire. I'm a frugal saver, but life costs more everyday, and I need to save as much as possible over the next 30 or so years if I want to not starve to death. Or at least keep making money when I'm 70 and can't walk.

2. I want to understand the increasingly complex technical terms I hear tossed around online about privacy, hacking, and future technology. I don't like Not understanding things. If I have a question, I'm the geek that will spend half the day trying to find out why an author makes a throw-away reference about the unusual mating habits of frogs--and my brain demands I know more. People's ignorance, lack of curiosity and laziness in not researching irritates the hell out of me. And that's what I'm (hypocritically) doing with Tech. I'm skimming tech guilds and articles but I have no idea what 3/4ths of it means. I'm just skimming and allowing myself to feel frustrated and ignorant in my lack of knowledge, which pokes at my sense of Self. And you can't just Duckduck most tech. You ask one question and you get 5K other questions, and terms you don't know, which takes you to another 10K terms/references you can't understand. 

3. I'm not a detail oriented person, but I'm extremely creative and a natural Problem Solver. I don't think I'd be happy inputting lines and lines of code/data without a visible end-game. It would get frustrating and boring pretty quick. But creating things would be like Writing---you're creating something from nothing, and to see that come alive on the screen would be amazing. Or having someone come to you and say, I have this issue, figure out the problem and fix it, would be fun to me. 

4. Hobby: I'm a hopeful writer, and frankly, Scrivner sucks ass (IMPO) and the few other world building/ writing apps are like video games -- lots of flash but nothing of substance, or so complicated I'd need another year of college in web design to figure their shit out. Its a pain in the ass, and makes my writing more difficult. I don't like not knowing how to solve a problem I have. If that means learning from the ground up on how to make a new writers program that at least has a decent thesaurus and doesn't look like something from the early 90's, then I'll take the time to do that. If it's just a side hobby that's fine--like a guy who builds houses making bird houses for fun. 

What all those mean to my end game, I don't know yet, because I don't know enough to make that decision. That's why I'm asking and exploring and talking to people who are smarter than I am--like you, so I can figure that out.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">What you're saying is awesome and I don't deny it. It's good advice. But the question is: How do I know? 

If I want to learn woodworking, I start at the bottom in middle school shop, right, and I build a pair of book ends. But until I learn how to build bookends, then a table, and then a bird house...and work my way up, I don't know if I want to build a house or a high end table out of rare bloodwood and teak that looks like a work of art you'd sell in a gallery. I'm not sure yet. I haven't decided because I don't have enough information. First, I have to learn how to make book ends, and when I'm done with that, I'll have a better idea of my strengths. Do I enjoy building something bare and functional...or do I want to be a woodworking artist with flair? I'll let you know when I get the basics down and I have more information to make that decision.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>In late 2018 the company admitted that this activity had helped fuel a genocidal anti-Muslim campaign in Myanmar for several years. 

I had to stop there. The Muslims in Myanmar have been attacking the people, engaging in outright terrorism, and guerilla warfare to FORCE the people/government into becoming Muslim. The war there is because of IMMIGRANT Muslim aggression, Muslim terrorism, and Muslim intolerance. And the people of Myanmar finally said, We've had enough, if the gov't can't fix this, let the military take over and SAVE us from these radical Islamic terrorists who aren't even natives, who want to destroy our way of life and force us to into Islam. So they did. And that's what is really going on in Myanmar. And every time I hear some jackass talk about Myanmar as if the Muslim's are "victims" I want to slap a mutherfucker in the balls. Sorry. I got mad at your article. 

FB Sucks. Don't use FB. Thank you.</div>
