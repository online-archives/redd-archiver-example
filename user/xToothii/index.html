    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I've heard this argument about a million times. It has some actual basis, sure, but it doesn't change the fact that T_D broke the ToS. If I had said "lol T_D is bad because they ban everyone who disagrees", then that argument probably would have made a lot more sense (as a counter). However, that's not what I was trying to point out. I am simply saying that T_D broke the ToS, and r/politics did not. It really doesn't go much farther than that unless you take into account my personal political opinion, which only serves to supplement the argument I'm making (rather than form the entirety of it). Although, it seems to be distracting you a little *too* much, so if you like, I can just leave that stuff out. That way, you have nothing to disagree with in my argument except for Reddit's ToS... which isn't really my problem. In fact, it's 100% a *you* problem.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1. I'm not saying that nobody on r/politics has said something that broke the ToS. The difference is that the moderators of that sub *actually banned them*. Meanwhile, T_D's mods remove anything and everything that even slightly criticizes their Orange God Emperor, and leave everything else (including death threats and the like) intact until someone calls them out on it.

2. Like I said, it's not about the actions of a few. It's about the inaction of the moderators on this kind of behavior. I can get banned in less than twenty-four hours for saying manmade climate change is a scientific fact, yet it would take a week or two and a ton of negative exposure from subs like r/TopMindsOfReddit to get a simple death threat removed. Does that sound fair to you? No, of course not. 

3. My "narrative" will work just fine when presented to an *actual* free thinker, because I use common sense and factual information in my arguments. True  purveyors of independent thought don't feel the need to call themselves "free-thinkers", because they know their way of speaking easily communicates that to any rational human being.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Did you even read what I actually wrote? Or are you just *that* fucking retarded? I'm gonna go with the latter, because you've given me plenty of reason to. But, I'll address your points anyways, because I honestly have nothing better to do.

1. I never said T_D was super evil, and you know that. They still broke the rules though, so their getting quarantined was absolutely justified. You also know that I never said everything else on Reddit was all puppies and rainbows. There are a lot of pther political subreddits I don't like, many of them being left-wing, but unlike T_D, they didn't violate Reddit's ToS. 

2. Ah yes, the oldest trick in the book... calling everyone you disagree with a "shill" or "russian bot". And yes, I am aware that the left wing uses the latter frequently. I'm not a fan of that, either. But either way, it's all in the same vein as calling something "fake news"... if you don't like the truth, just make up your own version of it, right? We call them "alternative facts" where I'm from.

3. Again, I never said censorship would lead to a more "harmonious society", or whatever the fuck you just pulled out of your ass. I don't give a damn whether T_D is or is not quarantined, but I'll defend Reddit's decision any day, because they were in the right. If r/conservative got quarantined, I would have argued against Reddit's decision, because I don't agree with it (unless they broke the ToS, which I don't think they have so far). But, ultimately, they are a private company, so they can do whatever the hell they want in regards to censorship. I "super believe" everything you just said was a strawman argument, because, *again*, I didn't say any of those things. Not even close. 

If you would like to try again, please insert five bullshit coins. Your current balance: 999 999 999+</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I already explained to you why it isn't immoral. T_D continuously failed to comply with Reddit's ToS, so they got banned. If anything, I'd argue that they were treated *better* than other subs with similar violations, and the reason for that is obvious - spez knew this would happen. He knew that T_D users would go nuts over this, and use the ban as evidence to support their claim that Trump supporters are "oppressed" by Reddit, the media, the deep state, and any other metaphorical balls of shit they thought would stick to the ceiling. It's extremely ironic, actually - the same people who throw a hissy fit every time they see someone playing the victim are now trying to victimize themselves. I'm shocked. Really, I am (just kidding, of course I'm not). In the end, they can cry censorship all they want, but I hope they don't expect anyone to take them seriously (I know I sure as hell won't). And of course, I'm sure they'll continue to call themselves "free thinkers", because that's *definitely* what they are.  Having a temper tantrum just like u/spez predicted they would... yup, that's the *exact* thing that comes to mind when I think of the phrase "independent thought". *Totally.*</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">What else were they supposed to do? Reddit, as a corporation, has every legal right to censor whomever they want. If it makes their platform look bad (primarily to advertisers, because money fuels ethics when it comes to corporations), of course they're gonna censor it. Same exact thing YouTube does. I'm not saying it's right, but that's the way it works. They are not a government entity. They are not bound by the First Amendment. You have every right to complain about this, but not to cry foul in legal terms.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Completely censored? Dude, it was quarantined, chill. And besides, there was a perfectly valid reason to quarantine it too. The last time I visited there, I saw people practically pissing on John McCain's grave and implying that they were happy he was dead. Reddit's been easy on T_D for a loooooooong time, but we all knew (including the members of the subreddit themselves) that this was eventually gonna happen. When T_D's mods start actually caring about death threats and other ToS breaches, they'll get unquarantined. But until then, they will have to face the consequences of their uncivil political discourse. Don't worry, all you sane conservatives still have r/conservative, unless all of the T_D scumbags migrate there (which will probably happen anyways).</div>
