It was a spearfishing campaign and various Republican accounts were hacked as well.  And just like that, a bunch of Republicans became Putin's best friend just like Trump.

I'm not even going to talk about your deranged, unhinged conspiracy theory.  Do yourself a favor and watch one of Biden speeches before you repeat this bullshit about cognitive decline.  Then go watch one of Trump's.  Not the highlights, every single minute of both fucking speeches.  You can't bend reality to your wishes.</div>

Yes there is an effort to recruit minorities and that is somewhat working.  However, when we look at the data from recent elections, Biden support is quite strong including minorities.

Nice attempt to flip the script, but there's a reason why the Republican side of the aisle is all white, except for Tim Scott who just got his ass handed to him in the presidential primary.</div>

There's a good damn reason why you only have like two black people on that side of the aisle, it's all white. Meanwhile people like Ron DeSantis running for president tried to ban African American history from being taught, and may comments that slavery was good for the slaves....  And you wonder why over 90% of African Americans vote with us democrats, it's because we have always had their back.

If your game here is to attempt and point out racial disparities on both sides of the aisle, you're going to lose this game bro.</div>

I guess Obama was a racist too for picking this guy as his vice president huh? Either that or you have taken these quotes out of context and ignored an awful lot about Biden's public career.

Worry about the racism on that side of the aisle, and maybe you'll do better in some of these elections!</div>

It's weird like the polls have consistently been wrong, almost like they're funded by those.pushing a narrative...

Just look at this election last night, the "polls" had the Democrat ahead 4 points, but he won by 8 points.

Democrats have outperformed the polls in all these last special elections which they have won, and this one stings for you, this was a swing district.

Well at least Americans got one thing right, Biden is old.  Pretty crazy that such an old senile guy has passed the most legislation since LBJ.</div>

Most Americans reject the gop's stance on abortion and the elections have been showing that without fail.  Most Americans actually support very little restriction on abortion, roe versus Wade had it right with fetal liability.

Exceptions require a police report, I.E. a "proof" of rape... There are also supposed to be exceptions for the life of the mother, but the way it's working out is that women are nearly dying in parking lots... and doctors are leaving those idiotic red States.  Don't believe me? Just look at the six Texas women that are suing Texas because their lives were put in jeopardy by these laws.</div>

 He's going to be coming unhinged before your very eyes. 

 We both know that immigration has been a problem for years it's just that Trump came at it like a dunce, first he said Mexico would pay for it, a lie, then he actually tried to take money away from our military to build it.  And yes there was a new policy to separate families including ripping crying babies from her mother's arms.  Put in by Jeff sessions.  You don't really need me to point out the poisoning of the blood rhetoric that Trump uses is directly from Hitler do you?  I think you're smart enough to know that and you just like people like Hitler.

We finally have a bipartisan Congressional deal and Trump scuttles it because he's a total dipshit that hates America.  Billions for the border, approved by the border patrol Union that is decidedly Republican leaning, the deal worked out by immigration Hawks in the Republican party, was scheduled by Trump because he doesn't really care about the border, he just wants to get back to making those millions at his hotels.

Did you see how Trump made millions of dollars from China on his tax returns, what's up with that shit? And you really want to talk about Hunter Biden's job, really? Get help.</div>

Jared got two BILLION dollars from the Saudis right after leaving the white house.  After having a top secret clearance that was rejected but then overruled.  After the Saudi fund advisor said the money should not be invested because kushner had no experience running a hedge fund.

You really think you're a patriot defending these assholes?  CHARISMA IS SUCH A NOTHING BURGER COMPARED TO TRUMP AND HIS HUNDREDS OF STOLEN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE HIS UNQUALIFIED FAMILY MEMBERS WERE DOING IN THAT WHITE HOUSE LIKE A GODDAMN THIRD WORLD COUNTRY</div>

Yes Hunter Biden got a cushy job due to his dad's name but the prosecutor actually was investigating burisma so you have it backwards.

There's only one reason that deal failed, and that's because Trump told them to vote no.

Because he wants the problem to be worse for his campaign.

We support ukraine, we support israel, not to help them, but to help our own national security.  That's not omnibus, those are crucial issues that have broad bipartisan support.

Funny thing about that last election, people mentioned Republicans sabotaging the border deal.</div>

Anyway, who cares about any of that shit right? Let's talk jobs.  I like the strong economy and strong job creation under the Biden economy.  I'm worried that if Trump gets in again we will once again lose millions of jobs.  He will once again give tax cuts to the wealthiest in society.

I like how Biden implemented the 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.

I like how Biden isn't a megalomaniac douchebag that makes Hitler quotes and has talked about "dismantling the Constitution"

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes they barely got the house but the "red wave" was much less seats than Obama lost or Trump lost.  At this point they barely hold it and their sham impeachment wouldn't have even passed.

Who holds the Senate Einstein?  Ya lost that.

Since 2020 Democrats have outperformed in every single election.  In this district it was a +8 republican win to a +8% Democrat win.  

Anyone that knows shit about politics knows this was a crucial seat and that's why Republicans spent millions upon millions in that district, Einstein.

You people are known for your Rose colored glasses.  "Everything is fine sir!  Best army in the world mr. Putin sir!"</div>

Trump definitely colluded by spreading stolen emails hacked by a Russian operative gleefully spread through WikiLeaks.  He literally stands with Putin and says he believes him over our intelligence services.

There were 100 documented meetings between the Trump campaign and Russians where they promised to lift sanctions.  

Now Trump is making sure Ukraine doesn't get any more aid so Daddy Putin can finish his terrorist invasion.

Joe Biden called out Putin from the beginning.

Trump is melting down, you bet on the wrong fucking horse LMFAO</div>
