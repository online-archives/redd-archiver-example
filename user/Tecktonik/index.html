    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>This seems kind of like an argument against &quot;You aren't going to need it!&quot; by saying &quot;It will turn out useful later on.&quot; Of course that is how a lot of Factory classes get started in the first place. The underlying intention is to prevent technical debt: give an object a life cycle, first construct, then initialize, so you don't have to pay off the debt of adding the life cycle later on. The downside of this is that changes to init() might screw up the life cycle in an invisible way, so you still have to track down all the places where the class is instantiated to make sure they still work, because if you don't you must be willing to eat the technical debt you were only pretending to avoid in the first place. It is a risk either way.</p>
<p>If you are repurposing an init() method to recycle an object, you create a sizable risk of introducing inconsistent state, or possibly leaking data from the old state into the new state. You can't safely use init() to turn an old object into a just-like-new object unless your init() method also restores sensitive properties to their default values - something an init() method wouldn't normally be concerned with.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>You have to strike a balance with how much work is done in a constructor. If you move &quot;unnecessary&quot; code out of the constructor, but still require some kind of init() to be called, then you will end up building Factories, and you can never have just one Factory. But if the factory is calling the slow Init() code you moved out of the constructor, all you have done is added complexity for no actual benefit.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>99% of people would recommend some language, usually something that has a large open source community surrounding it. I think that provides way too much of a safety net, if you are stumped by a problem and it only takes you 5 minutes to find a solution on Google then you are going to solve your problem but not benefit from the experience of trying lots of wrong things. Also everyone wants something practical they can use later on, but that just makes them more likely to get stuck in a rut, they get attached to the first tool they use, they cling to its idiosyncrasies and never know what else is out there.</p>
<p>So my recommendation is to go to Google Drive and create a new Google Sheets document. The spreadsheet is your canvas. You will need to create a challenge for yourself to make the spreadsheet do something interesting, but here's one to start: write a program that whenever you put an 'x' in one of the cells, your program will draw a dot '.' in the surrounding cells. The first thing you will have to figure out is how to attach code to the spreadsheet. They use a language call Apps Script that is based on Javascript. You will have to learn a bunch of useless things about Apps Script to get your code working, and you will never have a use for that knowledge outside of the Google platform, but you will pick up some skills in the process - or perhaps you will fail miserably. Good luck.</p></div>

A lot of that experience is looking at code actually being used in production and figuring out what it would take to fix bugs / add new features. Deal with enough technical debt and it becomes easier to spot. Working with code written by low cost developers in India or wherever is also a good learning experience.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The first example, processing a csv file and putting the data into a database, isn't really complicated enough for the structure to really matter. The only critical issue with that example is abstracting out file paths and user credentials. Otherwise the task for this example is a straightforward procedure.</p>
<p>The second example is such a clunky programming exercise I would assume it was originally chosen for its didactic value, since there is nothing practical about a coin flipping program.</p>
<p>In the third example, Will takes actual structured code and turns it into a maintenance nightmare. I have seen this type of thinking in a production system, &quot;Hey, let's just turn these nested conditionals into a switch statement with 25 cases.&quot; Depending on the lifespan of the project, it can become a complete quagmire. It also tends to propagate itself into other code, since the choice of conditional logic (instead of a collection of objects) here will mean there is no layer of abstraction for other code to take advantage of, and another process, possibly dealing with the exact same collection of meaningless strings, will have to use switch logic as well. Using procedural code here is a decision to choose the option with loads of technical debt.</p>
<p>In the fourth example, Will shows that his procedural approach is better by producing an object oriented design. I am confused how this supports his original thesis that OO code is bad.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It is part of the &quot;rock star programmer&quot; appeal of the profession. Programmers have been in such high demand for so long, it has attracted a lot of inexperienced folks who want to get a foot in the door. If you want to be a literal rock star, you have to already know how to play your instrument, you can't go in all like &quot;Well I studied music theory for three years and I've been playing the guitar for 3 months&quot; and expect to get recognition for your knowledge. You can't <em>want</em> to be a rock star, you have to simply <em>be</em> a rock star, and of course some people are better at assuming this attitude than others. You can't be willing to <em>learn</em> a new framework on the job, you have to <em>know</em> the framework, even if that just means you've been reading a bunch of blogs can make smart remarks about the latest beta features - &quot;I am really looking forward to dynamic threading in the next release, it is going to make things so much easier!&quot;</p>
<p>Also I find it strange that people now place an emphasis on the difference between OOP and procedural programming. They are orthogonal to each other. Declarative versus procedural is more meaningful.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The conclusion - &quot;we have evidence of bias against women&quot; - is a bit strange, and should really be evidence of a bias against outsiders of known gender. As for the theory of survivorship bias, that seems pretty clear. Considering that males outnumber females by an order of magnitude, there is far greater competition between the males. More competition means even the most skilled programmers have to withstand peer scrutiny, and many of those peers are, quite frankly, retarded monkeys.</p></div>

<p>1. Don't repeat yourself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-1. Don't optimize prematurely. Abstraction to save five single lines of repeated code in two files might seem like a good idea, but it might also hide important information and made the code harder to understand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7. Follow the boy scout rule</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-7. No good deed goes unpunished. If you disturb something that doesn't belong to you, be prepared to deal with the consequences tomorrow, or next week, or two years from now.</p></div>
