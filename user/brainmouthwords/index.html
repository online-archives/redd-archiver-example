No, you said you didn't know. And then you speculated. And then you edited your comment to say that according to google and chatgpt, the definition is debated. Which is another way of saying **we don't know.**

> This is extremely circular logic and in bad faith.

It's bad faith to ask who determines what constitutes an assault rifle?

> Words have meaning.

Maybe they don't have as much meaning when nobody knows who came up with the definition, when there's zero enforcement of that definition in the industry to which it applies, and when any hypothetical legislation would side-step the issue entirely by individually listing each make/model they were trying to ban.</div>

And it's highly likely that nobody who wants to ban the AR-15 would change their mind after learning that it's not an assault rifle. But it's also important that we use this particular definition when discussing them.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> The vast majority of Democrats are liberals

The majority of people who **identify** as Democrats are liberals. But the majority of people who **vote** for Democrats are not. And the reason for this is, as you said, because often the only alternative to shitty neolib/privatization ideas is crypto-fascism.

To put it another way: Let's say there are two candidates for president. One of the candidates promises to give everyone a free puppy, while the other candidate promises to give everyone diarrhea forever. Now, just because I vote for the puppy candidate doesn't necessarily mean I like dogs. Maybe I'm extremely allergic to dogs, but decided that was less of a concern than the prospect of shitting myself to death.

Now imagine that the first candidate has a bunch of dog-loving supporters who are convinced the rest of the country loves dogs as much as they do. So they're convinced that their political party should double down on dog related political policies, investment, etc. Meanwhile me and like 75% of the people who voted for the dog guy are like yea dogs are cool but we're mostly just happy not to be force-spraying shit out of our asses.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> Right. Two different desired economic systems. 

Actually, no. It's the same economic system. The only reason you're saying they're different is because you lean politically to the right, and most of the folks on your side think that anything to the left of "You should have to pay cops before they actually help you" is Stalin-era communism.

A few quick questions for you: Did you ever attend public school or a publicly funded university? Have you ever been to a library? Have you ever driven on the interstate, or even just a paved road? Have you ever read the Nutrition Facts label on food that you've purchased? Because all of these things have existed in the US for quite some time, despite the fact that none of them require privatization.

> I’m not sure how you’re not supporting my point here.

Well the point you're trying to make is wrong, and I don't support things that are wrong.

> Most Democrats are liberals

Simply amazing. You can literally tell a conservative that people on the Left don't use the word Liberal anymore. You can straight-up tell them that Lefties have known for **years** that when someone uses the word liberal to describe themselves, they're actually conservatives pretending to be Lefties.

You can spell the entire thing out for conservatives, and they're still so socially illiterate that they'll just respond with "Nuh-uh they call themselves liberals all the time!". Jesus Christ.

> Leftists have always been on the margins as anti-privatization fringe groups that provoke occasional discourse.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Nope. The only way that they're two different economic systems is if you're 15 years old and the entirety of your political understanding comes from playing Hearts of Iron and lurking on /pol/.

But in the Real World, most countries (including the US) make use of both privatization and government-run services. And none of them had to switch to a different economic system to accomplish this.

Basically liberals think "Hey if we paid a private company more money to do this instead of the government then the quality might improve!" While Leftists think "Hey we've been trying this privatization thing for like 40 years and all it did was make everything shittier and more expensive."</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The biggest difference between Leftists and Liberals is that Leftists LOVE guns. The second-biggest difference is that there haven't been any Liberals in the US in almost 20 years. This isn't a joke: people on the Left don't call themselves as liberals anymore, and they haven't for a long time. 


This is why it's so easy for regular people to spot political nonsense on the internet. All you have to do is look for a comment where someone refers to themselves as a Liberal, and then you know there's like a 95% chance the thread is filled with russians and/or maga people.</div>
