    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's a cop out answer. 

It would probably create more jobs. But then you also have to factor in the added strain of what a universal healthcare system would bring - people being far more liberal about what they go to the doctors/hospital for (last time I went to A&amp;E there was a woman there who was concerned about having dirrahea, and who knows what other silly reasons people waste doctors time on when they know they don't have to pay for the the service), the added strain that would put on staff, and you have to factor in whether or not the current infrastructre is enough, or would more hospitals/general pratices/walk in centers have to be built, and how much that would cost? </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Raise taxes by how much? What about the issues that stem from raising taxes in an already struggling economy? How much do you divert from the military to a universal healthcare system? A lot of jobs would be lost, and if those people who lose their jobs then struggle to find work afterwards they might then have to go on welfare, which would wind up costing more. Plus you've already raised their taxes. Not to mention the ramifications on the geopolitical standing of the US.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;why does their military need to be many times larger than anyone else?

Completely irrelevant to this conversation. And you didn't answer the question, again, what about the ramifications of reducing the military budget? You've no doubt given absolutely zero thought about the many jobs that would be lost, and the impact it would have on the countries geopolitical standing.

I'm not against universal healthcare at all, but I'm capable of understanding that it isn't realistic for the US to implement such a system without completely crippling their society. Unlike you. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No, you didn't. Not in a way that actually explains how to implement anything you claim is so simple and readily available. All you have is "just google it", or "I'm not writing an essay". Which is funny, because if it was such an easy thing you would actually be able to give a concise answer.

You can look at other countries, but as I've already said, the dynamics are different - The cost of setting up a system like that in a country the size of the US would be astronomical (once again I repeat, a very large country with trillions worth of debt already). How much of the military budget do you cut? And what of the ramifications of reducing that budget? </div>
