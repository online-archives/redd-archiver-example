    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are lying no one who was against trump before is with him now. Jeez you people are sad. I literally said I do not watch cable news or tv and watch him and what he says and tweets and you still fucking think you can tell me my sources are bad. Fuck it is infuriating even attempting to give you the benefit of a doubt. Trump supporter have nothing NOTHING to add to any fucking conversation. Trump has done literally nothing good since being in office but I am wrong for thinking he is a moron. At what point is my observation of what trump is doing valid? Why is what my eyes see and hear TRUMP do not matter? I am not quoting a fucking news organization here. I am telling you based on what he has said, tweeted, acted, and done that I heavily dislike trump at all. No news there. No brainwashing. Just simple assessment after literally paying attention to DONALD TRUMP and not a fox (or literally any other) news anchor is telling me. I find his policies incredibly short sighted, his demeanor deserving of everyone's reproach, and his "leadership" utterly dismal.

&amp;#x200B;

And guess what? Unlike you I am able to say I didnt need a news anchor to come to that understanding. Unlike you I am not just accepting what I am being told to feel. I have every reason to dislike trump and am left with none to justify him in any manner.

&amp;#x200B;

You should actually try making up your own mind for once instead of projecting the situation you made for yourself on others.

&amp;#x200B;

fyi: I am blocking you now. I have no time to continually explain how someone is being exactly what they are saying is bad. Trump is an evil indiviual and one day will be completely understood in history as being an embarrassment to the country. That is your reality, no different than all the bigots and shitty ideologue people that came before you. You ARE on the wrong side of history. You are also a liar.

" I actually do want to hear opposing views, which is why I post in subs that are in opposition to what I believe. These kinds of conversations are important imo so I welcome them. If you can't understand where Trump supporters are xoming from I feel that you're only ingesting the news that fits your bias already. " you undermine your own self one sentence to the next.  

You are not smart or clever or above reproach. You are one more ignorant of a trump supporter that will live the rest of your life thinking his is a rad dude. You are a sad human and am done talking to you now and enjoy the idea that soon you will have to live with the fact the rest of fucking world is happy he isnt president, was impeached, and hopefully jailed. I take my wish of good luck back. You dont need luck you have the imaginary support of god and trump so.........</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes and I have taken the time to actually look at my own beliefs in this matter and can easily side with the one that watns progress. At this point I sincerely dont know what most republicans are even defending regarding most political policies. I sincerely dont know what they think there is to defend in trump or hate about in regards to more left leaning ideologues. I have no clue what we are defending privatized medicine for, no clue why we are defending privatized prisons, schooling, college....ect. These things clearly could be working much better and there a lot of examples for most of these topics and yet republicans flip when we talk about taxing the super rich as if trickle down economics was magically working for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because a group of people disagrees doesn't mean you can just assume they are simply brainwashed and arent actually thinking. If that is the case then you are the authoritarian thinking we need to live how you say.

&amp;#x200B;

What is happening now in politics is horrid. We are all Americans and should be on each others sides and instead we are arguing whether or not rich people deserve to hold all of the money we helped them get. We argue about what truth is and sit on our positions as if we already had truth to begin with. Evidence of crime isn't enough for anyone anymore on almost all fronts. Whether the evidence clearly indicates a president is doing illegal things, whether the planet is hot, cold, flat or round. Whether vaccines are liquid autism or any of the other asinine things that is now a point to argue.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things just are what they are and other things will never be a perfect or solid truth. All of us understanding our general motivations and wishes might be a good starting point to as to where to begin finding the truth that we all have to make as a society. Rather than immediately side with republican or democrats. There is a severe lack of actual  critical thinking and just as much practice of people barricading themselves into views that they themselves dont understand why they keep.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of your Opposition isnt blind at all. Some of the people who have these beliefs take the time to understand them. I can not say I see this from a vast majority of trump supporters. Honestly I can't, all shit talk aside I regularly see trump supporters continuously quote platitudes or out right incorrect information. I have yet to see one valid reason for sticking up for trump and that right there is why so many people disagree with you on reddit. An internet based semi democratic system that allows for the complete freedom of speech. HOWEVER freedom of speech doesnt mean "well most people are talking this way so they are all brain washed" isnt you doing your due diligence. A huge portion of the public dont even need news to let us know how to feel. I say this as one of them sense I dont own cable and dont watch news programs. So I have to read and watch trump myself. The picture he paints for me is one that I wish no one has to deal with but that isnt reality and I have to be part of the voice against what I see to be wrong morally, ethically, and lawfully. At this point if you have read this far and you see my last paragraph and want to write me off as brainwashed then it really was fruitless typing any of this because someone elses position isnt something you actually care about. You just want any position that doesn't agree with yours to be closer to your own. You dont want to grow at that point you just want things to be easy and not work on changing your deeply held beliefs.</div>
