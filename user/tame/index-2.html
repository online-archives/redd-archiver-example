<p>The new 'atoi' looks good for what you want, the only thing I'd suggest is avoiding the call to pow() since it's generally slow and you can easily live without it. Also it might be more readable to write 48 as '0', it does exactly the same thing but the next person to read the code might not know that 48 = ASCII '0' off the top of their head:</p>
<pre><code>value = 10 * value + (inputArray[i] - '0');

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Sure. :) First up, I'm a bit of a dinosaur in terms of embedded systems and so what I'm saying applies to old, tiny micros. Even on a modern 'small' chip like an AVR or similar you can probably get away with treating it like a little desktop computer. That said...</p>
<p>Generally in embedded software development, static memory allocation is favoured over dynamic allocation. Embedded systems often have very limited processing power and memory, and are expected to run reliably for long periods of time. They're also sometimes hard to debug due to the difficulty of getting reliable debug information out of them.</p>
<p>Static allocation is simpler, eliminates memory leaks and a whole bunch of other potential pointer issues, and generally is a better option in embedded development.</p>
<p>In this case you could do something like this (whoops, I was just going to write some pseudocode... :P )</p>
<pre><code>// Parses an integer, terminated by a US character, from 'str' starting at the
// given position. Updates the position if found, otherwise returns false.
bool parseInt(char *str, int&amp; pos, int&amp; val) {
    int end = pos;
    // Find the first non-numeric character
    while ('0' &lt;= str[end] &amp;&amp; str[end] &lt;= '9')
        end++;
    // If the next char isn't an US, then fail
    if (str[end] != US)
        return false;
    // Parse the value
    str[end] = 0;
    val = atoi(str+pos);
    str[end] = US; // NOTE: Don't need this if we don't use the string again
    pos = end+1;
    return true;
}
bool parseDispenseRequest(char *input, int&amp; position, int&amp; currency, int&amp; amount) {
    int curpos = 0;
    return parseInt(input, curpos, position)
        &amp;&amp; parseInt(input, curpos, currency)
        &amp;&amp; parseInt(input, curpos, amount)
        &amp;&amp; (input[curpos] == RS);
}
</code></pre>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The first thing to look for when you get this kind of &quot;I change some random other thing and it starts/stops working&quot; behaviour is some kind of memory corruption. Check the limits on all your loops, double check memory allocation/deallocation (if you're using it, which on a microcontroller you probably don't want to), make sure every pointer is initialized properly. Chances are, your allocating and freeing the array changes the layout of the rest of your data in memory in just the right way so that whatever bad memory access is happening now happens to some less important memory.</p>
<p>Onto the code... You probably want to change allocCharBuffer() so that it allocates and initializes (numberOfChars+1) bytes, not (numberOfChars) bytes, to make room for the terminating NUL character at the end of the string. My guess is your code is crashing when you call atoi() on an unterminated string.</p>
<p>When you allocate your string, this causes your next allocCharBuffer() to land in some other chunk of memory which, chances are, is already initialized with zeroes, which is why it works in this case (for a while).</p></div>

Any time you're trying to figure out &quot;how much&quot; instead of just &quot;whether or not&quot;, things get a lot more interesting. (A topical example would be driverless cars - you don't want the car to be doing &quot;if (x) turnLeft(); else if (y) turnRight();&quot;, you want it to be doing &quot;adjustWheel(calculateBestSteeringDelta(inputs));&quot;</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It depends hugely on who you work for, but generally it's high pressure and low pay compared with other commercial software development. You're solving much harder problems than your standard business application, and more of them, with less budget (in both time and money) to do it in. Your game is probably at the mercy of studio or VC funding and could get cancelled at any time (and your job along with it). And there's always an army of university grads willing to do your job for peanuts just so they can work in the game industry.</p>
<p>On the plus side, company culture is usually fun (obviously varies) and you learn a lot.</p>
<p>If you're going to be a professional game developer, do it before you have kids.</p></div>

<li>Programming text editor with syntax highlighting and automatic indenting = Document/View architecture (ie. MVC design pattern, although I ballsed it up and put all my 'model' code in the view... you learn by making mistakes :P ), text handling, caching</li>

It takes a little while to parse and tag source but after that it's fairly quick, and it's got good code navigation and alright code completion. Git and SVN integration built in along with a bunch of other nice things like CppCheck, UnitTest++, wxCrafter etc.</p>

It's not just &quot;guy starts making whiny SJW noises then quits.&quot; It's &quot;guy starts making whiny SJW noises and gets instantly banned by project owner with no discussion.&quot; He then quit the community in response.</p>
<p>No matter how annoying you find the whiny SJW noises, banning someone outright with no discussion based on a difference of opinion is poor form.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>True about the old bugs equals malware thing. I think the current approach is arguably optimal: With each new revision of the software, provide a sandboxed, virtualised version of the old version for compatibility. If I understand right, the &quot;compatibility mode&quot; in every Windows since 7 is literally a mini-VM running an older Windows runtime. This gets all the hacky workarounds out of the current-generation code while perfectly preserving the old execution environment.</p></div>

<p>As a side note, even with garbage collection you still need to be aware of memory management and avoid &quot;leaking references&quot; to heavyweight objects and so stopping them from being garbage collected. (The classic case is sticking a reference to an Activity into a static variable, at which case that entire Activity with all its child views and resources etc. just sticks around forever until the static variable is overwritten.)</p></div>

Make sure you finish each project - completing projects is a skill that many programmers lack. The more projects you've seen through from start to finish, the more you'll learn about good design. Look at open source projects if you need example code. Read up on design patterns, but don't get obsessed with them.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>A great read, but times have changed a lot. The only truly general advice about optimization is &quot;profile your code, try to make the slowest bits faster, then re-profile your code to see whether it worked.&quot;</p>
<p>As I understand it (and I'm not an optimization specialist so I could be off-base here) on modern compilers and on desktop or server computers you want to avoid micro-optimizations like the ones listed here because the compiler does all that and more, and knows far more about the CPU you're running on, the states of the registers, etc than you do. Stick with making your code more efficient, precomputation, caching, algorithmic optimisations (for instance choose an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm over an O(n<sup>3</sup>) algorithm and stay the heck away from exponential and higher orders unless really necessary). When you need that last 10% the top things to look at are cache performance and branch prediction type stuff. And again, always profile because you can get the weirdest interactions going on. Your intuition may/will be wrong but the numbers don't lie. Usually.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Sounds like a cool idea, basically use your existing web cache as a giant lookup table. The tricky bit is how you let the web server know what images you've got cached, so it can say which ones to use as parts of the new image.</p>
<p>Also if you allow approximate matches (to improve compression ratio) you risk your images being subtly doctored by the algorithm, as <a href="http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning?">Xerox did</a> a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Technically you may be able to find any bit string in the digits of pi (has this been proven? &quot;it's infinite and doesn't repeat&quot; doesn't necessarily prove it) but in general the index saying which digit the bit string starts at would take more bits than just storing the image directly.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Exactly. API docs need to be written by the developers of the API. User manuals and the like need to be written by someone with an eye for detail and require a lot more time to be spent on presentation, so are easier for a documentation manager to work on. Office procedures and the like can also probably be done by a documentation manager.</p></div>

<p>The problem is that you're purifying $Story into $clean_html, but then when you escape it, you're escaping the original $_POST['Story'] rather than escaping your purified $clean_html. So instead of this at line 86:</p>
<pre><code>$clean_html = $purifier-&gt;purify($Story);
$clean_html = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['Story']);
</code></pre>
<p>you want this:</p>
<pre><code>$Story = $purifier-&gt;purify($_POST['Story']);
$clean_html = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $Story);
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: Whoops, I got it swapped around too. Fixed now.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>So to be clear, your full code snippet looks like this?</p>
<pre><code>$config = HTMLPurifier_Config::createDefault();
$config-&gt;set('CSS.AllowedProperties', array());
$config-&gt;set('CSS.ForbiddenProperties', array('height,width'));
$config-&gt;set('HTML.Allowed', 'u,p,b,i,span[style],p,strong,em,li,ul,ol,div[align],br,a[href],hr');
$config-&gt;set('HTML.AllowedAttributes', 'a.href,src,alt');
$config-&gt;set('HTML.ForbiddenAttributes', array('style'));
$purifier = new HTMLPurifier($config);
$_POST['Story'] = $purifier-&gt;purify($_POST['Story']);
$clean_html = mysqli_real_escape_string($conn, $_POST['Story']);
$sql=&quot;INSERT INTO published (Title, pageTitle, Story, Date)
VALUES ('$Title', '$Title', '$clean_html', '$Date')&quot;;
if (!mysqli_query($conn,$sql))
    die('Crap.');
</code></pre>
<p>For starters, I'd suggest using prepared statements and bind_param() instead of inserting escaped text directly into the SQL text. Yes, it'll work but IIRC, prepared statements are more efficient.</p>
<p>Next, I'd suggest changing your code to print $_POST['Story'] directly onto the page, and (if you want to stay with your string-interpolation approach to the SQL statement) print out the SQL as well. That should let you know whether it's a problem with inserting into the database (maybe your DB user doesn't have write access?) or with the $_POST variable.</p>
<p>Lastly I don't know if there's any real reason not to do it, but writing back to $_POST feels icky. I'd suggest using a different variable to hold the scrubbed HTML.</p></div>

There's &quot;how to learn to develop software&quot;, which requires implementing a whole bunch of stuff for yourself at all levels of abstraction. The more of this you do, the better your design skills will be. Then there's &quot;how to build something quickly and robustly for your employer&quot;, which requires you to efficiently use existing libraries to build something. Usually in the second case you're making some kind of utility application that doesn't do anything particularly new or exciting, and processing speed is far less important than simply getting it running quickly.</p></div>

<p>Get a grip of the basic concepts. Programming is like mathematics, in that every step builds from the last step. Start out with simple procedural programming - there are many suitable languages, I'd suggest starting with C (if you have access to a Linux machine) or Javascript (there are <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">some great tutorials</a> that run just in your web browser), and then moving on to either C++ or .NET. Other people will suggest starting with Python, Java or similar more 'modern' languages but IMO these languages require you to understand a lot of pretty advanced concepts in order to properly know what's going on.</p>
<p>Don't put too much store in coursework. Pick a project and work on it. When you're done, think about what went well, what didn't go well. Which bits of your project are solid and reliable, which bits make you feel a bit uneasy. Go back and fix up anything that you're not happy with. Spend some time polishing your project. Then pick another project and work on that. Don't be afraid to fail - the only way to fail at programming is by giving up. The internet has an almost unlimited amount of knowledge readily available if you need it.</p>
<p>If you want project ideas, once you're past the Javascript tutorial phase I'd suggest a series of small apps and games:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Hello World': Gets you started. You'll be able to compile and run a trivial program.</li>
<li>'Guess the number from 1 to 100' text game: Gets you started with conditional statements (if/then), loops, text input and output.</li>
<li>Mandelbrot Set picture generator: Gets you started with graphics output, windowing, event handling and more looping.</li>
<li>Tetris: More advanced graphics, keyboard input, interactive real-time programming</li>
</ul>
<p>Soon you'll have project ideas popping into your head all the time. The hard bit will be choosing which ones to do!</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>This talks a great deal about offense and the right (or lack thereof) to 'not be offended'.</p>
<p>I think a far greater flaw with this code is the explicit statement that &quot;we will not tolerate discrimination based on [...] technical ability&quot;.</p>
<p>The act of developing software explicitly requires technical ability. The machine will discriminate between correct and incorrect code. Their attempt to make technical competence irrelevant to the process of software development is inherently broken, and the fact that they suggest anything of the sort shows a deep lack of connection between the authors of the code and the subject matter they attempt to address.</p></div>
