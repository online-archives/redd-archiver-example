<p>What did you use to make this programs, what sort of libraries/extensions? Also, as far as algorithms go, what's the general flow of it? Read in the input and break it into the frequency domain and use visual tools to map them to the spectrograph? Feel free to not answer (or keep things simplified without detail) to protect your IP. </p>
<p>Finally, what's next for your project? Music transcription directly to music writing software like Sibelius or whatever composition programs people are using nowadays to make musical arrangements? Or are you looking to enter that space for yourself? </p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/629878#3050795">Codes of Conduct - The Final Software Fuckery</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>To be fair though, some people on that thread were agreeing with you but wanted you to present your argument better: </p>
<p>&quot;The author needs to learn how to make a cogent argument. I expected to read an opinion piece on why codifying the conduct expected and required of persons involved in a software project is detrimental to its progress or some other aspect of it. What I found was a diatribe. It revealed more about the author than the subject being discussed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Use the story of Awesome-Django as an example of how unhelpful and political some very loud people are. Don't indulge in childish representation/demonization... We're adults who engineer and design things. We're more mature than any &quot;gamer&quot;-like stereotype. And we don't need to make political statements to prove that we need to be controlled.&quot;</p>
<p>Reading through the article, I agree wholeheartedly with your content but that first comment did nail it. What would these codes do? What examples have we seen in the past that broke down projects over politics? I mean, screw the downvote brigade there but you came off a bit defensive. The above two posts were constructive criticism.</p>
<p>Also, lol at the guy in your article's comments saying removing Linus as a contributer from Linux in the 90s would've been a good thing. </p></div>
