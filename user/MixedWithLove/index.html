Just like how there are SJW attacking aunt jemima and uncle bens rice most are not black. Most complaining not dating trans is transphobic are not trans, most of them acknowledge the difference between gender and sex and sexual preference and dont care if some rando wont date them. How about instead of attacking them becuase people defend them you just stop attacking them and they wont have a need to lash back? You know stop poking the cornered animal?</div>

"Hey we exist stop acting like we dont" and here comes you with "I dont like it so stop it! You guys are a minority so stop showing up so i dont have to deal with my fragile sexuality" 
You know what also shouldnt exist?

 Finland, they make up 0.9 percent of the population so how about we make sure they dont come up in any media or are even spoken about since the percentage is so small. We shouldn't normalize the finish since they are too small.

Paraplegics make us 1.7% of the population in the us so how about we remove joe from family guy he shouldn't be on tv since there isnt enough paraplegics in real life to justify his existence. We shouldnt have wheelchair accessible parking or stairs or elevators or bathroom since they are a minority right? Since its not normal to be a paraplegics lets just take all that shit away and keep them off tv and the media since its not normal right?</div>
