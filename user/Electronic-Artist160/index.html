    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes so true. If the MSM is going to be critical they need to be equally critical to both sides but they obviously don't and people(me included) are just blind to it.. it took me a little time to get out of this propaganda bubble, we just need the rest of the people to notice and they will it is just not going to take the same time for everyone to wake up.. i feel like 2018-2020 has opened the eyes of many people, and with this virus even more. 

We need to help speed things up somehow and try to let people see this for themselves. You can't push this on people they need to do some "research" and see how the media and big tech censor EVERYTHING critical about the radical-left. And this will hopefully make them question their political beliefs and just see how the world is really just fake. This happened for me,, i vot this scare in me like "wow im rooting the bad team here".</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Thi is what has happened to me for the last 5 months or so, just waking up to the brainwashing. Honestly i know it's cliché saying this but it's the fucking truth i was like 95% of reddit a couple of months ago saying all the "right" things and basically an echo chamber for this propaganda and really believing all the trash CNN says and MSM in general, and if i bring this up to people who used to be like me , they turn on you SO FAST! Everyone! The same comments from everyone. People have literally been programed through the tell-a-vision. I feel like people are waking up to this, but are not willing to say so in public out of fear of being outcasted.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, it's like the public forgot what happens when left tilts to far. It's not in the memory of people. Look at Mao, Fidel, Stalin. These people instantly started murdering people who didn't play along. 


They couldn't do this today, unless they disarm us first. This could end really really bad. 

I sometimes think how everything happend in Nazi Germany at the time. How were the public okay with what was happening? They made their people hate jews(just like MSM is doing regarding Trump supporters) and AOC wanting to put his supprters on lists. I feel like those few people in WW2 that saw the evil going on and the propaganda and couldn't say or do anything out of fear(of being called a neo nazi trump supporter, or qAnon conspiracy nutcase) 
Honestly i think a lot of people are somewhat affraid to say what they believe and want.

And + with COVID19 and the tensions going on in the world, the "gestapo" censorship that's going on. 

This is not looking good. And people seem to not see what is right infront of them.</div>

It's so obvious the bias towards the left is so in the open í can't believe i didn't see this shit before. The censorship, the cancel cultural.
