    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah. I mean, assuming Jesus was a real dude and what the bible says about him is true, he was a good guy overall. A bit condescending, sure, (like with the prostitutes) but not a bad person. And Christianity is quite different than Sikhism, because Sikhism believes that people can reach their version of "salvation" in any path we choose to take, they just believe their path is the easiest/best path to take, and they make that clear in the fact that they don't proselytize or have missionaries. Christianity says quite plainly in the bible, that "No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6), so it gives them the mindset of "I'm special and these other people are below me". Maybe that's not what Jesus intended, but it's human nature to look down on others for whatever.

I know a lot about Christianity, I've tried pretty much every type of it. I eventually settled in Eastern Orthodoxy, and I even was trying to become a priest and a monk. Somewhere along the way I realized that God doesn't actually love anyone, and probably doesn't exist. It says clearly in the bible that "If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads" (Leviticus 20:13), and seeing as how I am a guy (unfortunately, because I'm also trans), and I like other guys (women too!) then that means I'm "detestable". My own mother has treated me terribly because I'm a terrible gay in her eyes. I can't even be myself around her anymore. We used to have a great relationship, but she's decided that her god is more important than her own child.

By all means, I'm happy that the younger Christians are actually starting to follow their own teachings (even tho there is still that slight condescension towards non-christians), and be more loving, kind, and accepting, just like Jesus would have wanted. Christianity still leaves a bad taste in my mouth whenever I think about it tho. I stopped being a Christian, because what the bible says and what my life was did not mesh. Ever since then, after a period of depression for my entire life's meaning changing, I've been a much happier, kind person, and I actually like myself now. I can't see how it's a good religion by making me feel all the shit that it did. 

Anyway, this has gotten really long, sorry for that.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, that's about it really. Abrahamic religions all stem from a source of extreme xenophobia, which naturally fosters an "us vs them" attitude towards the world. Kill them or convert them. Thankfully young Christians are changing for the better. Also hey, we have the same religion I believe haha. Was wondering why your username sounded familiar.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Judaism teaches fairly extreme xenophobia, for one. Look at what has been happening with Palestine since Jerusalem was given to them. Not saying all, or even most jews are bad people, that'd be ridiculous.

Christianity teaches all kinds of bigotry, and a good number of people make it violent. Homophobia, transphobia, you name it. I've had to deal with a lot of this in my life, and in fact when I was younger and a very staunch believer in "Christ", I used to be an incredibly hateful person, and hurt many people all in the name of "God". I've been hurt by people calling themselves Christians, and seen friends hurt by people calling themselves Christians. Again, not saying all or even most Christians are assholes. Maybe I've just had a bad experience with Christianity, but everywhere I look at Christians and their religion, most of the time all I see is hate and negativity.

Any religion that teaches that you *have* to be a part of a select group of people to be "saved" or whatever, is going to spawn that kind of attitude. The us vs them attitude. Look at Sikhism for example. They don't believe at all that you need to be a Sikh. They don't care what your religion or lack-thereof is, they just believe their religion to be the best path. The same goes for Buddhism. </div>
