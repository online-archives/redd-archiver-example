    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Democracy is a problem because its tyranny of the majority and has lead to an increase in crimes such as prostitution, theft, property damage, etc which Hans Hermann Hoppe discussed in his book, Democracy: The God That Failed. Many even argue that Democracy inherently conflicts with private property and this is another reason for why Democracy is an issue. 

Imo, because I believe in Geolibertarianism as well as Winstanley's Agrarian Communism, Democracy IS the authority of the majority and contributes to many issues by society. Many wars, such as World War 1 and 2 as well as modern wars like Afghanistan and Iraq have all been fought in the name of God and Democracy. 

Ontop of the issues already mentioned, Democracy has always ended up reverting back to a dictatorship and why? Because even Plato came to this conclusion in The Republic. He states, “the ideal state is rarely achieved in reality and often deteriorates, transitioning from the rule of soldiers and lovers of honor, to Democracy, and then to Tyranny. This progression reflects a continuous cycle of struggle, moving from the best form of government to the worst.”</div>

>In that same period when the Democratic Party was composed of conservative, white, rural, Southern, racist, Christian fundamentalists. 

For one, looking at politics of the past today, the Soviet Union could literally have been argued to turn conservative by the mid-80s and early 90s when theh fell. Conservatives exist in every government and in any system dude because "conserving" IS in the name.

You do realize that even if Lincoln -- a Republican -- freed the slaves that doesn't make him a liberal LOL -- he still considered slaves to be inferior to the white man and that's why he didn't take it a step further and gave them rights nor did he want race mixing.

>This is also why Republicans are the ones flying Confederate flags and whining about those loser confederate monuments being toppled.

So you support history being erased? Lets say in worst case scenario a nuclear war happens or somehow all the history books are burned. How else do you expect people to learn of the country's past if everything relating to that history is toppled? Makes literally no sense and this is why society is becoming even more ignorant each and every day. Thank you.

>It’s a shame that you cowards can’t even own your history. But it really shows everyone exactly how wretched you people are, that you have to deny your own ancestors. Just absolutely pathetic stuff.

It isn't just *my* history though dude, you literally were born in the U.S. so as a nation we collectively and inherently share that history. Also, what cowards? Im here owning up and admitting to you right now that my ancestors used to own slaves and I don't condone it at all. If you wanna call me a racist or fascist for my ancestors, you are putting their mistakes onto me and that's generally unacceptable. I do deny my own ancestors, I reject them even but apparently even when I do the right thing im apparently "wretched" to people like you.

I want the statues and monuments up so that people can be reminded of our horrible past and if you want to be the one to topple them then you are the one who can't handle our nation's dark history.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You do realize the Democrats were literally formed from the Southern "Dixie" crats right? The ones who lead The Confederacy? Its been a hundred years, dude. Shit changes and most of those changes are made only to get easy votes. Are you honestly telling me that the Democrats didn't change from their racist descendants just to play on society's issues by promising free healthcare and education? Politicians are manipulative and will play on society's issues... this is a no-brainer.

The reason why backwoods redneck conservatives fly the confederate battle flag or naval jack is mainly for a sense of pride dude, soldiers died on both sides and each side was preserving or conserving their way of life. The civil war was fought between brothers. If you don't honor the fallen, I wouldn't expect you to show respect to the current armed forces who fight in unjust wars to this day -- who come back home and get attacked by groups like Antifa or BLM or ACAB or any other groups that actively oppose the status quo which the Democrats actively encourage.

If any conservative flies the confederate battle flag for ill-intent, then they are probably the kind of backwoods redneck that don't even trust or like the government so to label them as Republican supporters is just kinda ignorant and stupid. Do you really think that all self-described "Republican" supporters actually trust the government? I think you're confusing them all with the democrats who like to milk the government for welfare. It's just really ignorant to say all conservatives secretly fly a confederate battle flag when noone is looking. I'd honestly much rather stare at a battle flag than a fucking rainbow flag -- ill tell you that right now -- and if I wanted to look at a rainbow then I'd wait for the fucking rain.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That is untrue, currently the government is in control of by Democrats, even in the Congress. There is hardly any Conservative Republicans in any of the seats. 

Responding to your previous comments, if you think Trump or Obama was bad, maybe y'all should look up how Biden upgraded those "kids in cages" to "kids in internment camps" along the border.

I don't really enjoy picking a side, but the shit the democrats do are borderline fascistic.</div>

A liberal is closer to being a centrist, they put money above all but believe they should be the ones in control because they are the "third way" -- would recommend you research third wayists.</div>
