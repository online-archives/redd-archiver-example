    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh, do you have one more thought for you. There are certain words that will get you completely banned from Reddit. You post a lot of things about hip Hop, there's a word they often use to refer to each other that under no circumstances can you use on Reddit. Give it a try see what happens. It is also available offense to use a derogatory term to refer to somebody's sexual orientation. Give that a try and see how fast you get banned not just from the subway that you're on by the moderators, but by Reddit the administrators. There are multiple court rulings but social media sites can enforce their own speech codes and conduct requirements it has absolutely nothing to do with the Constitution of the United States which only governs your relationship with the government not private corporations. Better yet if you think you have free speech why don't you go tell your boss exactly what you think of him, just make sure you packed up any personal items you have because you're going to be fired and escorted off the property and guess what it ain't a free speech issue the Constitution will not protect you. I think that may even apply if your boss and you both work for the federal government. You haven't attacked the government you have attacked him personally. Also your remarks in the post that you refuse to edit with issue solved could be seen as defamatory by the company in question but you could be sued. You really ought to educate yourself about what free speech is and is not.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It isn't a free speech issue because this is not a government-run website it is owned by a private corporation. I don't think you understand how Reddit works. The vast majority of subreddits were created by users, they are moderated by users, these users are all volunteers. It's not a free speech issue you need to educate yourself on exactly what free speech is. Call the American civil liberties Union, I'm sure there will be happy to send you a pamphlet that will explain freedom of speech. Your refusal to alter your post after it was pointed out to you that your issue was solved is like  crying fire in a crowded theater, it's not only not free speech it's unethical and generally illegal. Apparently are a spoiled child who has never had to deal with the real world.</div>
