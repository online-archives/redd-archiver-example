"I am pro vax and mask, and completely believe it's a serious disease.

Censorship is pathetic and disgusting, and always backfires. I'd love to say more about how I actually feel about this post but it'd probably be deleted.

You power hungry mods have destroyed reddit by the inhibition of open discourse. People in echo chambers are far more dangerous than people allowed to have discussions with those that have better information.

You think this will stop them? It will make almost every one of them double down.

If you actually want to stop the misinformation and fight covid, go talk to them. It's not easy, and that's why you'd rather wield your inevitably damaging power trips, but it's the way to actually fix this.

You battle misinformation with information, not censorship. If you do otherwise, at some point the power will be abused when it really matters, as it already has on this site concerning any number of issues, not the least being politics."</div>

*Good god is it so hard to make an honest headline???? Jfc....this is SCIENCE. NOT FUCKING NATIONAL ENQUIRER.

The study says nothing about verification of communication, they simply isolated some genetic sequences.

That's awesome! And they totally could be using them to communicate, but THIS DOES NOT SHOW THAT.

MODS - are you even professional scientists? Do you even care about truth and the scientific method?

This sub is disgusting and pathetic. Every other post is complete bullshit in a time when we desperately need actual evidence and data driven science.

Do something good mods, feel good about yourself - fix up this trash sub to be a beacon of real science and rigorous academic research. Not a freaking tabloid.

Ok rant over. Jesus you guys suck.


Edit: Does anyone know the names of the mods for r/science? I want to tag them because I just went through the posts up and it is a God. Damned. Travesty. We could actually have something pure and good, like real science, but instead we have consumerist, political, and vested interest propaganda - THAT DOESN'T EVEN USE VALID MODELS OR DATA.

IF ANYONE IS AN ACTUAL SCIENTIST PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. Disgusting.
