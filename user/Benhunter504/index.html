    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I agree with that. Trump isn't perfect, but I do think he is the man we need right now. There is a lot of corruption in D.C. and I think Trump is to loud (for lack of a better term) to put up with that. He is a businessman, and as a businessman he likes efficiency. He sees the stuff going on in D.C. and is trying to fix it, he might be going about it the right way all the time, but he's trying, and he is getting stuff done. I read somewhere that with his most recent medical reforms the price of EpiPens have dropped 99% from $700 to $7, and that he has done similar things for insulin and other necessary everyday medications.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So on r/rant the OP posted a rant calling for an armed  military coup against the duly elected of the United States.

I looked through his responses to earlier comments, found his reasons for this call to arms and responded with an 11 point reply explaining why he was factually wrong.

*Note: I am a conservative that likes Trump, (please don't ban me, lol)

I then got a notice a couple hours later telling me I was permanently banned for violating the community rules....

I checked my post and the rules and could find no explanation as to why I was banned beyond possibly "No White People Shit" which seems rather discriminatory against roughly 60% of the US population, but how do they know I am white, do they think only White People are conservatives.

The message informing me I was banned informed me, I could respond to the post and inquire as to why. So I responded with "Please explain why I was banned? I presented the facts, to a person who was calling for a military rebellion against the elected President of the United States."

They muted me for 3 days without explanation.

Now, I am on the Autistic Spectrum, so I am a god on remaining focused. So as soon as I was no longer muted, I modmailed r/rant, explaining the situation.

 I then responded to the message informing me I was banned and muted with the message you can see in the picture above.

Well they revealed their reddit handle so I checked out their profile to find out that they are a Marxist and a Lawyer.

Just in case anyone is unaware Maxism is the school of thought that leads to socialist and communist economic systems. Socialist and Communist Regimes are responsible for over +180 million deaths in the 20th century by the way +20 million from the National Socialist Goverment of Germany (the Nazis), between 20 and +61 million Deaths in the USSR, 82 Million in Communist China, another +13 million in other Asia Communist Nations, another 3 million in other European Nations, 10 million in Africa, and about a Million in the Western Hemisphere. So you know a really great system of government. (Note the previous sentence was sarcastic) 

Another fun fact Marxist Governments are by far the most oppressive on freedom of speech, which this Mod is doing by constantly muting me.

Oh well the Jokes on them, my Austism means I will keep jumping on every three days to message them, until they either give up or a Socialist Government is installed in the US and lock me up for "hate speech."</div>
