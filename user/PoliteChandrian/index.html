I don't know what little world you live in but apparently it's one where everyone else should create a bubble around you and only allow what you want in. A safe space if you will. 

Also great point, mind your business. If you're not lgbtq+ and you don't like to engage with that sort of thing then why even worry about it? It's such a small portion of the population, right? Then why obsess over it? Why do you think Fox News and all the alternative news networks are all focused in on lgbtq+ people?

They can't. It's not reality. They would have to create their own entire little world to live in. You're asking for the same, "I don't like reality get it out of my face." How about you grow up and get over it, not everything is about you.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're right, you don't. You don't even understand the definitions you use. You might be the most illiterate person I've encountered on this sub. No only do you copy and paste entries from the dictionary without reading them you also reply to comments without reading them. At least I'm assuming so because the amount of cognitive dissonance it would take to engage in a conversation that way would require your brain to be literal sludge. 

I don't have hope for you becoming a better person. The hate you display is proven to come from fear. Fear is proven to come from a lack of understanding.  The only way to learn is to read and you've proven thats not an ability you posses. While I rehabilitation over incarceration is a core belief of mine, I also belive some people aren't worth the time. You would be in that category. Even if someone were to sit down with you and teach you letters and then words and eventually sentences I don't know if you would ever make it to the point of being able to both read and comprehend entire paragraphs at a time. Part of me is sorry for you but a larger part of me is just relieved your terminally online so no one will ever hear the hate you spew from the amalgamation you might refer to as your facial orfice.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's all people talk about but that's a very very small portion of their lives. Lgbtq members aren't going around all day trying to sleep with everyone they come across. They go to work, cook, clean, engage in hobbies and are active in their communities like everyone else. It's reductive to only consider them by their sexual orientation. Furthermore, as you just said the ONLY difference is who they kiss at home, so why care?

I brought up grooming because you used the phrase proselytize which implies the same thing. They are being conditioned or convinced into being gay or trans. 

As far as the education goes, I'd say 100 years ago to teach basic sex education(ie the birds and the bees) or pregnancy prevention would be abhorrent in public schools. Parents would be enraged and pull their kids out, threaten teachers and school board members, burn and ban books they were scared of their children reading. However, today we know better right? Now we know that as our society and understanding of human culture evolves so does our education systems. 

Also who is making it political? The kids who are just learning about it and have no idea about politics? The lgbtq+ community who isn't looking for power or even equality but rather just representation? Is the political aspect coming from the people trying to convince you these people are both weak and scary? That they are coming for your kids and trying to bring down society around you when in reality they don't give a shit about you or your kids. 

As far as representation goes in the media it's hard to understand how important it is when you're the one who is always represented. When they take a Norwegian character and make him black, that same level of frustration or aggravation you feel as an adult; some little black boy sees that and feels the same level of pride, hope. If as a grown man you can't handle a miniscule level of frustration that could fundamentally change a child's perspective for the better than you're just not a good human being. What a small part of your life to get upset about when it could be major to a child. Everything we do should be for future generations and this is a sacrifice you can make without actually losing anything. 

Btw there were a large number of North Africans as far as Norway even before the Reign of the vikings. The idea that none of their stories or legends had black/brown people in them is fundamentally incorrect.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I think a lot the misunderstanding comes from what people think being lgbtq+ is. Their entire lives aren't sexual. Like do you walk around constantly thinking and talking about sex? Because you shouldn't be around children no matter your sexual orientation if that's the case. 

As far as the grooming goes let me ask you a question, did all of the years and years of only straight people being in the media stop people from being gay and Trans? If not, then why would a few gay and Trans people being in books and tv/movies make straight kids gay? The cognitive dissonance you have to engage in to think this way is why it's so easy for the media to decide what you'll be upset about next.</div>

They might own several companies that provide the same service each such as Volkswagen owning Bentley, Bugatti, Audi, Lamborghini etc... At the end of the day we didn't defeat the monopolies during Roosevelt's presidency, we changed laws and legalized them. Now they own everything, including the lobbies that direct our government. Including the media companies that we get our information from. Fox is the largest media corporation in the world and their viewers 100% believe that what they're watching isn't the, "mainstream," news.</div>

Last time I had "normal conversation" about politics with a conservative he put a hole through his own coffee table. The time before that the guy wanted to step outside and fight me despite him being more than 30 years my elder. There's a pattern here if you aren't following. The pattern is that conservatives are fragile and when you point out obvious holes in their rhetoric their brains can't process the idea of being wrong so they have an emotional outburst. 

I live in a predominantly conservative county and I work in a garage. I talk to a lot of conservatives. I'm just as not as stupid as you are. Like no matter what happens in our conversation you're still getting censored you dumb fuck. It's kind of great.

"we Scots were a bloodthirsty race then"

So yeah not really dependant on the color of your skin considering how wide of a range of complexions are within each race. 

The Black race is different from the white race because of ancestral knowledge. Black Americans have very little knowledge of their ancestry thanks to the way they got to the US. So its very rare to be able to say, "I'm Nigerian or Zimbabwean." Especially considering the countries around back then had vastly different borders and names.

However most "white" Americans can identify nearly exactly the percentage of what nationalities they are. Those nationalities are your culture. White has no culture because it was made up. The concept of whiteness came about before the country was even established as a way to distinguish between punishments for Natives, Slaves, and Settlers. Can you guess which of those three groups represent white? "Neither shall, at any time, whip a christian white servant naked...to whip a christian white servant naked, without such order, the person so offending, shall forfeit and pay for the same, forty shillings sterling to the party injured."

https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-concerning-servants-and-slaves-1705/

They used "white" as a substitute for power. As more immigrants came to America, the "White" Christian men were getting outnumbered. Aka losing power. So what do they do? Irish are white now. Then Civil rights movements happen. Lose more power? Italians are white now. BLM in 2020? Hispanics are white now.

Black culture has developed not just in what I describe to fill a void in culture. It exists today because of a shared experience. No fair skinned European, even those descendants of slaves have a similar shared experience. Slavery in America was unique in that it was race based. No matter what if you were Black in America you were a slave. No other society has ever done what we did in the way of slavery, not even the Roman's slavery was based on race.</div>

The fact that you have to find arbitrary arguments like: he's allowed to have a gun or whether it was legal for him to purchase it. Shows just how much you actually care about the facts rather ~~rather~~ *than your opinion of the people he shot. Then putting words in my mouth to make your argument valid when that's not my position at all. 2 people are dead and he is at fault. Whether you like it or not is irrelevant; it's reality.

Your problem is that you don't see unarmed citizens on public property being shot to death as a crime unless they had the same political ideals. 

Luckily I'm not a lawyer who has to convince you and you're not a judge whose opinion matters.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;At the first location, Rittenhouse was pursued by a group, a gunshot was fired into the air by a third party, and Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum lunged at Rittenhouse and attempted to take his rifle. Rittenhouse then fired four times at Rosenbaum, who died shortly afterwards.


&gt;West Allis resident Gaige Grosskreutz then approached Rittenhouse while holding a handgun, and Rittenhouse shot him once, severing his bicep.


&gt;Rittenhouse was arrested and charged with multiple counts of homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm, and another teen was arrested and charged with unlawfully supplying Rittenhouse's rifle.


&gt;Kevin Mathewson announced the formation of a militia group he called the Kenosha Guard. On August 25, he put out a call on Facebook for "patriots willing to take up arms and defend" Kenosha, which received a heavy online response.[23] Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian and County Sheriff David Beth expressed their disapproval of armed civilians patrolling the streets


&gt;Sheriff Beth later said that ahead of Tuesday night's protests, a group of armed individuals had asked him to deputize them so they could patrol the city of Kenosha, which he refused. He said he did not know if Rittenhouse had been part of the group, but the possibility of an incident occurring was why he had refused the request.

(I do not believe Rittenhouse was part of this group I'm mentioning this so you know the city and state did not want people like Rittenhouse armed and patrolling their city.)


&gt;According to his attorneys, after Rittenhouse had heard about a local business owner who wanted help defending his car dealership, he and his friend Dominick David Black "armed themselves with rifles" and went to that business.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">He didn't work there. He had seen online the owner was looking for help defending the business and he and his friend Dominick armed themselves and just went. Unless you have some secret private source that no one else even in media has then that gun was definitely illegal. The guy who sold it to him was arrested as well. The first guy he killed was unarmed and trying to disarm him after he fired in panic. He shot the guy four times. Does that seem reasonable to you? If he had stayed his trigger-finger-happy-ass at home 2 people would still be alive and another uninjured. Other people were armed yet Kyle wasn't shot or shot at. Probably because he was the aggressor.</div>

He was running around lying about his expertise claiming he was an EMT. Then goes somewhere he knows is confrontational with an illegal and loaded rifle and you expect me to think he didn't want confrontation? He literally said people are getting injured and his job is to defend the business. Literally putting profit over actual lives. Then the police made him leave that dealership because of his behavior. Then at another location he hears gunshots and panics like the snowflake he is and fires his gun. Then when people feel they are in danger and need to defend themselves this guy is a hero? Your brain is fried on Fox and Sinclair.</div>

In reference to the George Floyd's protests: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_and_controversies_during_the_George_Floyd_protests

&gt; ...an estimated 93%–96.3% of demonstrations were peaceful and nondestructive, involving no injuries or no property damage. However, police made arrests in about 5% of protest events (deploying chemical irritants in 2.5% of events); 3.7% of protest events were associated with property damage or vandalism (including damages by persons not involved in the actual demonstration)

&gt; Clashes and other forms of violence were at various times initiated by protestors, by counterprotestors, and by police, and were usually driven by opportunistic criminals rather than organized extremist groups.

&gt;Deaths: 19 Arrests: 17,000+

People aren't going to stop standing up for their rights because there's a couple of idiots mixing into the crowd. Looting/rioting/vigilantism isn't a policy its a side effect of a system that doesn't take care of ALL of its citizens. It's YOUR right as an American to peacefully assemble. Why would you want to take that away from yourself? If it's gone for them/me it's gone for you too.

Stop bringing up unrelated issues to dilute my point. I'm talking about Alex Jones not shady Facebook groups.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;This is just an awful argument from every angle. 

You take things that happened in the past, analyze them and that will help you determine how to move forward. That's literally how all analysis works. Whether it's science, math, history or politics. 

In the case of America we have a long standing history of not persecuting white people who kill black people. Say whatever you want, that's reality. 

&gt; ...America is only 245 years old... 

Exactly. Even when we formed a new country with a constitution that gave individual rights; we still avoided giving those same rights to black and brown Americans as long as we could.

&gt; ...you can't just pretend you have any idea what would've happened on an alternate time line....

Neither can you. At least my assumption goes along with what's historically, culturally, and politically consistent.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unarmed_African_Americans_killed_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States

Look on the right most column. What you'll find is a correlation between nationwide protests and whether or not the officers were convicted or even charged.

I'm a hydrohomie, no kool-aid over here.</div>

This is proved by the last 400 years of police brutality within our country. 

The first case being in 1619, before the pilgrims even got here.

Also Chauvin will be in jail for less time than a number of people doing more time for non-violent drug charges. 

I don't condone murder so I'm not sure why you would bring up something like this as if I approve. I don't believe death sentences should be allowed in any capacity. Not sure where you're getting acceptable cost from to put it in quotes but those are your words not mine.

Looting is not the same as protesting and George Floyd's family didn't engage in looting. I know because I literally work for George Floyd's cousin. 

Bad policy? Protesting isn't policy, it's a right stated within the constitution.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Laws are the rules by which our society works.

Yes

&gt;These are the rules we all agreed to.

Well that's not how laws work in the US. Most laws are written signed and put into action without a majority of the population being aware of it. Like changing copyright laws within the first stimulus package. Yeah everyone voted for it because we needed the money and the infrastructure but they didn't discuss the copyright changes in public. Most people still don't know. Even then the public didn't vote on it, the house and senate then congress did. 

Also no making him feel uncomfortable wasn't justice. That was admittedly childish but damn I wish I was there to act like a kid too. Justice would be him losing his job and being thrown in jail.

He literally told his followers- 
1. To use UV light directly on their skin to kill germs.
2. To inject bleach into their bodies to kill off Corona.
3. To use hydroxychloroquine as a vaccine.
4. Claiming vaccines and other medicine will harm you while passing off his own psuedo-science cures for profit.

Yes, they didn't have to listen to him and I'm glad you don't have people like this in Germany. However in the US if you encourage people to engage in actions leading directly to their death that's called Manslaughter. Many people have been prosecuted for this and is not a new concept. 

False information will always be an issue and I think the only way to even attempt to sow it up is accountability. That doesn't mean lock up every dumbass with a bad opinion. However, if you're making a profit off putting people in danger, that's different.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Wait, wait, are you talking about the "scientific knowledge" on NoNewNormal? There's no way you have a degree in anything not offered by a 2 year community college. If you even have one.

I am most definitely not saying that scientific knowledge that contradicts my narrative should be censored. I said false information should be allowed, false information that leads to endangering lives and leads to death should be censored. As a matter of fact I believe very strongly that science changes over time and just because we previously thought something was fact; i.e. CDC recommending not having to wear masks at the start of Covid to the CDC changing their mind and wanting everyone to wear masks. Comes from a place of acquiring new knowledge and understanding and evolving around the new conclusion. 

The best part is you're speaking in assumptions and false determinations because I have not argued with any direct source of information from NoNewNormal all I have said is that they're alt-right and their beliefs lead to deaths and endangering lives. 

If you want to have a discussion on specific articles and sources of information bring them up.

You got so far off track I forgot what this was originally about. Your Pearl Harbor comment. By you not replying to that part of the comment I'll take that as an apology and acknowledgement you were wrong for making that comparison.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; So, I am a scientist.

My 8 year old cousin started a conversation with those same exact words on Sunday.

All the qualifications in the world don't mean jack shit if you're still wrong. If you think having all those qualifications means you can't be wrong you're extra fucked.

&gt;I'm comparing one attack to another attack.

No shit. They are just wildly disproportionate to compare to each other and beyond that historically inappropriate. Especially considering one was an attack lead by fascists while the other was an attack on fascists. 

&gt;And you seem to feel you are able to appropriately what would be scientifically intolerable. 

Well considering what goes on in the one sub I know you're active in; neither are you. As a matter of fact I would say the primary thing that would qualify a censorship of speech is someone spreading beliefs that lead directly to endangering lives of not just followers but those near to them. 

You don't know what qualifications or experience I have dealing with these issues and I damn sure don't feel the need to anonymously stroke my own ego, as you do. You just decide you're better so I'm not worth discussing with? Sounds like a Crowder retreat to me.</div>

Well I checked all your comment on this post and you're right. I must've mis-remembered from reading another thread on this post.

I oppose censorship for the most part. There's a fallacy called the tolerance fallacy which basically states if you are blanket tolerant of everything the intolerant will take over. 

How would you feel if the leaders of ISIS were able to go on Instagram live and broadcast their extremist beliefs and executions. Or Osama Bin Laden had been able to Tweat propaganda from his caves? 

There has to be some exceptions and you can't tell me you don't believe in at least one.

And here you are comparing getting shadow banned from r/aww to sailors getting bombed in Pearl Harbor? That's an exception to me. Do you have any respect for our military at all?</div>

Now that's out of the way, this is exactly my point of anti-semites hiding behind the guise of anti-Israeli. Your point is mute when your realize that there are Jewish people all over the world with zero affiliation with Israel. Israel's actions don't reflect all Jewish people opinions or morals. 

You might not realize it yet but you're proving my church and state "argument." Israel is a great example of what happens when those two aren't separated, I'm sure we can agree it's bad. 

Also I googled this for you...

Calling the actions of Israel the actions of Jews allows people to call it anti-semitism. This prevents real critique of the government under a guise that it's hate speech. It also has an inverse effect of allowing anti-semites to spew hate speech under the guise of government criticism. 

This is why a separation of Church and State is necessary.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No because you can use actual math to prove the earth is round. Statistics is different because although you're using math you have to be careful about your sampling. There's many different methods which I don't feel like going through. The point remains, if your sampling method is biased so will your results be. 

Unfortunately there's not a good way to measure crime rates right now. The only way to measure crime is by what is reported. And certain places have a system in place (like NYPD) called COMPStat that literally encourages police cheifs to lie about crime rates in their precinct under threat of their job. If you need to bump your numbers up then you make more stops in certain areas. Probably predominantly minority neighborhoods(ie:black and or muslim). Back in '17 NYC had to pay out a 75 million dollar lawsuit against NYPD for over 900,000 unlawful criminal summonses. Not even arrests, just summonses. 

Career criminal? I've never been charged with a crime so I'm pretty confused by this. Have the police harassed me and arrested me under false pretenses based purely on where I live and having(admittedly) shitty friends? Definitely. Career criminal? Definitely  not. As a matter of fact I work as a teacher's assistant for special needs kids while I finish my degree. 

Which has granted me the patience to educate commenters like yourself.

Edit: I've never been convicted with a crime*</div>

Nearly all low level crimes have come down in consistency since Mosby started this process a year ago. He's literally making shit up and you're eating it by the plateful. Do you also agree with the incoherent statistics in the post? The unlabeled chart and the articles are thrown together to make it seem as though they have a relation to each other when they don't.

The worst part is a lot of cities tried this and while Baltimore did really well in terms of bringing not just low-level, but also violent crimes down. Dozens of other cities tried the same and homicides and shootings rose in many of them. If mrstickup actually had infinitely more knowledge than me maybe he would've used a better example.</div>

Anecdotal stories that are at opposition with known statistics that are consistent across the country; doesn't really have anything too meaningful behind it. Even if your story is accurate (witness statements are notoriously innacurrate and you don't need a semester in a criminalogy course to know that) or even remotely true it's a shitty representation of the situation in our country. 

I could give you my own stories about actually going through the system. Tell you how many times I've been arrested vs how many times I was actually charged with something. Take that into account with my conviction rate and it starts to look a lot like harassment.

However my experience is my experience and I don't pretend it represents the majority. I stick with facts and so far all the stats you've provided are seriously biased. I've just been calling them out as such.</div>
