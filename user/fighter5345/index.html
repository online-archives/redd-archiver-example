I have said it before that politicians are using gun control as a bandaid that is going on a layer of bandaids that are covering a festering wound. Putting the gun control bandaid isn't going to fix the root problem and we as communities need to find and stitch close the wound so we can solve the problem.</div>

However the U-Haul do not have a good level of anti theft features a normal car would have and are easy to steal.

Last I checked you don't need to show a license to steal something though.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">These "sensible" policies you speak of are VERY broad to the degree of not being sensible in some cases.

Yes, don't needlessly brandish a firearm.

I would agree with urban areas as the population density and property damages makes recreational shooting problematic, but rural areas should have no need to restrict backyard recreational shooting as long as the bullets stay in your property and close neighbors don't mind the noise.

Yes, everyone is responsible for every bullet they fire, I don't understand about the "unless your a cop" part as they too need to be responsible for every bullet they fire so they don't strike a innocent person or their fellow officers.

Yes, don't shoot someone unless you believe your life or way or living is threatened. I still don't understand about the "unless your a cop" as there doesn't seem to be much of a change for that except for adding innocent life to it to be something like "...unless your life or way of life, or an innocents life or way of life..."</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Nice link, would be better if they weren't constantly linking to themselves or other articles which themselves were linking to other news publications that then linked to other articles with no ends to the sources. They also seem to have a couple sources which didn't even link to anything other than a "trust me bro, I heard it from these guys somewhere". They also pointed to a couple databases that when gone through shows the opposite of their claims, and also cherry picked data from other articles that didn't support their narrative. If I wrote that little piece there and handed it in as a school paper I would of probably failed.

Also the NRA isn't the big boogyman the "gun control advocates" thinks they are in that article. There were an absolute ton of accusations against them with no good evidence, and that's disregarding that the NRA is doing next to nothing to support gun rights as a whole.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Gun control is more of a bandaid that goes on top of another bandaid that is sitting on top of another bandaid, and eventually on a festering wound that has gotten infected long ago. No amount of gun control is going to fix the problem as even if guns are outright banned it's just going to move to knives, then bats and hammers, pipes and planks, so on and so forth until even words are banned because they hurt people's feeling... Oh wait, that's already happening. The only thing gun control really does is disarm the law abiding citizens as criminals and the systems that facilitate the criminals continue to cause mayhem because as massive surprise CRIMINALS DON'T FOLLOW LAWS.

Instead of asking to remove the smell of the infected wound (gun violence) with more bandages we instead ask why there is a wound to begin with and work to actually stitch it up so it doesn't get worse with bigger problems.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Personally I would also add influence from media like news reporting on these tragedies constantly and also the reclassification as well the the very broad definition of a mass shooting adding to the skyrocketing numbers. Like the past events of when news stations actively reported on suicides which lead to even more suicides back in 2000, who's to say with massive media coverage on these shootings that they aren't creating copycats who want to have their names released and become infamous or inspire people for ways to "get back" at the people who wronged them. Those mass shooting numbers are also very scary since the classification of what is a mass shooting can go by two different definitions, one from the FBI which is just any person who is actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people a populated area. You know, like gang violence in the cities. Or the definition that the media uses when it can of mass killings of 3 more more fatalities in a single incident. The latter which was put in place by the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 and used by everyone who created the skewed shooting numbers, because why is it that the media reports shootings like an hourly occurrence but when one actually happens they stick to the story for at least a week?</div>
