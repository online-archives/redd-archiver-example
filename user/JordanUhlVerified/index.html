    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Thanks for the sources. I think you are saying smarts doesn't matter because both sides can be correct.

I tend to focus on the worst outliers when I refer to the liberals, tho I know at the end of the day we are still the greatest country and full of the greatest people.

Just so frustrating to see his misinformation you are talking about. Makes my blood boil to see people riot over trump. They need to listen for a bit and not be so rash.

Honestly I do believe many politicians want our downfall. The only path to global leaders and global power is with our downfall. Once you have all the money and power in America that is the only next place to go.

Maybe I'm a nut but I believe high ranking officials on both sides want this downfall to consolidate control. That's why it's so great that a guy who sells hotel rooms and shit won. Fuck em both. Michele could have run in 2024 if Hilary was in for 8 and it would have been 48 years of bush Clinton Obama presidents. That is fucking insane. We need to reset a bit.

The politicians don't represent their constituents like they should. None of the biggest names got there by just being good people.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Thanks man. I know there are plenty of old liberals out there. Non sjw types.  

The reason I give such a high number is because in the Tristate where I grew up 100 to 200 k is middle class. For example in Florida where I livenow a 200k job is 400k equivenelt in New Jersey. So I can't ever save up down here and move back home. The scales are a bit broken is all I'm saying. My 15 year experience managers pull in the same as my brothers starting salary up there.

Trump is just himself man. He's no buffoon. Buffoons don't make it to the White House. Bush was thought of the same way. They are both authentic. I even see Obama as more of a buffoon. Sure he can talk well but his policies are egotistical bullshit. All he did was healthcare and drone strike. Both premiums and body counts are up way to much for me to consider him smart. He's a smiling face and reads off a TelePrompter. I see that as worse than a guy who says what's on his mind.

We gave Obama a chance. Maybe not a fair one but we didn't fight. I think trump is a pawn. He knows little about politics and how info is used to destroy, instead of money. Both sides should be using him to get things we all agree need work fixed, instead of arguing over the extreme things we disagree on.

I hate how he presidency has become four years to shove your shit through the houses. The GOP has trump by the balls a bit, his only ally even tho he hates half of them. If the dems and media worked with him a bit I bet we would get more accomplished. They are forcing him to a corner and to choose a side. We all are doing the same, and no one wants to be neutral.

Thanks for the response and best of luck.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">oh yea man. im still on cloud 9. i love the fact that he won and will remember it forever. im glad i get a bit of representation now, and know i might never again. i am prolly the definition of white privileged in most peoples eyes. parents did well made a cpl mil. took a risk started their own account firm. 2 person team, occasionally some help. still i am armenian and my great grandparents lose their land, home, families, and were forced to leave the country during the turkish genocide. other side is the poorest of irish immigrants.  im white privlidge, but that shit is not free. that shit was 100 years of saving every penny, something i still do. invest every cent. its just who i am and i cant be faulted for it, i try my best.

there already is an uprising man. i can see the kids burning down their campus. burning down pipelines. spamming news and media. i believe it, i can see it. its just not being fought with ar-15s.

and no i dont feel bad when town halls are canceled. especially when a bunch of loud mouth idiots gather and go to a meeting in mass and shout shit. that is now how debates are won (well maybe trump won some that way) but not locally. you need a spokesperson, a plan, and a well constructed criticism and solution. i see websites posting telephone numbers to call representatives. thats the worst. if someone actually has enough motivation to do that they can find the number. these websites just encourage botting and people with no clue to clog a line of communication with their own representative. he doesnt want to listen because he has to deal with bullshit all day, just like anyone like me on reddit arguing with mostly bots.

its boy who cried wolf. like with flynn. if you are against every single member of trumps team and fight him at every corner, why would he listen to advice saying flynn was corruptable?

democrates alienated me along time ago my friend. when i finished my masters and the only option left was a shitty job. my starting salary is not enough to pay for my parents house property tax. its less than their insurance premium for 3 people. how am i suppose to succeed my parents when i am given an education and nothing to do with it. i attended a high school that has ranked #1 public math in science multiple times in the past decade. i know how to think. i literally lost job chances at big 4 firms to immigrants who got booted from the lottery anyways. they were cheaper, and more likely to work 80 hour weeks and not complain. how can they complain when it means their visa is gone. corporate abuse. financial systems do it too. corrupted and 2008 will repeat eventually. hire foreign slaves. manipulate the market. take avg peoples 401ks. market crash when the boomers hit retirement... not good. many like me will not be able to keep their parents housed and cared for.
 
the game is clearly rigged against me. but i am telling you far more people have it worse. but i have good ideas. i can help people , just need a chance.

i have no problem alienating most of the left. if anyone quotes anything without doing research on it i can just disregard. if you arent reading the executive orders yourself, you dont deserve to have a voice this loud. people just like to argue against things they dont understand and it is holding us all back. regresslive liberalism. where are the JFK era liberals? remember when liberals were all about the working man? the working man with 1 representative voicing their concern? now they dont work, and all the men go and voice their concerns at the same time into megaphones. dont wonder why i chose to ignore it. its just noise.

i am rooting for you man. i really am. im not interested in helping the liberals fix their problems. i want to help the needy and those around me. my town, my neighbors, my friends, my family, my party. thats my circle of control. i hope you can get involved and come up with some good plans to move your party forward. you fix your problems. ill try to fix ours. and well meet in the middle in the future hopefully. do whats best for all, but im not to sympathetic after this election. sorry. its been rough.

i really dont care about identity politics. what you want to call climate change. what you want to call terrorism (from islams, white people, nutjobs, christians, BLM, anyone). i just dont care anymore.

get good jobs to people. help the poor. rebuild schools and inner cities. fix the prison cycle. stop federal dependency for individuals and corporations. and stop burdening everyone in the 80-250k range with the bill. stop letting people abuse the handouts. the upper middle class doesnt have any more resources to pay for it. i have health insurance but dont even have the time to see a dr. nearly everyone i work with does 60 hour weeks and is in poor health. the people i audit grind 40 hour weeks for pensions in mindless gov jobs.  i just dont see how thats helping anyone. red tape creates work for white working slaves. we can do so much better.

idk i can go for days. we got lots of issues. at least we can agree on that. i think we can also agree that neither of us are bad people, but is hard to get stuff done when everyone wants to take charge. need structure and opportunity for all. less bullshit and noise.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">i mean im a born republican but my party makes me a bit sick. i see the left as far far worse tho.

donald is the wildcard, and i hope it makes both parties reform. unfortunately it seems to have made both parties try to use him to establish themselves as better and stronger without the reform.

its all a joke at this point. someone gets banned from the don and the note is 'muslim spotted'. people react and say thats racist. 

like who gives a fuck. its all fake offense and triggering online.

nothing will get better if we dont think critically, look at what has to change, and fix it. nothing will get better if we spam senators phone lines and town meetings and subreddits. 

drain the swamp is a great idea. the greatest  from his campaign imo. but it feels impossible at this point. no one is willing to concede any power or admit any fault.

i really feel like i got to get to DC. they need fresh blood. if i cant do that, i will get involved locally. i already audit my county and know the local politicians. its just so much fucking work, but anything is better than staring at bullshit on the internet all day. ya feel? we need to stop yelling and take some responsibility for our own neighborhoods and faults.</div>

i fucking love trump too. saw him at a florida rally a few months ago.

i disagree with supporters on both sides at this point. everyone has an opinion and they always overstate it. i dont need that shit. i appreciate hannity rush and tucker and that is about it. everyone else talks out their ass. 

they memed yea. but the 50 million people in the rural parts of america give 0 fucks about that. silent majority did more than memes. adults were the bulk of the vote. the youngsters getting involved just was the deciding swing to trumps favor. 

its similar to obama using fb to win. yea it helped a bunch but wasnt as significant as you give it credit imo.

when i say the war isnt over, i mean every shitlib talking point is being refuted. argued for days. thats a waste of time and man hours. people take shortcuts and try to use bots and push stuff to refute it, they think they need to go to the enemy level to win. i believe its better to ignore it and move on. ignore the noise, focus on the goals. we dont have the time or resources to waste on arguing with idiots who cannot be convinced they are wrong.

we only have 4 years dude unless good starts happening. get the tax reform out asap and make healthcare agreeable for more people. thats a good start. the economy will boom if he can nail those 2 things. worry about nothing else until you are good on those imo.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">im super pro trump. still think both sides are botting too much. here and twitter. impossible for real people to talk to each other.

gridlock. idk whos responsible for botting on either side, but the result is just gridlock and progress stops.

as a trump guy my only issue is there is there is only one t_d and 20 anti trump subs botting. doesnt seem fair. i dont really want to see either at this point. idk if the libs are in the don or people have just gone crazy (or crazy people think its ok to act crazy) but they are stooping lower and lower. constantly fighting to be at a lower level than each other with their insults. i can sort of understand, because it is kind of maddening to argue with bots all day, but things are so extreme they just post to get reactions at this point.

its fucked up. go back to work. cant help the needy if we arent working and just sit around manipulating data all day.</div>
