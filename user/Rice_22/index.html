So they are an ethnicity (ethnic group) but somehow not a "race"? What is even your definition of a "race"? And you admit that Chinese is both a nationality as well as an ethnic group, meaning all your excuses above about how you "can't be racist against Chinese people" is rubbish.

&gt;*I guess this one should be extra racist then.*

Yes, that South Park gif is racist. And no, I don't support terrorist attacks just like I don't support racists. Most terrorists are also racists/xenophobes.

&gt;*Isn't it's China communist party's fault we have a pandemic on a rise?*

Counterpoint: Chinese Americans.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Americans

&gt;***The Chinese American community comprises the largest ethnic group of Asian Americans, comprising 25.9% of the Asian American population as of 2010.***

According to the US definition of ethnic groups, "Chinese" is an ethnic group. Doesn't matter if you're not born in China or not.

So, the one trying to redefine already established terms is you. The one who wanted to claim that "you can't be racist against Chinese because Chinese isn't a race" is because you want to downplay what the OP did. And even now you claim an obvious racist is "nothing racist". Oh look, he's still being racist.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I’m glad you know what Gish Gallop means, although it would be better if you have some self-reflection to realize when you engage in it.

The main point of my argument is the OP is a bullshit spewing racist troll. You try to defend him by keep trying to redefine the meaning of common terms with your subjective opinions, claim ethnic slurs are not racist because you said so, claim “Chinese isn’t a race” because you can’t get it in your head that there are groups that stretches over both race and nationality, and keep trying to derail this into inane bullshit by trying to make this about me as a person.

Yes words have meaning, but they’re also not fixed in stone. There’s something called context. There is no additional information gained when you tried to separate xenophobic with racist in this context, they equate the same thing.

PS: The OP now claims he can’t be racist because he’s a “liberal” and “Chinese” after he got caught making shit up to slander Chinese tourists.

You are arguing inane bullshit arguments because you are stuck defending an obvious racist. You somehow claim genocide, i.e. action to destroy a group of people, is not racist, which is judging people based on their ethnic group.

The double hypocrisy is when you arbitrarily claim some groups are races and some are not (blacks &amp; whites despite them being a skin colour), and that somehow you cannot be racist against groups that are both ethnicities and nationalities (see: Indians, Chinese). Then you claim because you defined them as not-race groups then it’s okay to be racist against them.

You argue the “meaning of words” because you can not attack the main point of the arguments, you try to inject as much subjective silliness into this because you cannot provide objective information to support your position.</div>

I already noted he's a liar in my first post, when he claims he's being "falsely accused of ban evasion" while having 26 previous alts suspended by reddit admins.</div>

Oh, you’re one of *those* people. I’m going to take your logic and apply it to other ethnicities so you have a better clue what your logic leads to.

Blacks are not a race because there are Tutsi, Hutu, Twa etc. so the people behind the genocide of each side in Rwanda isn’t racist.

Jews are not a singular race because there are Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi Jews so you can’t be racist against Israeli Jews.

Calling all white people warmongering sister-fuckers or all Indians dirty rapists based on the behaviour of a non-representative tiny subset of the population is not racist because it’s “factual” (not at all).

At this point you’re desperately scrambling to defend an obvious racist. It’s not a good look, buddy.</div>

Now you are claiming to be an objective arbitrator on what is racist or not, lol.

Look, even the Japanese have defined the word as a racist ethnic slur and should not be used in polite conversation.

&gt;&gt;The entry for shina (支那) in the Kanjigen reads in part as follows: 「中国のこと。昔、中国の仏教徒が、仏典を漢訳するときに、インドでの中国の名称を音訳したもの。元来外国人が中国を呼ぶときに用いてきたもの。現代は、蔑称に近いとして使用しない。「至那」「脂那」とも書く。「震旦シンタン」ともいう。▽Ｃｈｉｎａ（英語・ドイツ語）・Ｃｈｉｎｅ（フランス語）などと同じく、語源は秦シンだといわれているが、異説もある。

&gt;&gt;Translation by Japanese speaker: "[Meaning:] China. In ancient times, when Chinese Buddhists translated the Buddhist sutras into Chinese, they used the transliteration [i.e., the transcription of the sound] of the word used in India for China. Originally, it was the word used by foreigners to refer to China. In modern times [gendai - i.e., after WWII] , it is close to being derogatory and is therefore not used."

The ROC under Chiang Kaishek also told Japan to stop using the word. The only people who still use the word in Japan today are alt-right racists like Ishihara Shintaro.

&gt;*how did you spotted him?*

When someone does the same thing over 27 times you kind of recognize his habits and posting pattern. I knew this guy since he was /u/Kannanet about 7 years ago.

But hey, here’s more evidence of his racist dog-whistling:

He's a racist ban dodger. I gave you proof he's a racist, and obviously mods in multiple subs agreed he's a ban dodger based on the evidence they have. When the reddit admins eventually get around to suspending this account next, they will have proven me correct.</div>

It was a term used by Japanese war criminals to dehumanize Chinese people back in WW2, and carries negative historical connotations the same way the word “negro” is no longer acceptable to refer to a black person. The slur is STILL used today by Japanese alt-right racists like Ishihara Shintaro when referring to Chinese or Ryukyuans. It’s also used by masked bigots in HK to dehumanize mainlanders just like the Japanese soldiers who once committed mass atrocities against HK locals.

I’m telling you that your guesses are the opposite of reality. He’s a mentally ill person who literally called for the genocide of Chinese people in one of his alts. I am an actual HKer.</div>

He's being banned for ban evasion. Having multiple accounts is the pre-condition for ban evasion.

I gave you proof of him using the equivalent of calling black people the n-word and still you claim there's no proof of him being a racist. If you have no intent to be convinced by facts or evidence and want to remain disingenuous, then just say so.

In fact, we can make a small bet on it, if you like.

&gt;*The only thing that links them is alleged anti china rethoric.*

The common link is that every single thread where he claims he's being persecuted, is actually due to him breaking subreddit rules and there's no such "Chinese censorship" involvement. In fact, you can see multiple anti-CCP threads active every day on all those subreddits he submits his content to that suffers no such censorship. He's well aware of this, because being banned for legitimate reasons then making up bullshit is also a pattern.

1 He goes to the same subs as his last 26 alts: /r/bestof, /r/worstof, /r/chinareddits, /r/subredditcancer, /r/todayilearned, /r/unpopularopinion, /r/jobs, /r/theoryofreddit, /r/pics etc.

2 He post in the same time zone as his last 26 alts.

3 His submissions are titled in the same format, complaining about being "censored" for breaking other subreddit rules:

https://np.reddit.com/r/chinareddits/comments/epz2ea/despite_evidence_to_the_contrary_rtheoryofreddit/

https://np.reddit.com/r/chinareddits/comments/avmwqf/yet_another_model_redditor_falls_victim_to/

https://removeddit.com/r/chinareddits/comments/c0hnob/banned_from_rlifeprotips_for_mentioning_taiwan/

4 On every single alt account he claims this is his only account, "but even if it isn't then it's still censorship". He has made this excuse on almost every single one of his alt accounts.

5 Whenever he gets called out, he makes link posts on other subreddits (like this one and /r/subredditcancer) about how he's being unfairly persecuted by downvote brigades/chinese shills etc.:

https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/awrzix/rchinareddits_originally_a_subreddit_for/

https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/etz58n/downvote_brigaded_in_rchinareddits_a_subreddit/

6  He makes up the same persecuted backstories: claims to be Chinese/Taiwanese/Jewish/Asian/woman, LGBT, Antifa, whatever allows him some leeway to engage in racist dog-whistling.

7 He farms karma in the same way, posting hundreds of anti-Trump articles on /r/politics, /r/worldnews for easy karma, before spreading his filth that resulted in his past 26 accounts being admin-banned. He claims that his "karma" makes him immune to being racist, and that anyone banning him from whatever sub is actually working for the Chinese government. Most of his accounts are less than a month old with 15k or more karma.</div>

They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The racists have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.” ~ paraphrased from Jean Paul-Sartre.*
