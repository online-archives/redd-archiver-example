I challenge you to cite me any established pandemic protocol or epidimeological papers claiming it's possible to eliminate a pandemic through mandatory 2 week lockdowns. It's genuinely mind boggling you beleive that, you must have swallowed some serious pseudo scientific propaganda.

Go back to the articles during that time. Even the "experts" purported it was 2 weeks to *flatten* the curve - not eliminate it.

All Aus and NZ did is keep their populations at the beginning of the viral timeline, i.e. the pandemic has barely begun in these countries. They're facing the same problem regarding covid that the rest of the world was at the the beginning of 2020 right now, just equipped with experimental vaccines, a dilemma of of when to open borders, in the wake of being ravaged by lockdowns, and with an endless cycle of more lockdowns until they finally bite the bullet and accept they have to let the virus run its course.</div>

You can't go around saying that cars are unreliable because people keep getting stranded when you pour sugar into their gas tanks. It's the fault of you and people like you that we didn't fix this problem 14 months ago.

What do you think waas the purpose of those two weeks? Do you actually think it was to eliminte the virus!?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Don't give me that two weeks bullshit over a year into this nonsense.

You want to be scientific? I'll leave you with a couple suggestions:

1. Look up the actual fatality rate for covid: infection fatality ratio (IFR). Not CFR. You can't have a rational view on covid unless you know this. 

2. Look up the average person dying of covid, specifically how old they are and how many comorbidities they have. You'll find the average age of covid death HIGHER than life expectancy for that country, making covid among the luckier ways one can die. You'll also find 2+ comorbidities. The CDC recently stated the average covid death had FOUR additional comorbidities.

3. A pandemic is nothing surprising. In 2019, it was an inevitable occurrence of the future. Thus there had been established protocols in place in pubic health (BaSed on ScIeNcE) in response to a pandemic. I suggest you find these and find where in any Western country's public health pandemic protocol were there lockdowns anywhere near in severity in which they've been implemented. 

4. In order to determine whether lockdowns harm or benefit more, we must analyse how many life expectancy years they kill vs save. Keep in mind, the life of a 25 year old is vastly more valuable than the life of an 80 year old (average covid death). If a 25 year old loses 5 years of his life in some way due to lockdowns (damaged health due to drug overdose, domestic abuse, loss of 5 years of net worth), just because that person is technically alive, you can't discount or dismiss the damage done to him. That's worse than someone already past the human life expectancy dying from covid, cancer, and diabetes.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's a separate argument.

I'm referring to this logic specifically: 

&gt; The answer is yes, if leaving your house kills people, you should be forced to stay home.

Leaving your house necessarily "kills people" via flu and car accidents. Sure, the flu typically kills less than covid, but it kills nonetheless.

So do you acknowledge this is faulty logic or do you beleive we should be forced to stay home and not drive?</div>

&gt; There was an old lady sitting down, we were inside in a restaurant. It was time for her to leave so she was trying to get up but struggling. So I went up to her and helped her up, helped her walk out and down the steps (just two) until she was on the sidewalk with her walker. 

&gt; She told me she was 87 years old as I held her hand to support her weight and slowly walk with her. I told her if we hold hands, I can't promise I won't fall in love. She laughed. By the way, we were both unmasked as well.

&gt; Reddit, AITA?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They mandated it for hospitality workers and gyms. The former doing light cardio for 10 hours a day. The latter doing intense workouts. Retail workers, although not necessarily walking around all day like hospitality workers, are still wearing it for prolonged periods of time. This shortlist isn't exhaustive; use your imagination.

I think there are cons to mask use that vary with how long it's worn for. Think about it. There's a pocket of CO2 left inside the mask with each exhale, which is then inhaled in the next breath. Your quality of air is compromised. 

Each individual should calculate the risk/reward and decide for themselves.</div>

&gt; There aren't any other choices. 

Yup, I agree and never claimed otherwise.

&gt; Ask them. Talk with the moderators of that subreddit. The subreddit didn't make the decision about whether the drug should be or shouldn't be permitted but the "quality" of the recommended treatment that would be linked to or included is probably their consideration. Not the quality of the post.

Yes, they ended up clarifying that this was previously posted and provided me the link, so gotta give credit when it's due. Their initial mistake was removing it for "low quality".</div>

If something works then you have to define a measurable goal. 

What is that for lockdowns?

&gt; But I guess if you don't trust math and science

This is a good example of arguing in bad faith. We both have opposing assertions, and we both claim scientific reasons. It's not polite to straw man, ad hominem, etc. and makes you look unintelligent.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; The curfew rule isn't arbitrary. Neither is the threat of a lockdown. These are specific things, not arbitrary. Why do you think this choice is nonsensical?

Look up arbitrary. 

&gt; Personally I've been horrified by people packing bars and house parties in a completely unreasonable response to social distancing requests.

It's okay for you to be horrified by decisions other people take in their lives in response to risk. It's not okay for you to use force to imprison them in their homes.</div>

Now any time cases go up (which is just a virus being a virus and humans being humans), even though deaths have no correlation, they lockdown. South Australia locked down hard over 17 cases.

I'm talking about people who aren't leftists having a better browsing experience. Seems futile to engage in any sort of discussion with them as they tend to engage in multiple logical fallacies, argue in bad faith, and just gang downvote against the narrative. 

Lockowns are inherently political. I highly encourage non leftists to avoid these subs! :)</div>
