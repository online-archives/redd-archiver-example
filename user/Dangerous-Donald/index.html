April, 2020

&gt;	Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed)

December, 2020

&gt;	But scientists have learned a lot this year about the coronavirus and how it's transmitted, and it turns out all that scrubbing and disinfecting might not be necessary.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/28/948936133/still-disinfecting-surfaces-it-might-not-be-worth-it

Flip flop

Scientists have been studying coronaviruses for at least 30 years. Why the flip flopping from April to December?  

They did the same with masks. 

Trust the science though. 

If you feel like you can catch Covid 19 from surfaces take precautions because they don’t know wtf they are taking about. 

You aren’t wrong to ask questions but maybe Reddit isn’t the place to do it. There’s a huge agenda here and if you do anything that is perceived as misinformation or disinformation or a conspiracy theory, whatever they feel good about calling you for daring to not believe, you’re gonna get banned. 

Good luck to you and I hope you get some peace through these trying times.</div>

THERE IS CONFLICTING INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

&gt;	Different Kinds of Surfaces
It’s unlikely to catch COVID-19 from a surface, **but the risk still exists**. Lab studies have found that the virus may last on different materials for varying amounts of time. We don’t know if these findings always apply in the real world, but we can use them as a guideline.

I find it incredibly disturbing that you would follow people around on Reddit trying to get the last word. I believe you have good intentions but you come across as someone who thinks we’re all just a bunch of morons and it’s your job to belittle us until we agree with you. 

You’re a well educated doctor who has a bunch of fancy titles and all but I didn’t see anything about you that mentions psychology and mental health issues. I know you’re a doctor and all but should you be giving mental health advice based on just a few posts in a forum?  Of course not. You are just belittling people because you think you’re better than them. It’s not a good look. 

Perhaps you should head on back to your little safe space and chat with your little followers and enjoy your little accolades. 

Us buck toothed hillbilly uneducated folks ‘round here know that science is ever changing and it’s never “settled”. We have the right to research and ask questions without feeling like we’re stupid.</div>

These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. **In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch.**

Understand we are all getting conflicting information. There’s no need to suggest therapy for someone just trying to find the truth.  This whole event has had so much conflicting information and your desire to be “right” just comes off as smug and condescending.</div>

I believe you and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s surface transferred.</div>

Even if you don’t believe everything, just listen. You will learn to filter out the nonsense from both sides and reach your own conclusions. Everything they dismiss as “bad faith” and “debunked”. 

The goal to them is always money and power and the media, politicians and lawmakers are joined at the hip. The politicians take our money to pay the media to report their facts so they can reference on FISA warrants and during impeachment proceedings.  

They take our tax money and launder it through foundations and companies where their family members and friends get contracts and sit on boards all the while enriching themselves with our hard earned money. 

This is Democrat’s and Republicans alike. Greedy and manipulative and NOT representing the people who supposedly elected them.</div>
