But what really got the ball rolling for me was Karel the robot and CodeCombat. But I did get lucky on having a good Python instructor, have me a sweet Python Shadow Run dice roller now.</p>
<p>Most of my casual coding is with Vue.js.  I've made the most progress with that language by just using Vuetify? example pages and playing around.</p></div>

Algorithms help teach how to break up large problems into small steps. That's a really helpful skill. Too many try to program too much all at once instant of one tiny part, make sure it works, then move onto the next tiny part. That way, when it comes back with errors you know exactly what part isn't working instead of hunting for hours. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>There is this one game where you program tanks to fight, reminded me of Karl the robot. Which was my first experience with Java.</p>
<p>My first and only language I was any good at was Python. Ended up building a dice roller for shadow run. I remember my brother really liked Ruby on Rails and the books Test driven development with Python, Two scoops of Django, and a few JavaScript books we've lent out and I can't remember the names. O'Reily and The Pragmatic Programmers have some great books for learning. Then there's 57 exercises for programs to help develop programing skills with any language.</p>
<p>Plus there are always things like Code Academy to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Now I'm trying to pick up JavaScript. I like it, but mostly I like learning from my brother. He has a great coding style that so SO much easier to understand than any of my college courses. Part of why I started looking at other colleges was because my instructors were making me unlearn his teaching to learn some out dated get my ass fired mess of coding.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>My first project was creating a Shadowrun dice roller for my Python class. Probably my best learning experience. </p>
<p>First, Python is a pain in the ass when it comes to graphics. But it was fun to logic out the design. Creating one dice, then a row, then multiple rows, all while keeping track of where the graphics point will be.</p>
<p>Then it helped me explore different libraries. I ended up going with Tkinter, creating buttons instead of graphics. </p>
<p>So i learned a lot from that project; breaking a complex problem into small individual parts, optimizing code so I create the element once then apply it repeatedly (do not repeat yourself), user interactivity, applying images (i remember that being a pain), and saving/loading.</p>
<p>That was the first project that I coded on daily for long periods of time, I couldn't step away from it. So the best thing I learned was to learn programming by finding a personal use/interest and trying to code it out. Really helps keep me focused and a bit of a perfectionist with it.</p>
<p>Right now I'm trying to pick up ReactJS with some Mobiscroll components, I'm pair programming on it and it's so massive of a project it's breaking my brain. Trial by fire can also be a great motivator. I'm picking up more than I did in school but I'm definitely lacking some fundamentals.</p></div>
