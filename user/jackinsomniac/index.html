    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's all I got from her definition, yep. She didn't explain it any better than that. (And yeah, if you think about too hard it's kinda insulting, like you're saying bisexual people are all whores who will sleep with literally ***anyone*** they meet)

I'm willing to say this woman in particular was probably an odd one. We ended up talking about relationship stuff for the rest of the night, I told her many times I had a girlfriend, and was underage for drinking at the time. (So this was around 2009-2012) She bought me several beers and we ended up tricking the wait staff into thinking I was 21 because of it. When we left the bar, she walked to her car, and when I walked over to my car she turns and says, "You're not coming home with me?" Like WTF, girl I told you many times I have a gf. No. Maybe her definition of "pan" is closer to swinger, which is even more ironic if you think about it too much.

Idk, it's just a kinda funny story that the first time I ever heard "pansexual", I'm pretty sure the person who claimed to be it didn't even fully understand what it meant either. I've been called an idiot many times for not understanding this stuff, but you gotta give us a break when the "correct" definitions and terminology keep changing, and the people who claim to be a thing can't even define it accurately themselves.

Abusing a legit support system just to troll/harass someone, or as a harsher way of saying "seek help" is cowardly, and also against a bunch of reddit rules.

But yeah, stand tall, all they've proven is they big mad, and couldn't even articulate a response.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">LOL, the acronym kept getting larger because they're so all-inclusive they couldn't say "Nope, we already have that" for every sub-genre of sexuality/orientation that people claimed to be. 

It became ridiculous, so others used the full acronym to mock how ridiculous it was, now they've realized it and are walking it back. They used to use it. But now they changed their mind, so what was once endorsed is now seen as "trolling".

I'm all for gay & trans rights n' shit, but every human is also entitled to a bit of mockery from others if they feel like it. This group is literally figuring things out as they go along, despite how many claim they've already got it all figured out. First person I met who claimed to be "pansexual" could only describe bisexuality to me. Her: "I'm pansexual." Me: "Oh, interesting. I've never even heard of that before!" "It means I decide if I want to sleep with a man or a woman." "Oh, ok, so... like, bisexual?" "Nope, I CHOOSE if I want to be with a man or a woman tonight. Like, I decide in the moment, it could be either." Me internally: (that's still bisexual!) If you think about it too hard, it's almost insulting. As if everybody doesn't *choose* who they want to have sex with. As if you're implying every heterosexual man will have sex with ANY woman, or a hetero woman would sleep with ANY man, as if there's no CHOICE involved at all. Especially when you use the definition of bisexual and just add "choice" to it. Over the years as I thought about this, the trans & non-binary stuff became way more popular, and I started seeing 'pansexual' more often. So I kinda decided, "Maybe pan should mean you'll have sex with those people too?" And if I'm not mistaken, that's kinda the socially accepted definition now, right? Bi- (binary) means man or woman, pan- should be all inclusive, right?</div>

HERE HERE!! 

There's so much rhetoric going around that you can't trust the other side, you can't even talk to the other side, they *ALL* believe X,Y,Z (horrible things) and you shouldn't even bother.

Any instance where I've been able to break through that, or find someone simply willing to to hear you out, it always turns out that we have a lot more in common on even hot button issues than we're led to believe. People are primed to be distrustful of the other party, it's stupid and it sucks, we can do better.</div>
