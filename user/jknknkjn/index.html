    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Your "whoever kills a soul is as if they killed all humanity" doesn't mater if the religion doesn't believe it applies to non Muslims. 

That phrase alone doesn't justify killing Jews by Muslims, it only shows that Muslims pray that their god will kill Jews for them.  Correct. But when you put it in the context of 'fight for me against all who transgress/disbelieve in allah' it's quite easy to see how it's used to justify killing Jews.  Either way Islam is not a religion of peace to non Muslims and has **absolutely no place** in a world that would allow religious freedom as it's very core doctrine teaches that it is unacceptable to not be Muslim. Oppression is a core principle of islam.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No I don't but when I hear about a fight in a club by a group of people who believe their god will anhilate the people the fought against and that their religion awaits their death and they believe even the bar and the disco ball would call out for their death if they could speak, I assume it wasn't just a couple punches if the attackers had their way. 

Edit: you're being  ingenuous if you're claiming that it's only about verbal fights or fistfights. The Quran explicitly calls for beheading and cutting off fingertips.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm not devoting too much time to this charade. That's why I quoted those two, there's no way to justify them as being peaceful. 

As to your question: if those two are as negative as they seem and are the only ones (they're not) the other 99.9% doesn't matter because these call for the total destruction of non Muslims which means it's a religion of violence to all who don't obey so who gives a shit what the rest says?  Nobody who believes in religious freedom.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You literally have dying in a hell fire a pass because "other religions do it too". That's not how you prove something doesn't exist that's how you give it a pass.  Oh and you don't understand Judaism if you think it has hellfire. Judaism doesn't even have a hell. 

You also have he destroying of Jews and Christians a pass because 'god doesn't make mistakes like human judges do'. 

Then you tried to argue that it's only self defense which isn't true. 
&gt;
Quran (2:191-193) - "And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)" (Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior to this (190) refers to "fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you" **leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families.  The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries.  In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did).  Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's rule (ie. Muslim conquest).**  The use of the word "persecution" by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution (idtihad) - and oppression are not used instead of fitna.  Fitna can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation.  A strict translation is 'sedition,' meaning rebellion against authority (the authority being Allah).  This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned "until religion is for Allah" - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief.  [Editor's note: these notes have been modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language. Verse 193 plainly says that 'fighting' is sanctioned even if the fitna 'ceases'.  This is about religious order, not real persecution.]</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm going to comment again on this main comment for visibility because while you may be right about his quotes coming from the Hadith,
Your larger point about (3) not being able to quote negativity from the Quran is laughable and your opinion about rocks and trees calling for the death of Jews not being negative is insane. 

Here's a quote directly from the Quran, NOT the Hadith. 


[Verse 2:191](https://quran.com/2/191-201)

&gt;**And kill them wherever you overtake them** and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.

[Verse 9:30](https://quran.com/9/30-40)

'May allah destroy Jews and Christians'

&gt;The Jews say, "Ezra is the son of Allah "; and the Christians say, "The Messiah is the son of Allah ." That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. **May Allah destroy them**; how are they deluded?</div>

It's not like the mod knows that those quotes are not from the Quran anyway.

https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx

There's some negative verses from the Quran. Like killing Jews and Christians or that allah will destroy them for not being Muslim.  Or that not believing, in general, warrants your death.   

It did take me a whole 5 seconds to find that website and then another 10 to search the verses on Quran.com</div>
