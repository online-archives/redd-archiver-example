    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I just watched it with my girlfriend, and we both think it's really great. There's a lot going on, which I'll try to summarize.

First off - the 'sexualized imagery'. This is obviously high on everyone's minds. There's so much to say, and it is challenging to isolate this away from the context of the rest of the movie, but I'll do my best to address how the imagery looked and felt in the context of this criticism. It felt horrifying. Mostly it felt awkward and perhaps a little deranged to be experiencing it. This is of course entirely intentional. A huge theme of the movie is that young girls are participating in adult culture in ways they don't entirely understand. The lewd acts are meant to highlight two things specifically - our own discomfort with the imagery, and this problem I mentioned of how young *people* absorb sexual imagery in the world around them, often without guidance from trusted adults to help them interpret those messages and find a safe middle point between prudish conservatism and the sort of libertine exhibitionism portrayed by pop music and social media.

Something that I came to appreciate throughout the film is that the negative reaction to it is itself a huge problem. People see a still image of 11 year old girls and their reaction is - *cover them up, some sick pedophile is getting off on this*. Think about that statement in the context of a modern societal viewpoint that women can dress however they want, and it does not give anyone the right to make assumptions about what that woman wants. Wearing a mini skirt does not mean a woman deserves to be sexually assaulted. And the possibility of a man reacting to a woman wearing a bikini top does not mean a woman shouldn't be allowed to wear a bikini top. By complaining about these images of 11 year old girls being in provocative situations, YOU ARE SEXUALIZING THEM. It is not the girls who are uncomfortable. It is you. The argument that some pedophile will get off on it is meaningless, there is endless smut in existence, and this tiny drop in the bucket could never be construed as some sort of tacit approval of pedophilia. To suggest it is absurd and extremely sexist. None of this is to say that the girls should be acting the way that they are. In the movie they're clearly acting out and lacking guidance and the movie is VERY CLEARLY NOT ENCOURAGING that girls act this way. But at the same time, the girls are just being girls. They're just kids struggling to find their way from childhood to adulthood. Some of them have periods, and in their cultures, that means 'they're a woman now'. 

This brings me to what this movie really is - it's a coming of age story. Yes, you and me both are uncomfortable with a coming of age story about 11 year old girls. That doesn't mean it's unreasonable. There's lot of movies about 11 year old boys doing dumb dumb dumb things to get the attention of girls, and often half naked. But this is a story about making mistakes and learning and growing and struggling to find a place in the world.
Let's make some comparisons regarding male coming of age stories. I'll start young. In Ender's game - he is 6 years old having a brutal, bloody, naked fight in a bathroom against of bunch of other boys.

The Sandlot - middle school boys go to the pool and scheme to kiss the lifeguard, shirts off, one of them actually sexually assaults the lifeguard by pretending to drown...

Good Boys (2019) - 12 year old boys spend the movie trying to get to a party where they can make out with girls in a basement with no parents around.  A major plot point throughout the movie is a SEX DOLL that the boys interact with.

tl;dr - sexualized imagery is not the problem with our society. The problem is people refusing to see women as people with the same freedom as men.</div>
