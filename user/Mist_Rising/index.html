    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>The religious figures were pretty evil and the gods were just manipulative aliens. 

One religious figure, Kai Wynn, is evil. A few of the priests occasionally do bad things, but the other major characters including Vedek Beryll, Sisko, and Opaka are very much good. 

The prophets themselves are manipulative (so is everyone), but I don't think they're manipulating as shown as evil. Just very blue and orange morality. They don't see things as we do, just as the Bajoransx vulcans, Tellerite, etc aren't exactly human morality.

I also don't think "striving for a utopia" is exactly a standard for proving leftist writing. It's just to..broad.

I will grant they tackled racism, and famously PTSD. I don't think that makes them leftist though. Just human.</div>

You can do whatever the fuck you want in your plot of land so long as you don't piss off the big honcho. And the big honcho says basically anything goes so long as it doesn't hurt the head honcho.

The user has no power, their little peasants in the system.</div>

Unless your an anarchist, capitalist or otherwise, government does exist and the definition of small is pretty loose. Presumably the government would provide security for the collective agreement.</div>

He definitely ticks the racist (CRT or whatever) box off, He called African people monkeys in the UN while talking to Nixon. He was almost certainly not a fan of LGBT.  He created the abortion angle himself when he allied with Christian evangelicals.

He definitely loved his big business and no regulations motto. Also low taxes, high spending, that's all him baby.

The current China/Russia situation is backwards to what he said but that's the cold war era. Presumably he'd shift on that if it meant winning.</div>
