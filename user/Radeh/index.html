I'm Swiss and when I was born, people were ranting about Italians...who integrated well. Then Turks...who also integrated. As I got older, a lot of people ranted about people from Jugoslavia and Kosovo. Or people from Africa. But if I go to the shop back home now, the chap's name at the cashier might be Dragan Pavlovic...not exactly the most Swiss name. But they speak Swiss German/French and had a way to integrate (good school system), in many cases even if they were too old for regular school. Stuff like free language classes or education in general. If you don't offer them a way to catch up quickly and get decent jobs, things are bound to fail. It's how you create ghettos and closed communities. 

This happens even quicker if the local population treats them a bit like outcasts or a "danger". 

So yeah, more focus on integration policies are needed...</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm just trying to use a long term approach to the whole ME mess. 

Islam has already started going through a reformation...but at different speeds depending on country. If you grow up in a country with a ruthless dictator and censorship to the point where you can't develop a different viewpoint than your nut job leaders...reformation will take ages or is impossible. One example of that is our amazing ally Saudi Arabia. Where did the majority of 9/11 highjackers come from? ;)

If you live in a Muslim country with more open leadership and less censorship, reformation happens quicker. 

So if our goal is to make that reformation happen quicker, building walls or lumping together the majority of innocent &amp; harmless Muslims with the crazy ones isn't productive. Propping up dictatorships won't help either...Saudi Arabia, case and point. 

What will help is encouraging relationships and openness. That's how you support the majority of harmless people. It won't stop the crazy ones, but it will totally rob the crazy ones of all support from local governments or the public. 

Christianity went through this. Judaism did too. In countries with those religions, people generally had less censorship and good access to information...so reformation could happen. If someone tells you evolution is a hoax in the US, you can go online and look it up on Wikipedia or watch a Youtube video. In some ME countries, stuff like that is blocked or people simply have no way to get that info.

But if you grow up in such conditions, you shouldn't be grouped together with terrorists if you haven't done anything wrong. The only winners are groups like ISIS if we do that. If we tell those innocent people they are dangerous, where do you think they'll run to...ISIS. 

To ensure everyone looks at fundamentalist idiots like we look at WBC, we have to break down barriers and have open dialogues. The whole "OMFG Muslims are dangerous" approach is nothing but a great recruitment tool for ISIS :/</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; The people that disagree are there fighting. the people that want it as it is, i would assume, are not fighting. You'll notice that some country's rebellions are larger than others. 

It's not just a matter of whether people want to make a stand or not...a lot depends on how powerful those dictatorships are. 

In KSA you don't see any revolt at all because they have an iron grip on everyone. There are a ton of beheadings for anyone even speaking up too openly. If they don't like you, they just charge you with witchcraft and you die. 

They're also incredibly wealthy and (thanks to US support) well armed. Not sure if you've been there, but if you had you'd know the average citizen would stand no chance fighting the current regime. It would be like a caveman fighting an aircraft carrier. Look at how ruthlessly KSA operates in Yemen against civilians. 

Or Syria for example...look at how hard it is to overthrow a damn dictator who's ruthless. 

Plenty of people disagree with the regime and fundamentalism (there are several "I want out" threads on Reddit), but also realise the odds stacked against them.

Sadly in today's world it's not just a numbers game, military tech plays a huge role as does foreign intervention. KSA's regime is propped up by the US for example...so if someone makes a stand against the regime, that regime will brand them as terrorists and the US will go along with it. 

It's easy to argue for revolution while sitting on a sofa reading Reddit...</div>

The problem isn't just Islam, it's how intertwined it is with dictatorships and how they are using it as a tool to stay in power.

Do you understand the difference between changing a post and making a new post? :D

And again, comical how you don't understand why the majority of attacks happen in warzones...and those are located mostly in Muslim countries right now. Your conclusion that this somehow allows racist cunts to group all Muslims together is both laughable and sad at the same time. Also makes it clear you don't really understand geopolitics ;)</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are totally ignoring the fact that most attacks happen in warzones...and the majority of those are in Muslim countries. So if you use logic just once, you should realise that's the reason. 

In the west, only a tiny minority of attacks are done by Muslims...because they aren't Muslim countries suffering from wars.

Do you understand why the majority of attacks in Muslim countries suffering from wars are committed by Muslims...or do I need to do an ELI5 version for you? 

Also, google Christian terrorism to find lists of attacks...they are more common than you think ;)</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm saying it depends on which country you talk about. If you talk about terrorism in Muslim majority countries, it's obvious that the majority will be Muslim. 

In the US, most terrorists are Christian...because the majority religion is Christianity. Doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to understand why this is.

And again, speaking out against doctrine in many Muslim countries can get you killed...so if someone interviews you and asks about some fundamentalist aspect, guess what the answer will be given a "bad" answer could get you killed.</div>

We have crazy people in the US too who want to introduce the death penalty for gays. 

You can't just make a statement saying Islam is bad in general when the majority of Muslims aren't an issue. Fundamentalism is the issue here...and sadly many Muslims don't exactly have a choice about voicing their opinion openly in that regard, unless they want to be beheaded.

The majority of victims from Muslim terrorists are actually other Muslims...which again shows they aren't representative of the wider Muslim community.

Not an apologist, but someone who cares about logic and facts. Try it! Your attitude plays right into the hands of ISIS, congrats ;)</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; maybe they're mistaking the fact that the faith allows and encourages the behavior for "all muslims are terrorists"? 

It doesn't...only a perverse interpretation does, just like all the WBC bullshit. Just like most Christians, most Muslims don't follow the fundamentalist interpretation. 

As for Sharia, there are a lot of different interpretations. 

Lastly, one thing we mustn't forget is the political climate in a lot of Muslim countries. They are often dictatorships where the leadership has struck a deal with fundamentalist religious leaders (Saudi is a great example of this)...which means the general population can't make a stand against what they say without risking death. 

It's easy for us to say "why don't they protest" sitting on a cushy sofa here in the West...not so much for them. Even speaking out against doctrine online can get you in serious trouble...just look at how many bloggers have been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for example. 

There are millions of Muslims living in total peace in the West without causing any issues. Hell, if you look at the number of terrorism attacks in the US, you realise the majority aren't done by Muslims. 

The easiest argument proving why it's retarded to claim they are all a problem is that there are almost 2bn Muslims. If they really all were to blame or an issue, we'd be fucked. Also, I'd be dead...because I'm a 6ft blonde atheist who spent weeks in Saudi Arabia during Ramadan for work. I'm super open about being an atheist (yes, even in KSA), yet somehow I'm still alive and had many great dinners/lunches/parties with Muslims over there. 

The poll you linked isn't all that helpful. If you asked most Christians if the story of Noah is true they'd say yes...doesn't mean they're all insane enough to really believe this ;)

My main reason for being ok with censoring racists idiots isn't that I care about letting them speak...I have that view because their stupid uneducated ramblings are actually helping ISIS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNJLkIkYQM
