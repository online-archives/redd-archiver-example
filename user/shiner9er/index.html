We have a lot of work to do before this problem is put to rest, though, i still dont know how to think of going about doing it. Integration is one problem that comes to mind with immigration, especially when we're talking about a scale like this, and we cant very well just walk in and give them education without a ton of problems arising. I guess we all just keep spitballing until something sticks</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">i completely agree, yet what about integration? Is whats happening in europe not a clash of fundamental world views? what i mean by "happening in europe" is the rape rate in sweeden, germany, and the uk skyrocketing, unemployed masses of refugees in Sweden, not skilled enough to fill the positions available, etc. Like do we just throw money at them, try to re-educate them, and hope it works? for children, it WILL work. But im not so positive thinking when it comes to the adults. people are super stubborn everywhere.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There comes a line of "i will die fighting for this", and its reserved for the most serious of things. for example: i will die fighting for my right to freedom of speech. If tomorrow, north korea took over america, and instilled the same laws they have over there, i, and an extreme amount of others in my life, would not stand for it. We would fight until we either won, or were dead. If you look at something as paramount as your right to live freely as "meh, we wont be able to", you really dont care about the cause that much. There are gun runners all over the world. the citizens living in syria that want to fight ARE FIGHTING. they persisted, and the rebel forces are certainly to be reckoned with. It seems to me that your solution to increasing terror attacks is to do absolutely nothing. not even have a conversation about what could be done to prevent this in the future. Every single thing i throw at you of why this is happening, you're insisting that we can do absolutely nothing to stop it. I hate to break it to you, buddy, but while we've all been squabbling about refugees, and how many to take, poland is sitting in a big fat 0, and a count of terroist attacks that matches it perfectly. I guess thats a coincidence. I guess its also a coincidence that sweeden and the uk are getting the worst of it, and they imported more of this idea structure than anywhere. Is it coincidence, or fake news?

The bottom line is islam in its current state is incompatible with western culture. It just is. Before people are brought into a country, they need to be properly investigated of their views on western morality.
You may ask why bring refugees into the discussion, but its all linked. all of this is dependent on each other with the end result being "islam is not compatible with the ideals of western society.". The ONLY reason i say this is because of a lack of reformation. we dont need to screen christians because of the lack of people that read the old testament and say "fuck jesus, this is where its at, lets stone some gays". The new and old testament are very incompatible, and people will 99% of the time choose jesus because of the peace message. There is no jesus in islam. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, i get that. and the population of many of those countries agree. Like i said, there is rebellions in just about every one of those country's we're referring to. The people that disagree are there fighting. the people that want it as it is, i would assume, are not fighting. You'll notice that some country's rebellions are larger than others. take my logic and apply it to that. Obviously, more people in that country want to live free from that sort of thing, than in a comparable country with a smaller rebellion. Thats how my brain would process that, anyways.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're correct in the assertion that its geopolitically related, but you have yet to touch on the point i'm adamant about. While Christianity has the same horrible things as Islam embedded in it, Islam has had no reformation. When you have something has antiquated as these two idea structures, and nothing changes, you end up with people thinking some antiquated things, like its okay, encouraged, and actually holy to kill gay people and adulterers. 
You're obviously more educated on the matter. I can admit a lesser understanding when its apparent. But what ive been saying is that, for example, ISIS, is not "perverting an interpretation", theyre doing things that are word for word in the book. If the KKK was running around doing this shit, i would be saying the same thing. but they arent. and i think its partly because of, here comes to special word of the day, reformation. Even the WBBC wont kill people, because in their words: "we are the watchers. we have been instructed by jesus to love our neighbor, and we love through saving.". There is no Jesus in islam, there is Muhammad, a man that conquered, enslaved, raped, and pillaged his way to the top of the middle eastern "food chain".

So in short, im not going to disagree with anything you said, however, im going to add my point in as a caveat to your conclusion, unless you would like to extrapolate further on the idealogical front.</div>

The links and statistics are just to show that there IS a problem. my suggestion of solution is in line with what some imams are now saying, in that, islam is in desperate need of a "PR makeover". in a religion, thats a reformation. If the majority of people dont agree with the horrible things in the book, why not make an "addendum" (IE. New testament) to correct it?

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">and when 80% of the population supports the church and the state being intertwined? christianity has had its reformation. thats why you hear people say "oh thats the old testament, not the new testament". faulty logic, but it sure did stop the crusades. Even imams are calling for reformation, and some jihadi sympathizers online are like "nuh uh! the muslims can never have an issue! we're so flawed and theyre so above us".
If the question was "does the christian idea structure allow for x" bible verses ABSOLUTELY would be relevant. we're talking about what the quran encourages, and the large amount of people that are fine with adhearing to it. You are the most non-sequiter loving person i've ever met. Follow the idea to the finish. The original point that i made. was. There is a problem with islam and violence. it is encouraged in the quran. it is ALSO encouraged in the bible, yet the bible had J Chreezy die on the cross and teach peace. the new testament wasnt added until far later. Christianity. has had. reformation. islam. has not had. reformation. the rate. of violence. in islam. is higher. what. is the difference. between. these two? reformation. without ANYTHING else. please explain to me why islam does not need a reformation.</div>

here, does this help?
THE ACTIONS OF TERRORISTS DO NOT REFLECT ON THE 2.1BILLION MUSLIMS IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND FEELINGS.
There. is that better? now can we get back to the point that islam has had no reformation, and thats the problem here?</div>

-is shown that over half of the muslim majority world is in support of violent ideas.

-brings up christian terror, that happens at a rate of about 8% of islamic terror

-trivializes 8 terror attacks in the span of 1 month

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">yes, 8 attacks in the span of a little over a month in Britain. i guess britain is a warzone. ALL OF THESE attacks were associated with islam because of the perpetrator praising islam, praising allah, etc.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism#United_States
no, theyre about exactly as common as i would think. 1 maybe 2 every 2 or 3 years. thats not even comparable to the amount of islamic terror we've experienced in the west. (western society, not just america)

So your logic still isnt adding up, bud. Sorry, but this isnt really something ill be changed on. Islam needs reformation, or the war that isis so desperately wants between the west, and islam, is going to happen.</div>

When you do that, i'll name you 10 islamic terrorists in the past year. Im not speaking of just the US, im speaking of the entire world. so whats happening in britain? the majority religion is christianity, yet islamic attacks are beginning to be a monthly event.
and to your effect of saying "speaking out against the doctrine can get you killed", i agree. BUT. what about country's like malaysia where sharia is not the legal system, yet polling shows that 86% of muslims are in support of it being the legal system. Your logic isnt adding up, my dude.</div>

Equating a small minority of fundamentalists wanting death to gays to the vast majority supporting executions for gays, and actually executing gays, is one of the stupidest things ive ever heard. And you're saying exactly what im saying. FUNDAMENTALISTS. the people taking the book literally, word for word. you cant just say "fundamentalists are the issue" and then think there isnt a problem with islam. If the fundamentals are that abhorant, why is that not a problem?

Im not saying there arent christian terrorists, but to say theyre as frequent or widespread of that of islam is just a bananas statement. you would have to have your pants on your head to even begin to believe that.

Saying Islam is bad in general is completely different from saying there are serious problems with the islamic idea structure. I cant even believe i have to explain this.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">"its retarded to claim they are all a problem"

when i clearly said thats not what im saying. What cant you understand about criticisms of an idea structure are not aimed at the people that follow that idea structure? Its absolutely ridiculous to me that i cant criticize an obviously superfluously flawed idealogy without someone saying "duh christians doe". christians arent killing others and themselves in the name of their religion. If they were, and i could find dozens of scriptures to back up that behavior, i would be saying the exact same thing about christianity. it doesnt reflect on the people that follow the idealogy, it reflects on the people that take those specific ideas seriously. The fact that you muddy the water by bringing in a false equivalence of "did noahs ark happen" and "is it okay to stone gay people" is absolutely mind blowing to me. a better question to christians would be: Do you think the raping and pillaging of cities in the name of god was right? if they answer yes, im goign to look at them the same as someone that would support sharia.
The fact that everyone cant just take a stand against the bad ideas in the worlds largest idea structure is just abhorant to me. Not all muslims of course, not even muslims in general, but YES. ISLAM.

EDIT: since you're inevitably going to come back with more "preverse interpretation" claims, http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Themes/jihad_passages.html, there are 164 full verses, in context, in the quran that are associated with jihad. yes, some are "spiritual, inner-self" jihad, but tell me how many of them justify/encourage inflicting harm on others in the name of Allah. Again, yes, its in the bible as well, but we dont see this with the bible, because theres more "casual christians" than casual muslims. Those muslims that you speak of, the peaceful, well-meaning people, are the same as those christians who cherry pick the bible for the nice fluffly parts. Nothing wrong with them.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">maybe they're mistaking the fact that the faith allows and encourages the behavior for "all muslims are terrorists"? The bible tells people to stone gays, but you dont see people stoning gays. The opinion of sharia law in muslim majority country's is 55% according to pew research. That means that 55% of the people in muslim majority country's support sharia being the standardized law. Sharia, if dont know, is the law set that allows people to preform honor killings, throw gays off of roofs, throw acid on adulterers, etc. My theorizing for the reason this is a problem with islam and not with christianity, is that followers of islam have more conviction when it comes to their religion. more of them are willing to follow their book word for word over christians following their book word for word.

Dont get me wrong, the terror aspect is a seperate issue, but they stem from the same problem. Islam is imcompatible with western values in its current state. We need islam 2.0, or it needs to die off.

EDIT: i realize i didnt post the link for the pew research, my bad. http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/ (sharia numbers are about 1/16th down the page)</div>
