He was only interested in free speech to the degree to which it agreed with him that "blacks and women shouldn't be allowed to vote." (Yeah, the shithead actually said that.) He banned tons of people for "being cucks." Fuck that guy. 

I knew it would only be a matter of time before he gave reddit enough rope to hang the sub. If someone less of a total fucking zealot had started the sub, it might still be around. But let's not pretend he's an innocent victim. The guy was a pile. </div>

Reddit only cares about their advertisers, but the mods have been given the delusion that they're locked in a "noble struggle against Nazis."

Their only struggle is with reality, which won't hit them until they leave home.</div>

We're talking about scumbag college kids who know FUCK ALL about the world, who are actively trying to silence free speech wherever their feelings get hurt. 

And make no mistake, reddit has actually become an important platform for speech, political or otherwise, and reddit's totalitarian tactics to sanitize this site for advertisers will have a PROFOUND impact on public discourse. 

Shame on fucking reddit. </div>

Confident people, secure in their beliefs, have thick enough skin to withstand even the worst opinions of others. We never try to silence others to make ourselves feel better. Free speech is intended to protect the worst speech. Benign speech needs no protection. 

And I know reddit is a private company, but that doesn't mean they should be allowed to comfortably stand in opposition to free speech. It's un-American at the very least. They're not even trying to protect people's feelings; they're trying to protect their advertising revenue streams, which is even worse. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Hate is an opinion. Reddit isn't merely censoring calls to violence (which are *exceedingly* rare in my long experience). Reddit admins and mods routinely delete REAMS of opinions, every day, which are deemed 'offensive' along arbitrary and shifting lines. With no explanation. They simply get deleted.

It's an entirely False Dilemma to say that Reddit wouldn't exist if they censored opinions. They do so thousands of times every day.</div>
