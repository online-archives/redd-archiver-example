    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">First of all, your citation had nothing to do with the comment chain. You simply posted it to post it. Any mod would see that for what it was.

Secondly, I would like to know your level of education and/or qualifications. Because based on your reading of this paper and what you've quoted, you display no skill in critically reading scholarly articles/studies.

Thirdly, the quote you picked is completely cherrypicked from the larger abstract. I suspect you saw this somewhere and are just reposting it, but whoever originally posted it just cherrypicked the information.

Because as the ABSTRACT says:

&gt;The vast majority of people killed by police are armed at the time of their fatal encounter, and more thantwo-thirds possess a gun.

&gt;African Americans are disproportionately killed by police officers nationwide.

&gt;The disproportionate killing of African Americans by police officers does not appear to be driven by micro-level racism. Rather, it is likely driven by a combination of macro-level public policies that target minority populations and meso-level policies and practices of police forces.

&gt;Fundamental macro-level policy changes, as well as changes to meso-level organizational practices, arenecessary to address the root causes of racial disparities in police killings

---

So right there, these authors are saying that blacks are disproportionately killed.

In the study they also go on to say that it's not as much individual bias, but structural, institutional racism. I will remind you the lead author here, Charles E. Menifield himself, is a black male. So while he might have a bias on the micro, you cannot impugn him.

He notes:

Until 2013, the federal government failed to even properly count killings, so his study begins in 2014 and goes to 2015. This is responsible. Because any data from before the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 would not be valid.

They note right away that numerous studies have shown *anyway* that blacks are disproportionately killed.

They make the point that the "bad apple" theory (the micro) is wrong, because even POC officers are killing blacks, which is a macro problem as it is systemic and institutionalised. 

They cited a study that diversity had no impact on reducing police violence. That it's institutional.

Look...I'm gonna skip ahead because I'm not gonna re-write their article and if you can't be bothered to read it, you probably won't read this comment either. I'm just leaving it here for anyone who comes by and sees your full of shit.

Go to the bar graphs. 

Page 6. The top.

Whites are killed more, which no one denies and is to be expected because there are simply more of us. More whites die of cancer in the USA because there are more whites. No lying with statistics. 

It shows that blacks had DOUBLE the proportion of deaths than whites. 

That bar graph is so simple, even a child would understand it.

What you posted is completely out of context and contrary to the report.

And, in fact, I am going to email the authors myself from my academic email address just so they can lose faith in humanity at how manipulative you are.</div>

You're gonna have to sort that out in your mind, just as they will.

Anyone who commits violence to protest violence is a hypocrite. 

Aside from that, your comment makes no sense because you're decrying a peaceful form of protest. Why? To make the life hell for the people moderating that sub? It has to be intentionally incendiary. 

If you had any awareness, you'd have said "I understand how that could make your life difficult. I didn't speak well and I wanted a call to more concrete action."

There's so much subtle baiting and trolling right now and your post is either that or you misspoke and should own your mistake to the mods and stop crying to us. Man up and own your shit. Delete this post and go apologise.</div>

There's no big conspiracy.

The subreddit is a pain in the fucking ass to moderate. I was asked to do it early on and said "no thanks" because it's a terrible job. 

The people who comment there are like YouTube-level commenters and about the only thing the mods agree on is that they don't want the admins up in their shit. You saw what they did to T_D. 

I will also add that the sub and even some of the mods are more to the right than the left. Sports are competitive. They're not filled with bleeding heart liberals like myself, it's mostly people who eat their steak raw with their bayonet while listening to Sousa marches.</div>

It's called COVID-19

This isn't time for political games.

It got the name because it was discovered in 2019. Hence the "19". It has a name, has had it for awhile and it's fine as-is.

And no, we are not entertaining MERS or Spanish Flu, either because those are ignorant. So don't bother.</div>

Yes you did.

I clicked your article.

Is this the title, yes or no?

&gt;To Tame Coronavirus, Mao-Style Social Control Blankets China

What does YOUR submission title say?

What is the rule in /r/worldnews about editorialising titles?

You deserved the ban and you are being really shady by framing it about them not liking statistics. You broke the most cardinal rule of the subreddit.

Read the rules. Right there:

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/submit

The only way you can technically change a title is if the title makes no sense.

For an example: let's say NYT ran the article with "Coronavirus, oops!"

Well that would make no sense. So it would be up to you to take that and go "Coronavirus, oops! China implements social controls after the fact"

Your reply to the mods was pathetic.

Mine would have been:

"You are right. When I saw the red part about the title, I tried too hard to clean it up and lost the intent. If you unbanned me, I would never submit a title like that again."

If were the mod, I would have unbanned you for that.

Instead, you're here, complaining to us and demonstrating zero awareness or culpability for something you clearly did. You are the stereotypical person who just shoplifted going "I didn't do it" when you're holding the stolen goods.

We got no time for this. No idea why you got a 97% upvote. This submission should be removed by the mods here as well.</div>

After reading your posts here and seeing how rude, judgmental and dismissive you are, they likely assumed you had nothing kind or helpful to say to people in need.

And I get it. I don't like the pre-bans based on where you post, either. I think it's BS censorship. But if you step out of yourself and look at what you posted:

&gt;Triggered some fucking lib I’m sure

&gt;You’d think the lefties would welcome good advice so they could get jobs and out of their moms basement

I mean, it could be that you post on T_D or it could be how you talk. I mean, if I needed job advice, would I find "get outta yer mom's basement fuckin' libtard" useful?</div>
