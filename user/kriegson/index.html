Of the people Mccarthy had accused, over 90% were found guilty and were fired or "resigned". They were only accusing people within the government, not private citizens. And with evidence, as it was bore out.  

*Patton* though, should have finished the job against the commies.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It makes good sense in the right context. 

A person who's never even held a gun shouldn't be trying to lecture others on firearm safety.  

A man shouldn't be lecturing a woman on how to properly apply feminine products or to get over the cramping and discomfort of her period.  

A woman shouldn't be telling a man that getting hit in the balls isn't *that* bad.   

And a foreigner shouldn't be telling someone else how to conduct the affairs in which they are largely ignorant aside from skimming headlines in the context of something that was only pushed into law *two years ago* and is now being revoked. 

Funny how that works eh? It's almost like said people saying you don't have a place to comment might actually *know more about it*. </div>

Access to the US military is not a right. The US military does discriminate based on age, weight, height, muscle density, physical capability and considerations along with mental ones. 

if you have a record of mental issues, you can be rejected outright. Women are often not allowed on the front lines because a slew of psychological and physical considerations aside now you have to run more supplies through dangerous territories for femnine hygiene products.   

Furthermore when you join the military you *are* discriminated against fully and entirely. If you are stocky and short you will likely end up carrying heavier gear for your squad. If you are too tall you cannot become a pilot, they make the pilots to fit the aircraft not the aircraft to fit the pilot.  

So on and so forth. People who are purposely seeking to cement their *identity* are not going to be helpful in a place where identity is sacrificed for the sake of unity. You are not a man, you are not a woman, you are not black, white, latino, you are not southern, you are not northern, you are not west coast or east coast.  

You are an Airman. A marine. A Solider. A sailor. Of the Us military. Full stop, nothing else matters, certainly not your gender pronouns. </div>

Well given the president isn't Trans, Mattis isn't trans, i guess you have no place to disagree with them on the subject.

They reject western principles, values and morals. Embracing Cynicism and Criticism in hopes of finding something better but they never did. They searched for years, they built their identity around that idea there's something better, but they never found it so now they are stuck defending that identity their lives revolve around.  

When they discovered they could find nothing that mattered to them, they decided nothing matters at all, and embraced nihilism. Even if they can't build a better society, they still want to reduce this one to ash in hopes that something better grows.

TL: DR   

You know those people who reject capitalism, a system that is flawed but works, and always push for communism, a system that is *theoretically* flawless and so *never works*? No matter how many times communism fails?  

Yeah, they're those kinds of people.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Wikipedia isn't a reputable source because anyone can modify pages and it has a clear bias.  

See how that works?   

&gt;It is important whether Obama ordered a wire tap on Trump's campaign, that's what Trump claimed. I think we can both agree that the truth matters.
  
The Tap occured, people were unmasked potentially illegally, and information was leaked to the press all under Obama's administration. These are undeniable facts.   
 
&gt; I just hope to open your eyes...places like Fox News  

You'll note I didn't link fox news once. Your prejudice is showing, in fact if you looked at the article I posted regarding media bias you would see Fox news was perhaps the least biased against Trump but *still* up to 50% or higher unfavorable and biased reporting *against* him.  

The majority of MSM is owned by the same 6 or so corporations, they are products and producers, advertisements. The only place you can get relatively honest reporting is from "fringe" publications because they have no investors pulling their strings. Whether or not you can believe *everything* they say is a matter of critical thinking rather than dismissing them offhand based on "What is reputable and what is not" given that naturally corporate sponsored products such as most MSM have better advertisement to make them appear more "reputable".   

It's like comparing Mcdonalds to a local bar and grill. Mcdonalds appears reputable because it has advertisement. The bar and grill you would actually have to investigate and given that it has no reputation because it has no advertisement you would likely consider it disreputable offhand, but that's not strictly the case.    

Fox news is no different. They often sell controversy as their primary product which tends to be contrary to most outlets but they are effectively controlled opposition. Another brand of product from the same company claiming it competes with a different brand.

----------  

At any rate, we can agree on "It is important whether Obama ordered a wire tap on Trump's campaign". And you have never disputed the facts that:  

* Under Obama's administration two FISA warrants were submitted, one was rejected for being too broad in scope. His appointed FBI director accepted the second FISA warrant based on a document that was demonstrably unable to prove its claims.  

* Susan Rice who is under the direct order and chain of command of Obama requested the unmasking of individuals and information recorded during the investigation. This is not the job of the executive branch, but the judicial branch. The judicial branch (FBI, CIA) did not determine it was necessary to unmask individuals that were part of the investigation.    

* Unmasked indaviduals and data from the investigation was leaked to the press in attempts to damage Trump, his campaign and his administration.
  
These are facts. The only debate currently is whether Susan Rice was within the law to unmask indaviduals who were part of the investigation, who leaked that unmasked information to the press (Illegal) and why the investigation was created and greenlit in the first place. </div>

In which case you would have to provide evidence they are disreputable and their evidence is false.  And you're still deflecting from the main argument.     

&gt; Pretty much everything else   

Splitting hairs and once again, deflecting. You're focusing on a single very specific instance to try and disprove of all the other instances. You're not in the least bit trying to argue a point with intellectual honesty, you're just trying to be "right" rather than admit again, the obvious truths.  

* Two Fisa warrants were submitted. The first was too broad in scope and was rejected. The second was more narrow in scope and used the report that the FBI wouldn't even pay for (They offered to pay if the claims could be proven, they couldn't so they didn't pay) as evidence to allow the warrant.  

* Susan Rice who acts under direct authority of Obama requested and received unmasking of individuals recorded. Not only did the FBI and CIA deign it was not necessary to unmask the individuals in the investigation, but  it's practically unprecedented for someone in the executive branch to do so rather than the judicial. 
  
* Unmasked data of Trump and his admin was then leaked to the press.    

It's funny how you keep referring to things that have factual basis and evidence as "conspiracy theories" while likely proclaiming things like "Russian collusion!" that have no evidence of [and even your own side admits this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bqzEpRR4n8), as "fact".  

[Study demonstrates that news media of Trump was invariably biased negatively](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=ab6d830a9d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_05_19&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-ab6d830a9d-189799085).

--------  

There's no point in arguing with you any further, again you have no intention of being honest or learning anything. You'll cling to your willful ignorance and it's terribly obvious as you:  

* Deflect the points of discussion  

* Dismiss evidence without even reviewing it  

* Split hairs on points to try and find a way to be "right" on something that is irrelevant to the overall argument.   

You don't want to be right, you just want to "win".</div>

Also **deflecting** the topic to Trump has no relevance to the evidence or points presented. Again:  

There is no question Trump, his admin, and others were under surveillance at this point. Go educate yourself on the Susan Rice scandal, everyone admits it exists but argues whether or not it was legal or justified to do.   

P.S. What's especially Ironic is that the last source I used was NYT themselves proclaiming  "Wiretap data used in inquiry of Trump aids" a publication you just simutaniously said isn't credible (because I used it), and at the same time is a "respected publication" (because Trump attacks it all the time).   

-------  

That feeling you're getting when your desperately ignoring looking up Susan rice or actually looking at what my sources present? That's called cognitive dissonance, it's a form of willful ignorance where you ignore the obvious evidence presented to you and fabricate your own reality to protect your world view because it's too painful to do otherwise. </div>

The wiretaps have been a known element for at least a month now, the question is why Susan Rice unmasked people who had been tapped and then leaked that data. The FISA warrants exist, yes that is plural. The first was rejected, the second was accepted but on the grounds of a shitty supposed intelligence article that the [FBI wouldn't even pay for](http://archive.is/vAtoX) at the time as their justification of "muh russia". [Democrats have already turned to trying to defend the taps because evidently the year is 1980 and the red scare is all the rage again.](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/03/hillary-clintons-campaign-manager-robby-mook-confirms-knew-wiretaps-video/)
