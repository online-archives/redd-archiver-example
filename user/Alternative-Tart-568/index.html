Isreal has more then enough QME they are using f35 against people with firecrackers and 10 dollar ak. Nowhere in the actual treaty does it give any specific amount of aid or any specific reason for aid.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Bro you literally can only say things that are wrong again per capita the usa isn't even close and if you combine Europe as a whole. Something you should do as thier combined gdp is only 15 trillion and usa alone is 23 trillion and the fact that they are basically one country if you factor in the European union. Europe has already outpaced United states. Second our defense budget is over 700 billion annually and we are saving cash by not only giving the equipment we are replacing anyways. But we if Ukraine wins we wont have to constantly send our equipment to europe or have as big of a presence and can focus on china. Look up how much it costs the usa to send a brigade to Europe. 1.19 billion dollars that's only about 4k troops. Imagine having to send 100k troops something we have done in the past to counter Russia.</div>

Not a defense treaty. ( Mutual logistics and support agreement) that's a trade treaty not a defense treaty. ( General security of information agreement) classified information agreement not a defense treaty. (Mutual defense assistance agreement) is a mutual logistic logistics support agreement. Lol read what those things mean it would be like me pulling out ( assistance of criminal matters agreement) 1999 yes it's a treaty with Ukraine but is not a defense treaty. Lol again you have no clue what your are talking about. The only defense agreements we have with isreal are memorandums lol.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Lol we never had a treaty with the kurds. And by your argument if we support a group for years we are obligated to them? If that's your argument then we have supported Ukraine with training since the 1990s and have supported them with aid since 2014. Second the usa has all sorts of treaties outside of nato. For example Japan, South Korea, and Israel are all NOT PART OF NATO. Yet we have treaties with all of them SEPREATE from nato. By your definition United states of America doesn't have a treaty with isreal it is a memorandum (also known as a agreement) lol dude you clearly have no clue what you are talking about. The isreal treaty is literally called ( the memorandum of understanding) so we should stop aid for isreal right now and never help them in the future as it's just a 25 year old ( and vague ) memorandum.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's a dumb take. European nato countries spent over 347 billion dollars on defense last year. Russia only spent 84 billion and they are in a war. China spent 290 billion in 2022. That's not even factoring in the strategic importance of having access to military bases that allow out navy to operate anywhere in the world. And having nato navies help keep the shipping lanes free so that our economy doesn't tank overnight.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">First off I have nothing against the Kurds. I'm just stating the obvious that what you consider Kurdistan is land that is in five different countries, and that it would be impossible for the Kurds to have their own country. Second it would be a land locked country with all of its neighbors hating them with no access to trade and having to guard against every square inch of boarder. Third kurds were a ally of convenience as a minority group they were subjugated for years and second class citizens. But they are a very weak without a centralized government with lots of factions. Also Turkey a more important geopolitical ally wouldn't stand for support of a usa backed Kurdish state. ( especially because it would take Turkish land)                                                 Israel has done more then just a one off collaboration. They have stood against USA's interests on more then one occasion. What have we got back from backing Israel? Our support has actually made it more difficult to work in the middle east. It has took years of work to gain the few allies we have in the middle east and had opened the door for china and Russia. You say their are obvious benefits that we have from backing isreal. What are they?                                                                                 No while the budapest memorandum didn't specify how the usa would respond, it did promise to come to Ukraine's aid should they get attacked. You are literally spitting hairs. You can call it whatever you want but the official UN title is (Memorandum on security assurances in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) and it was a treaty that is registered with the UN lol.                                                                                          The fact that your are disinterested in supporting Ukraine, But are intrested in supporting isreal and the kurds show how inept your views are. Tell me what would be the end result for supporting the kurds be?  Is it going to be like with isreal where we have to alienate the region and basically pay them billions of dollars every year in assistance with no end insight with zero return on investment? Outside of oil something isreal doesn't have, and something Kurdistan wouldn't be able to export, because they wouldn't have access to the sea and all their neighbors would hate them so good luck with a pipeline. Not to mention most oil fields are in saudia Arabia. An ally that is shaky at best and would definitely be opposed to a Kurdish state.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Lol first off economics and geography wont allow Kurdistan to be it's own country lol you do realize that that country cant exists surrounded by countries that hate Kurds with no access to the sea? Not to mention the fact that the usa would have to invade iran, iraq, Syria, Turkey and Armenia. Well you just described a false ally if Israel is aligning with our biggest rival in china and giving them technology. The Budapest memorandum wasn't a trilateral statement lol it was a agreement on security guarantees. So your views on American geopolitics are to support a country who helps our rivals. To help a minority group who is a ally of convenience with a perceived territory that is in 5 separate countries and one of those countries is an ally. All the while ignore  a country that is actually helping us by destroying the military capability of our second biggest rival so in the future we can focus on one. We get absolutely nothing for giving Israel weapons it doesn't make America safe it's the opposite we now have to bomb Yemen and iraq. While in Ukraine they have destroyed something like half of Russian active tanks prewar.</div>

The same russia that has lied about everything lol. So you deflected and brought up the fact that some neonazis were part of the protests in order to change the subject and cast a documentary as propaganda for not including it in said documentary when the protest were about a corrupt president not nazi ideology. And even if you say you are not Republican your political ideology is on the right.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">First off the usa invaded Vietnam. As far as the middle east is concerned what's the end point of us being their? Second the stuff we gave Ukraine is old and would have sat in storage for years until we gave it away or decommissioned it. We haven't used the ods variant of bradlies for a few decades. Third we would have bought  new shit regardless the usa spends over 700 billion on the military annually. Fourth its given the usa an opportunity to get rid of the crap we bought in the 80s like Humvees and m113. Fifth Ukraine will have to pay the usa back for a majority of the stuff. Seventh how have the Democrats gutted rathion and other defense contractors? And lastly do you know how expensive it is to rotate bragadies to Europe something we do because of russia? Do you not understand the amount of logistical support rotating thousands of troops it takes. Do you realize how much money it takes to ship one 70 ton abrams? Ukraine is saving us a ton of money in the long run by destroying so much of Russian military that we the usa can allocate more resources to focus on china.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Military aged men are always treated with caution when in a war zone. Even more so in the middle east becouse of the over abundants of militants wearing civilian clothing. Regardless being careful of a population that has a governing body who's fighters typically don't wear uniform and target civilians isn't "opinion" its fact. Second you are doing the exact same thing that you are saying the poster is doing. Making assumptions based on race, location with out evidence. Just because there's videos of Israelis undressing terrorists doesn't mean that it is standard for all units.</div>
