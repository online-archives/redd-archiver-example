They had a meeting with Fauci when the genome was sequenced, and a week later (after review by Dr Fauci) it was published. The email transcripts have been published, but were redacted because the EchoHealthAlliance (Bill Gates, Peter Daszak, et al) were involved. You will also see Dr Daszak cited over and over as one of the staunchest "Natural Origin Only" mouthpieces.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">in the general/abstract, 100% agree.   
but we're talking about less than a week after the genome was sequenced, the people with the most to lose if it was lab-origin came out and said "scientific consensus" was that it was IMPOSSIBLE to be lab-origin. They dictated policy and suppressed dissent by yelling 'scientific consensus'.

It was gross, and not at all science. when i say consensus is the opposite of science, science is repeating someone else's experiment and validating their result. When it's been repeated by a lot of people, it's a reasonable assumption to make.

But if I learned one thing from "Under Siege 2: Dark Territory", it's that assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups. :)</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Fuck blogs. :)  
My area of research isn't biology, it's "wireless". Businesses (Amazon is one) pay me to analyze their problem and propose a solution. So I \*can\* write really great papers, but I can also read research and say "that's bullshit" or "that's working back from a conclusion". Look at the vaccine efficacy study that had EXACTLY 50% dispersion. That's bullshit, it just never happens...

But I only brought it up to point out that when you do real "science", you don't give any weight to "consensus" of others. During COVID, we saw a lot of unethical "scientists" who were willing to cash in their credibility to get published and get in line for some grant $$.   
The 'scientific consensus'  couldn't exist a week after the genome was sequenced, but that's what was stated and anyone who said "seems suspect" was called a science-denier, CTard, etc.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I have a MSEE and a BS Physics, I was an engineer on the first 5G device ever made. I was also an engineer on Waymo's autonomous driving research, did validation engineering on Oculous2,  and fixed the design of the Axon police body cam. But LoL at your "i'm a PhD".  
People with meaningful PhDs, in an actual science, will generally state their PhD focus when claiming their PhD. That's because a PhD in Electromagnetics means fuck-all to someone with a PhD in Organic Chemistry. You can claim whatever PhD you want now, we all know it's a PhD in "Communications" or "Social Studies". 

  
Scientific Consensus is a thing, it just wasn't a thing when Dr Fauci and his acolytes were claiming it as their high fortress.</div>
