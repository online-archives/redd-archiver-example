    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">hmmm i'm not sure that i did understand your comment very well (english is not my 1st language) but i think you should check this :
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_and_violence
i read a little bit from it it's really good and i think will answer most of your questions

and i would like to ask you what would be your action if some country make a war on yours ? wouldn't you defense ? or you will just let them kill your friends and family while watching ? that's why we are only allowed to use violence and kill if someone came to us in our country and try to destroy us.
Islam is a religion that contain everything details in human life from how to enter a bathroom and what to say, to what to say when you are about to sleep or the moment you woke up ! 
and since it's complete full detailed religion, shouldn't it also contain on how to defense yourself when someone try to kill you ? 

much appreciation on your replies.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">sorry i commented then i re-checked i was wrong on something.

so i read the quran 8:12 and what you quote is right but as always as everyone else you misunderstood plus you didn't even try to research before commenting, i searched on google and here what i found :

"
The historical context for the passages (Quran 8:12 and 8:15) is that it was revealed at the battle of Badr. A battle in which the disbelievers (Pagans) of Makkah travelled 100s of miles to kill Muslims in Madinah. The pagans had 1000 soldiers, while the Muslims all they could gather to fight back in defence, had only 300 soldiers. Even though Prophet Muhammad (p) had left Makkah to find peace for its community without being persecuted, oppressed, they once again were trying to terrorize the Muslim community. 
" 
plus you didn't bring the whole aya lmao bro if you gonna take half of quran aya's you will totally misunderstood it.
don't go and confront people with arguments that will show that you didn't understand well and didn't try to put efforts :) . 

ps : read the translation of any aya you gonna bring before commenting :) </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">personally i see that anyone who's affected by the media is the one who has mind cancer.
so just deal with me a little bit i would like to explain something for you.
so a muslim person is a person who follows the islam. agreed ? same thing for christianity right ?
but what if that person doesn't follow the laws from the religion by not doing them? would we still say that he's a muslim/christian ? for me and in islam nope we don't.
so what happen if he do what's forbidden in his religion ? there's no argue with that he is totally not following his religion !!! 
SO in islam for a million times killing one human being is strictly forbidden and shall the killer go to hell, so do you think a real muslim will kill someone? nope, but a fake one would ! 
that's why i keep saying learn about the religion and DON'T JUDGE ANY RELIGION BY WHAT IT PEOPLE DOING.
plus the fact that anyone who is not muslim can go anywhere in public and shout "allah akhbar" and bomb him self. which is true and it happened !
 
and you said it yourself all the muslims you met are great but still your mind is affected by the media. this where you know how strong the media is it.

and please no need to use bad language against religions :) </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">ugh thank you i just knew that there's different in muslim english version and arabic one ! ( didn't knew that sorry )

and i checked it. it's traceable Hadith, which must have a certain conditions and qualifications to be accepted.( i don't know the whole conditions nor if this one is accepted )
but let's assume that it's 100% true and accepted, have you every visited a muslim country nowadays and they did that ? nope, they would be totally opposite on welcoming you people. plus yeah i know if it's 100% true i should do by it, but i think this hadith applies on their era's not ours. and the thing that i really dont think it's good to do by it is because like c'mon people will hate you for doing this thus will hate why you did it; so they will hate islam.

and about the second hadith i did not say that it's not true i said the opposite, that tells me you did not read my full comment :) ! 
same thing you guys always do read half thing and just judge by it !!! 
but anyway thank you so much because you replied to my comment and let me review few things and learn new stuff !!  </div>
