    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>Allegedly was a creep during the 1980s during the beauty pageant shows he owned.

Allegedly. 

>Allegedly (and found liable) for SA E Jean Carrol.

What proof? 

>Has publicly made creepy comments about his own daughter and hung around with Mr Island.

Stated that a boy her age would find her attractive. Like a normal father would say. 

Also literally cut ties with Epstein after he found out. Wasn’t on the list. 

>Has has fraudulent business dealings (and is now facing the courts) since the 1980s.

Mf biden is literally worse than that

>Banned transgender people from the military (undone by Biden).

The military is very physical. Having biological women with men and biological men with women would make things *very* complicated.  

>Wasted millions of taxpayer dollars on golf tournaments instead of governing.

Bro you should see what bidens doing with billions lmao

Gutted any sort of meaningful action that we have made under the Obama administration towards cheaper healthcare and climate action.

Like what? Were they actually beneficial? 

>Passed tax reforms that benefit only the wealthy.

What were the laws?

>Has publicly praised dictators such as Putin and Kim jong Un.

Oh no, a world leader is trying to not piss off other world leaders! How horrifying!

>Had tried to get Ukraine to interfere with a us election (pre 2020).

What? 

>Has taken boxes upon boxes of classified documents without clearance and stashed them in mar a Lago, potentially in reach of non authorized individuals.

“Potentially”. He just did it because he could. It was less of a traitor thing and more of an arrogance thing.

Also didn’t Biden do the exact same thing? 

>Interrupted the peaceful transfer of power between presidents and incited an insurrection attempt.

Oh, like how he stated “let there be a peaceful transfer of power” on twitter and told people to go home? Yeah it was all his fault. 

>Has advocated for Project 2025 and has made it his priority if he is re elected.

What’s project 2025?

>Has spread baseless claims about rigged elections.

Don’t seem baseless to me. I havent looked into it, but it does seem odd how democrats are wanting to make voting fraud easier. 

>Has disrespected the military by referring to them as "losers" when visiting a memorial cemetery.

What’s the context of this? What happened? Also Biden did the exact same thing, but instead kinda tried to hide it.

>The list goes on but the bottom line is that he is unfit for the oval office ever again. Now to what Biden has done:

1.	⁠>Be old and forgets things on occasion
2.	⁠>Not hitting hard enough against the GQP
3.	⁠>Eats too much ice cream?

Oh yeah, and

1. Covering up the crimes of his son

2. Allowed Ukrainian war to begin

3. Disallowed drilling on US soil, globally ruining gas prices

4. Demonized the Republican Party, creating an even bigger divide

5. ‘94 crime bill 

6. Bro sniffs children’s hair (if we’re gonna make personal attacks)

7. Spent hundreds of billions on Ukraine, despite having been able to prevent the war in the first place 

8. Immigration crisis

9. Worst pull out of Afghanistan. Left our allies to die and cost us BILLIONS.

10. Didn’t lift a finger to help the Hawaii fires.

There’s a lot more, but it’s 2 am and I gotta get to bed. Good night.</div>
