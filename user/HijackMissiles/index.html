You asked me why a Netflix entertainment show portrays someone as black, as if that means anything.

Works of fiction are that. Fiction. And their casting decision has been widely mocked by historians. 

I responded with an argument of what I considered equivalent seriousness.</div>

If I pick up a comic book about Spider Man in New York City, does that make Spider Man real? Will I see him if I go to NYC?

>In this [subreddit](https://slate.com/culture/2023/05/queen-cleopatra-black-netflix-show-race-history.html) the consensus was that Jesus along with the Hebrews would appear to definitely not be White,

Middle East peoples are not white. Egyptians are not white. Asia is not white. The Pacific Islands are not white. And none of those peoples are black. 

Something being not-white does not mean black. There is more than white or black.

>But there is no **clear consensus** that Jesus and the original Hebrews weren’t Black. 

There is. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929717302768](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0002929717302768)

Canaanites direct descendants are Lebanese. Canaanites are neighbors and directly referenced in Israeli history. 

Let us look at what modern day Lebanese people look like.

All that dark hair, dark skin. Not black. Not white either. If you wanted to use a color, it would be light brown.

Indeed, the blind appeal to authority is laughable.

You have not provided any evidence. For all we know, you are not even telling the truth.

Adorable.

Meanwhile... the other coronaviruses that jumped from animals to people...

229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, COVID-19.

So why is only the **last** of that line of naturally occuring jumps from animals to people the lab leak? Hmmmm?

Again, you are literally looking at 1-2-3-4-5-6 and instead of assuming 7 comes next assuming 117 comes next.

This is not evidence, just conspiratorial thinking. A host is not necessary.

Being in a line of natural events, you need greater evidence of the lab leak to controvert the long trend of natural occurrence.

You are arguing for a suspension of the observed trend in favor of something you have no evidence for. That is not a persuasive argument. It isn't much of an argument at all, really.</div>

And Germany has laws about Nazi shit for a reason. They thoroughly educate their children about what happened and forewarn against any repeat, and part of the prevention is the banning of any and all public displays of Nazism. 

If a sovereign democratic state that was previously the world's most common synonym for evil wants to, as a collective society, make it absolutely clear that this sort of behavior is unacceptable that seems just fine.</div>

That is literal suicide. Nobody just stands in the open waiting to have a jet drop a bomb on them.

Maybe Israel shouldn't be running the world's largest open air prison under total blockade, continually visiting abuses upon a people that fosters a small offshoot of violent extremists?

No. It is the fault of the violent extremists that they choose not to stand out on a beach completely exposed in the open 24/7 so that Israel may kill them when ready.

Also, there is no guarantee that Israel would accept that the sum total of their enemy was standing out on the beach. What is to stop them from saying that was a diversion and all the really important people are hiding among the civilians and then bombing the fuck out of civilians?

Oh yeah. Nothing.</div>
