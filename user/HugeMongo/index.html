why do you ask? do you have something against people of lower intellect? or, on the other hand, if I've done bad in school, how do you know it wasn't because of socioeconomic factors? funny that you mention it since "minorities" don't seem to do that well in school in america.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Not just testosterone, not by a long shot. It's not even the differences directly caused by testosterone. It's a big part of the controversy of allowing transgender men to compete in women's sports.

&gt;If changing your hormone level alone affected things so much, then TIFs would be competing on a par with men, or maybe even doing better because some TIFs take more testosterone than the average man has in his system, but they're not even on the radar in male sports.

&gt;     Even when corrected for body size, men’s lungs are bigger than women’s.

&gt;     A man takes 12 breaths per minute while a woman takes only nine breaths per minute on average.

&gt;     Men have larger hearts; women’s hearts beat faster.

&gt;     The electrical system of the heart is different in men and women: women have faster heart rates and a different electrocardiogram than a man.

&gt;     The time for the heart to return to baseline after a beat is longer for women than men.

&gt;     Food takes twice as long to pass through the digestive system of women compared with that of men.

&gt;     Food leaves a man’s stomach a third faster than a woman’s, and liquids twice as quickly.

&gt;     The average basal metabolic rate is about 6 percent higher in adolescent males than females and increases to about 10 percent higher after puberty. Females tend to convert more food into fat, while males convert more into muscle and expendable circulating energy reserves. Aggregated data of absolute strength indicates that females have, on average, 40–60% the upper body strength of males, and 70–75% the lower body strength.

&gt;     Males typically have larger tracheae and branching bronchi, with about 30 percent greater lung volume per body mass. On average, males have larger hearts, 10 percent higher red blood cell count, higher hemoglobin, hence greater oxygen-carrying capacity. They also have higher circulating clotting factors (vitamin K, prothrombin and platelets). These differences lead to faster healing of wounds and higher peripheral pain) tolerance.

&gt;At the end of the day, sexual dimorphism is a very real thing for humans. There are absolutely badass women out there, and we should celebrate their achievements. I always worry when I see a focus on "testosterone" though. I think that kind of single-factor thinking leads to incidents like the one involving Fallon Fox and Tamika Brents.

Guy points out a list of scientifically proven differences between men and women and get's his comment deleted because it doesn't fit the cuckold agenda.

Just wow.</div>
