<p>My god is this accurate.  Working on a program that has been in production for years.  It does optical character recognition on handwriting.  Over time it gets better as we check results and tweak the algorithms but it will never be 100% read with 100% accuracy as it is humans writing the documents it has to read.  Some people just have shitty handwriting.  The end users are complete idiots.  They expect it to see an item with $199.00 1/00 written on it and know that the person actually meant $1 99/100 ($1.99).</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I also recently had one where the LINQ was so deconstructed  that it was almost impossible to reconstruct to tell what it was doing.  The actual statement was a string of variables that held the different parts of the statement.  So I used the debugger to grab a full statement.  Then I had to figure out what was wrong with the statement and find where in code that was being passed.  There is such a thing as making things too many lines.</p>
<p>I will note that this is not 100% new problem and is off-shore coders doing it.  They have done it to SQL over and over and any object they create has a good chance of actually being one object hidden behind three other layers of other objects that don't actually do anything but create a new object.  Not talking about inheriting  and modifying the usage of an object.  I mean literally just call a new object with the passed parameters.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Look at the code and config files.  It will tell you where the logging is.  It could be a file or the event log or somewhere else.  But there will probably be config and definitely a call to the log method.  Log4Net is probably the most common file logging reference used.

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/2338036#11616879">The Agile Conspiracy</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Agile is crap to me in most cases.  It can be useful in some situations, especially when you are crossing multiple disciplines, but generally it creates projects that have to go back and forth too much.  Before we became &quot;agile&quot; it was so much easier to modify a project to meet a changing or misunderstood need.  Now that requires everyone to go back to the beginning.  Before we used to get all the stakeholders together to determine what was needed with the folks who were going to actually do it in from the beginning.  Now we don't have actual technical people in most projects until late in the game.  On top of that, everyone has their own little fiefdom to handle and they don't want anyone else stepping into it.  Truth is that every method of doing things has a use case.  Agile is good for very large and long projects, especially those that cross 3 or more teams.  Traditional works for tons of other cases.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>My wife and I use one to store and categorize recipes so that either of us can get to them.  Makes it easy to search by what we have to find something to make and allows us to modify or make notes on the recipes right there.  Yes we could type them up and store a bunch of folders with them, but it is so much easier for you to be able to open a tablet or phone and pull them up right there.  We used to do the same for the kids Christmas lists, just put them in documents and as one of us bought a thing on it we removed it from the list.</p></div>
