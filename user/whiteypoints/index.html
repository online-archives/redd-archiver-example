When I originally came to this post 3 days ago and my made original comment there was a completely different video that played.  The first two minutes was some basement dweller talking about how communism is bad so I didn't bother with the rest.  

Now it's linking to the video I watched (on Bitchute) 2 days ago that was so good I grabbed a copy.  But it's still up on Youtube after 4 days so I guess it's not being removed after all!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; The world needs to know, exactly, how it originated.

We know.  Here's a ~~video explaining which researchers in which lab~~

uh.. nevermind.  The video and the entire channel got deleted from Bitchute.  

Video was from a guy living in China who showed publicly available records (in chinese) detailing the research of a particular scientist studying bat diseases.  This started  many months beforehand so it wasn't a secret or anything to cover up.  Eventually the people in her lab were under self-imposed quarantine because they got infected.  Lots of documents later, we find out the original scientist is "missing" and she's been scrubbed from publicly available employee lists.   

The original source was quite clear.  How did it break out?  Since that "wet market" was only 850 feet away from the lab the speculation is that one of the lab workers went out for lunch and coughed on some fellow shoppers, before they started the self quarantine.</div>
