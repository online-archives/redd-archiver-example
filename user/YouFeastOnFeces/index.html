Apolitical are the most concerning, as if it's called /r/liberalssuck or /r/conservativessuck then you know what it's going to be, but if it's something generic like /r/desks or /r/chairs, you shouldn't expect virtuesignalling threads to be heavily moderated such as: 
 "Hey, I'm a [f]urrysexual gun toting pitbull owner who left an abusive relationship and lost [m]y job today, and I know it's not much, but turned this scrap pallet into a table + chair; love me plz".    Obviously I'm exaggerating and just made up sub names instead of using real examples, but you get the idea.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm not out to change someone's views.  You can believe in something different, and if that offends either one of us, and it stays up, that's proof that there's some semblance of an open forum.  It doesn't happen on reddit.

These "in groups" on reddit haven't been made by people in those groups, but rather manipulated by a few mods who want to make it appear so.  That's fine if it's clear that's what the group is, but there are many subs now on reddit with generic names that try and appear neutral, while constantly injecting political propaganda.  When you see a thread with maybe 30 comments, and "150 comments" listed at the top, you know things are getting heavily shaped, and those user's comments that get removed have no idea they're invisible to everybody else.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, I'll admit that's a bit crass, and I say retarded a bit more out of spite, since I literally got the mega b&amp;hammer for saying "retarded" one day, but then they magically lifted the auto-site permaban for it shortly after, but ignored my appeal.   Very strange.

Maybe the hostile makeup comes from the whole validation thing we all seek, where I hate being corralled like sheep with one  narrow viewpoint, and can recognize that because A is bad, it doesn't mean B is good.  But if I insult B, it must mean I'm Pro-A + all the ragebait.   This binary thinking they're imposing on people is just making the whole place stupider, and making people think they're all on extreme teams, and this comment grooming of anything outside of that image only makes it look even more-so like that to any onlookers.</div>

If you beg, and don't have anything in your history they don't like, you MIGHT get it rolled back, but likely it will get snagged by the filter again soon after.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You must have found yourself on the wrong side of the politics that they wanted to show.  Being Finnish, I have no  idea what political parties they're cheering on, or demonizing, though.

But like if something is in a super lefty sub, and it says "Biden cleared of wrongdoing", you have to cheer, or get banned.  The opposite is true if it's somewhere like a conservative one where it says "trump is cleared of wrongdoing", you cheer them on, or be banned.  And if it's the opposite party is posted, you're supposed to boo them, and get outraged.  No critical thinking allowed.  If you try and be genuine and impartial, you can even get labeled a "concern troll".  Yes, that's a thing, look it up.</div>
