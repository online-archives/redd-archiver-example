    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">How the hell have we sank so far, that Americans are citing with the people that were screaming tears of joy after 9/11? 

Look at all of the Arab nations that surround Gaza. Not a single one, wants to take them in. Why is that? Because they cause internal strife and war and conflicts in every single nation they go into. Look at Jordan for first is sake and the civil war there. 

Look what happened in Kuwait… and when Iraq invaded, they were smart and kick them out because they were sympathizers with the Iraqi govt. 

Everyone says “you should read more” , I agree I should. And I’m not saying the Jews have not done fucked up things because they most certainly have but that is war. Every time the Palestinians haven’t offered peace they have refused. Every… single… time… 

Why? Why not settle for 90% of what it is that you want and then keep trying for more? Why subject your people to the intense suffering? - Because they don’t give a shit. Until the people rise up and overthrow Hamas themselves, it’s going to keep happening. 

I don’t blame the Jews, one bit for wanting to go in and wipe them out considering all the aid that they give them is just used against them. The Palestinians do not want peace. Full fucking stop. They want them eliminated, and they were pissed off because they were about to sign an accord with other Middle Eastern countries to help legitimize them and increase trade in peace. 

They could not let that happen, so they committed one of the worst Jewish atrocities since World War II. 

Now you can argue all you want about Netanyahu and if he actually knew it was gonna happen, and so on so forth… that mf needs to relinquish power, but that is honestly not the main point.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If you want to know which side is the bad side, look at whoever is cheering on the death and destruction of others. As far as I can tell, and from everything I’ve seen, the Jews, just wanted to be left the fuck alone, and have their hostages returned. 

Perfect example, Ukraine. Look at the videos of all those Russian influencers, celebrating firing, rockets and killing people in the opening days. You shouldn’t be hungry for war, you should not be celebrating it, it should be the last fucking resort. if you’re the one going looking for it, welcoming it, you are the bad guy.

As for the palestinas vs the Jews… the Israelis were not the ones firing rockets blindly into civilian areas. 
 Biggest example we can identify with?: 9/11

 Wanna know who the bad guys are? Look at the ones who were celebrating and crying tears of joy in the streets over 3000 people being murdered.</div>

But I Mmmm it def wasn’t the labs fault. Just curious, why did they not allow any inspectors in then? And deleted all the data? And the doctors disappeared that spoke out about it? 

Don’t take a COVID shit in my lap and tell me it’s a kitten. 

Not a coverup… didn’t come from them…
