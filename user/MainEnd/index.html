And IP1 when it was the main sub it had the same tendencies but at least it had some moderation, Ice's fault for enabling it, but the toxic people were the users, not him.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm telling you it's about him (And r/Ice_Poseidon owned by him), it was just a part of it, people went there to make memes, talk shit about him, praise him, talk about the people in the streams, give ideas, everything revolving his content... He used to make a reddit recap every single stream. 

r/Ice_Poseidon2 was made to hate on him and make his life worthless, they made the city of LA inspect his house over a lot of claims, he was in the process of releasing his own streaming platform and people from that sub went to the investors and started to fuck with them and their families so they pulled out with around 600k already invested on him... He had to move out of LA, now he lives in Texas and he hasn't cared about the Reddit since that investors thing happened months before.

He was getting evicted every couple of months too, it was a shitshow tbh.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">r/Ice_Poseidon was his sub, he's a livestreamer and that sub was part of the content, he let the viewers take too much confidence and it turned into a shithole, he closed it for a bit to try to get rid of the toxicity but that only made it worse, some of the toxic fans created r/Ice_Poseidon2, managed by these viewers and advertised as ''no censorship'' so by that time it was out of his control, all the people moved to r/Ice_Poseidon2 and he didn't have a say, Reddit admins counted both subs as the same one, so any decision that affected one or the other it was going to affect both in the same scale, that's why both subs got suspended.

Edit: Ice Poseidon is the name of the guy on YouTube.</div>
