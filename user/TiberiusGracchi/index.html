That cost the state about a million dollars per patient to support plus other costs for the roughly 25 year life expectancy of HIV patients [and cost the state over $160 million in medical fees that could have been avoided with a timely and effective response.](https://www.wthr.com/amp/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/inside-epidemic-hiv-outbreak-brings-massive-cost/531-bb6811b6-9d9b-4e5c-b428-0b3fd737dba6)

While more people were technically employed there was a boom in population so the per capita it wasn’t the great improvement Pence claimed. [extra sourcing - 4. Pence also claimed, "there’s more Hoosiers going to work than ever before."  Verify: That’s an overstatement.  We looked into this claim Tuesday night when Indiana's Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb made a similar statement during his GOP convention speech. It’s true the raw number of workers is at an all-time high, but that’s due to population growth.  The percentage of Hoosiers with jobs is not a record. The current unemployment rate is 5 percent in Indiana. The record best was 2.9 percent in October 2000.](https://www.kare11.com/amp/article/news/politics/national-politics/verify-indianas-economy-under-mike-pences-leadership/89-278582029)

Indiana’s road infrastructure was  a total mess under Pence - severely depleting state reserves and borrowing money after a major bridge on I65 caused a month long closure as emergency repairs were needed. [More on the I-69 mess](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/06/18/mike-pence-donald-trump-public-private-partnerships-mitch-daniels-interstate-69-isolux-bloomington/388756001/)

His big education funding actually accounted for less money than average as it was only 2.3% increase when the state had been averaging a 2.7% spending increase on education.

They’re picking the best players from the pool of players they have. If there are fewer white players it’s because some people have other avenues for success or for some reason there isn’t a large number of white players with NFL level talent.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is a completely bullshit hack attempt at a straw man. The league is mostly Black due to a mix of talent and socioeconomic reasons, partially that non working class and poor White people have economic opportunities that mean they don’t have to specialize in sports and rely on that as a way to rise socio economically. 

How you got the idea that I believe there is something wrong with White people existing is a massive leap to conclusions that is not supported by anything I have said. In fact it’s a projection of your insecurities. There is nothing wrong with White people existing  — and I would have to hate myself as I am partially of European descent. 

*There is a problem with systemic racism and White Supremacy* as these ideologies artificially elevate White people over other groups as a way to not actually have to compete with them on the Free Market. The argument that I and others make is let’s tear down these artificial, oppressive systems and if you actually believe in Meritocracy and equality of opportunity you would support breaking down these barriers as well.


There is nothing wrong with White people, but it is wrong to completely ignore all the evidence that there are systems and institutions in place that unfairly advantage White people to the literal existential detriment of other races.</div>

As President he also signed for Amnesty in the 80s. Conservatives are massive authoritarian hypocrites on gun laws. 

Most actual Leftists from the more left ends of DEMSOC, to Anarchists, Zapatistas, ANCOMs, and even Marxists believe in the ownership of guns, especially for the working classes as protection for state oppression and acts of violence from Right Wing reactionaries against the general working class class and the various minority groups that make up segments of the working class. Even Marx and Engels are staunchly pro gun and Engels served in the Prussian military as an artillery man. Smedley Butler was the most decorated Marine in history and Orwell states a gun should be in every worker’s home and he served in the British Army.</div>

The sad thing is in your first message you passionately argue against people generalizing and stereotyping White people, yet you take the bad actions of a few individuals and decide to not only stereotype them, but actively engage in attacking their identity and engaging in harmful acts towards gay and trans men. It’s kind of wild that you don’t want people to do that to you or white people yet you’re cool doing it to gay men and trans women. Do you hold the same views for Trans men? 


Again you can almost totally cut out Mulvaney from 99% of your life with only the most minimal of effort. Literally all celebs are narcissistic to a degree and they all hide behind a public mask.</div>

Statistically, she is much safer around trans women than straight men. [Here is some info that might help you understand trans folks and the pernicious myths about them.](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/5/13/17938088/transgender-people-rights-myths)

[Myth : Letting trans people use the bathroom or locker room matching their gender identity is dangerous](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/5/13/17938102/transgender-people-bathrooms-locker-rooms-schools)

The fears of trans women hurting assigned at birth females is more a condemnation of us straight guys than trans women as it’s misplaced fear about the very real and very high chance  women in the US will be sexually assaulted or raped by straight men, generally a guy she knows.</div>

Dude, I am a former college LB who went to a liberal school and almost no one said shit about me lifting or being an athlete and the one or two guys that did were the idiots who believe in the Alpha/ Beta/ Sigma bullshit. I went hunting during deer season all the time and brought back meat which my Leftist friends ate and we actually talked about ethical hunting and Permaculture.

UMAR. 

Kendi isn’t the end all or be all of anti racism or critical race scholarship and I implore you to expand on what you’re reading and ask what specifically do you disagree with him on? 

The LDS Church deserves criticism for its continued racist policies even towards its own BIPOC and AAPI members. That said if you wanna date someone who is Mormon, go for it! That shouldn’t automatically disqualify them as there are a lot of good people who happen to be LDS or former LDS.</div>

All equity means is realizing we all start at different spots and literally providing mostly children opportunities to have the opportunity to  all get a high quality education, get healthcare, and be able to eat. It’s literally the smartest way to organize because we maximize the ability of our human capital and then we truly let natural differences in skill and intellect lead toward the best  and most innovative minds running things. It’s literally saying we’ll give everyone a chance because it will maximize our collective strength.

 You get we provide very cushy socialist policies to the Capitalist class via subsides and bailouts, right? 

[Whenever the government provides opportunities in privileges for white people and rich people they call it “subsidized” when they do it for Negro and poor people they call it “welfare.” The fact that is the everybody in this country lives on welfare. Suburbia was built with federally subsidized credit. And highways that take our white brothers out to the suburbs were built with federally subsidized money to the tune of 90 percent. Everybody is on welfare in this country.](https://cityobservatory.org/dr-king-socialism-for-the-rich-and-rugged-free-enterprise-capitalism-for-the-poor/)

[The problem is that we all to often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor. That’s the problem.](https://cityobservatory.org/dr-king-socialism-for-the-rich-and-rugged-free-enterprise-capitalism-for-the-poor/)

Capitalists don’t want equity because then they would lose the ability to engage in wage theft and exploit people for their labor. The American Capitalist economy has been built on the exploitation of Black Americans and immigrants.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Actually read Sowell, he makes the bootstraps argument and literally blames Black people for struggling to overcome systemic racism

Even amongst scholars with a more Centrist or Conservative position see his bootstraps argument as foolish as it ignores systemic racism and makes a genetic and cultural flaw argument saying Black people are inept and incapable of bettering themselves and essentially should be where they are since they essentially allowed themselves to be inferior. You know real self hate bullshit

[Sowell seems to assert that slavery and its lingering effects have no impact on the current destructive acts or sensibilities of African Americans.](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/21122/white-supremacy-vs-negro-ineptitude-sowells-myths-of-economic-inequality)

[does not address specific times that the U.S. government explicitly took or stole wealth from African Americans, such as the U.S. government taking Frederick Douglass’ contribution to the Freedmen Bank, then closing the bank and never returning Douglass’ funds or the funds of other contributors. Nor did they redirect those seized funds into other efforts to aid newly freed African Americans. The same can be said of the destruction of Black Wall Street in Tulsa.  So, yes—white supremacy only succeeds because of Negro ineptitude. But we cannot ignore the U.S. government’s rooted history of actively destroying or stealing Black wealth.   Thus, I’d like Thomas Sowell to be more balanced in his factual presentation of why African Americans continue to be second-class citizens. It’s a combination of white supremacy and Negro ineptitude. To highlight one without the other is unempirical and can be malicious](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/21122/white-supremacy-vs-negro-ineptitude-sowells-myths-of-economic-inequality)</div>

The 13th loophole creates the downward for profit spiral that leads us to having the highest prison population on Earth.

Sowell is also stating that it is wrong to give women more rights and economic freedom as well as the acceptance of LBGTQ folks. He is insanely conservative</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The black family survived centuries of slavery and generations of Jim Crow, but it has disintegrated in the wake of the liberals’ expansion of the welfare state.

Lavern literally destroyed families as people were stolen from their families in Africa to go to the Americas. Then if they found a partner their partner, themselves, or their kids could be - and regularly were - sold to other slave owners and separated. 

The children of raped slaves were not allowed to be with their fathers and mixed race kids were denied their claim to their father’s inheritance. 

Jim Crow created the school to prison pipeline via the 13th Amendment and re legalized slavery in the South — hence chain gangs. 

Separate but Equal allowed for states to steal money from HBCUS ([over half a billion dollars just in Tennessee alone](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996617532/behind-the-underfunding-of-hbcus)aand underfund k-12 which has led to the socio economic conditions that have created the school to prison pipeline.</div>

The rule was created because FFS 40 years ago teams would pass on a guy like McDaniel because they would be concerned about how people would perceive them hiring a Black coach…
