    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; This is Reddit. You submit posts you feel fit. Downvotes are supposed to mean "I don't feel this correctly contributes to the subreddit" but instead they mean "I don't like this" and are usually followed by a moderator also personally disliking it and thus removing the content and citing some bull shit reason despite "moderation based on personal feelings" being specifically forbidden in the official Reddit Moddiquette.


Yes OP I understand that you really get off on being offended by the idea that subreddit mods censored you for the sake of a political agenda that they are abusing their authority to push onto the general public, but this is obviously not what happened—your post over there just isn’t any sort of example where someone was murdered by words, and the mods even explained this to you when they removed your post

If you truly believe that your screenshots of these two tweets is legitimate r/MurderedByWords material, then you need to explain exactly how—because all it looks like, at best, is the sort of thing that isn’t particularly funny, or even coherent, but that you convince yourself is funny anyway (regardless of whether or not you actually understand it) because you agree politically with the person posting it 

So first, please explain what exactly is supposedly being communicated here in Fitton’s response to Comey’s pro-LGBTQ photo, and then walk us through how exactly that translates into a verbal murder or burn</div>

Being “murdered by words” usually involves one person making a statement or a claim, and then someone else coming along and meticulously dismantling every single little goddamn element of said statement or claim with surgical precision and extreme prejudice

This is a photo of Comey wearing a pro-LGBTQ shirt followed by a reply from Fitton with nothing but a photo of himself wearing a shirt that reads

&gt; *Because no one is above the law!*


Does Fitton believe Comey should be arrested for wearing a shirt that openly displays support for Pride month or something

Because that’s an admittedly very weak connection, but if that’s not what it is then I have no idea what it could possibly be

Would you perhaps be able to walk us through it and explain in at least some level of detail what kind of clown world you live in where this kind of shit is even remotely considered to be the sort of incisive, devastating and excruciatingly elaborate burn that would normally qualify it as appropriate and acceptable content for a subreddit like r/MurderedByWords</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; When you say this do you there include the official Red Cross report on deaths being around 300.000 


Perhaps you will find [the exhaustively-sourced Wikipedia page on Criticism of Holocaust Denial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial) to be more authoritative on this subject than a single page of numbers taken out of context in an attempt to refute the endless mountains of evidence to the contrary—especially considering

&gt; In the 1978 official bulletin, entitled "False Propaganda", **the ICRC denounced Holocaust denial** and confirmed that the agency "Never published—or even compiled—statistics of this kind which are being falsely attributed to it" and stated that its mission was "to help war victims, not to count them", and **questioned how they would have even been able to obtain such statistics had they wanted to, given that they were "only able to enter only a few concentration camps...in the final days of the war".**


&gt; The agency states that **the figures used are "the number of deaths recorded by the International Tracing Service on the basis of documents found when the camps were closed"**, and accordingly **bear no relation to the total death tolls, since the Nazis destroyed much documentation, and that many deaths occurred in camps where prisoners were generally not registered.** The ICRC considers this misrepresentation as "propaganda", and because these claims regarding the ICRC were used for the defense of Ernst Zündel at his trial in 1985, critics state that despite the agency's attempts to demonstrate the truth, Holocaust deniers have continued to rely on ICRC based disinformation.

Sorry OP, I should’ve realized you were one of those people, so that’s my bad for taking you seriously

&gt; where literally everything is racist if it allows me to pretend that I’m some kind of victim for having to suffer the inevitable consequences of openly being such a huge fucking racist 


Alright well I’m glad we can at least agree on this

&gt; Because they absolutely do.


Well no, but I certainly can’t stop you from believing whatever dumb shit you want to believe 

&gt; Fuck me for considering the aforementioned genocide of the non-native people to be savage. I guess I should be more sensitive of the ones murdering people over the color of their skin.


Well to put it a bit more accurately, fuck you for claiming that black people are inherently violent, and that it’s compelling them to engage in endless genocide against white foreigners, when the claim of white genocide in South Africa has been repeatedly exposed as an objectively false narrative manufactured by white nationalists to perpetuate their racist bullshit

&gt; Because, I don't know, maybe (just maybe) it's dumb to assume "white voodoo magic" (see the parent comment) is to blame for food running out after eating it all.


I don’t know, maybe it’s totally fucking racist to say that Africans are universally so fucking stupid that they are all literally unable to understand the idea that you have to get more food after you eat the food you already have

&gt; After reading an article chronicling acts by the native South Africans so heinous that I seldom hear about anything even remotely as sub-human anywhere else in the world AND they feel no remorse and laugh about their deeds. 


You read some dumb racist shit about how Africans, unlike white people, are generally incapable of higher-level abstract thinking—and that this kind of limited intelligence makes them inherently immoral and evil—and you just kind of decided that it’s objectively true because it reinforces your shitty racist beliefs

&gt; I even used verbiage like "If it weren't such a dangerous slippery slope" and "I'd almost suggest," but this is the internet, where nobody actually reads people's comments, but instead they just auto-corrects them to whatever they need to be outraged! 


Thank fucking god you included these qualifiers to make it clear that there are only some circumstances in which you feel like it would be okay to label “the Africans” as subhuman animals

&gt; Better lump me in with the actual racists for fucking ~~thinking out loud because this is a dystopian world where thought crime is a thing, apparently.~~ openly expressing such incredibly shitty racist beliefs and then whining about having to deal with the inevitable consequence of being called out on it


Well I mean yeah, obviously—you’re not exactly leaving a lot of room for ambiguity here</div>
