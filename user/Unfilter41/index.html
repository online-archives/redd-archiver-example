Greenwald has called Tucker a socialist, just to give you an idea how incompetent this faux leftist group is.

&gt;No, he isn't. 

Tucker is right wing, Greenwald is right wing with delusions, and Dore is right wing. 


&gt;Sounds like you have not actually listened to both sides of the story and heard/seen all the evidence before coming to a rational conclusion.

There an echo in here? I've listened to both sides and that's why I know you only replied with one side. 


&gt;The things Cenk and **Ana** has said is far worse than what Dore said. Again, Dore didn't sexually harass Ana.

Dore is right wing. 


&gt;Like saying 'nice news skirt' sarcastically when someone (a friend and his senior) is wearing something inappropriate for a news room and everyone laughs at it? A bit too many, then Dore felt bad and apologized and she accepted his apology? yeah. Usually sexual harassment holds some sexual intent. 

Dore really plays up his sexual harassment story, I recognize all the details you're using because you only ever listened to his side.  



&gt; they guess who's segment segments and Cenk said sexist shit plenty of times 

Being raunchy isn't the same as sexually harassing a coworker. It sure didn't give Jimmy the right to harass Ana</div>

Then why do people keep finding him lying about vaccines


&gt;Who is excusing sexual harassment?

You, apparently



&gt;
&gt; So he can't go on 'millionaire show run by billionaire conservatives' to promote pro-working class, anti-war, class solidarity sentiment or otherwise it isn't populism or spreading truth to power??

Can a right wing terrorist lie his way through an interview with Jimmy?

&gt;Context and nuance matters to good faith adults... Saying he platforms a terrorist movement is deceptive af.

Okay, then saying Tucker platforms leftism is equally decorative. 


&gt;He made a joke about someone wearing inappropriate attire to work

Yes "jokes" can be, and are, sexual harassment. 

&gt; his joke literally pales in comparison to the things Cenk and Ana have said

Talking about dirty things does not give you free reign to sexually harass someone. Jimmy strikes me as the kind of guy who would molest a sex worker and then claim it's not so bad.</div>

It's not my fault nobody wants to associate with Dore besides right wing grifters like Tucker, militias, and disgraced ex-Intercept journalist Glen Greenwald who thinks Tucker is a socialist. These nuts clearly all have brain rot.

Is that why the right is best known today for trying to censor basic stuff getting taught in school under the lie that it's all critical race theory?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I see two things going on here. One, it's definitely possible to use slurs and be racist against white people. r/BlackPeopleTwitter sees it as less of a concern than overarching racial justice. It's kinda cringe, and clearly it causes a lot of people (like you) to react poorly.

But on the other hand, there's a ton of people (right here in the comments section) who think institutional racism is justified, ostensibly because they got called honky in the past. 

There are black racists and black ethnostaters. Thankfully they're remarkably powerless. I can't say the same about white racists.</div>
