I've never lived for any extended period of time in the South, but I have relatives who moved there.  Some people in the South are a bit ignorant but they at least don't try to hide their racism behind political correctness.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I can't find the specific thread now, but there was a discussion on one of the meta-subreddits like r/ModHelp where the r/News mods wanted to have the Karma requirements be a 6-month old account and 40,000 comment Karma.

That is a very high karma requirement.  They claim that it's to get rid of spam, but I don't think it actually makes sense.  As of 2022, the average karma on Reddit typically hovers around 1000, give or take.  And most people have Link Karma, not comment Karma.  40,000 Comment Karma ensures that either you have to be a Power User who got there by conforming to the narrative, or you have have bought a Power User's account.

Another thing I saw was that there were a lot of pro-Ukraine accounts that got manually approved by moderators.  There were also a lot of old accounts that suddenly come back online, indicating that they were purchased from other people.

Reddit is supposed to crack down on the latter practice because it often serves as a source of spam. However, in cases like the Ukraine War discussion, it appeared that Reddit didn't enforce these rules as rigorously just as long as the posters were pro-Ukrainian. A similar phenomenon occurred after the events of January 6th, where a ton of dormant accounts suddenly became active again after more than 8 years of inactivity.  Those accounts weren't just saying, "We need to punish the people who rioted," but they were advocating for drastic measures beyond that, such as advocating for lengthy sentences for anyone remotely connected to the event.

Now I do support the Ukrainians and I believe that there were people who got way out of line on Jan 6th, but even then it was impossible ignore such extreme astroturfing.</div>

The person OP is accusing a Taiwanese person of being a "tankie" because they believe that Taiwan should control their own border policy.  He's probably more communist than the person he accuses of being a "tankie".</div>
