    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><blockquote>
<p>I was trying to refer more to the way that Java loads each object's parent classes and so on into memory at runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Java keeps all structures in memory in order to give a feature called reflection; meaning that a program knows everything about itself. This can be used for dynamic invocation of methods and enumeration of classes (for instance for plugin-functionality), also it can be used by the run-time itself to provide better code optimization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course Java will always be slower than C/C++ because of the JVM overhead</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Java needs to do a trade-off; Java can't always make the most optimal code because that would lead to a much longer load time (and impede performance during JIT-compilation). It's not due to JVM overhead - it's a consciously weighed decision.</p>
<p>Java can however sometimes perform better than C++ in certain situations. C++'s method of linking imposes a few restrictions of what code can and cannot be optimized properly because the context is unclear. For instance; Java can inline methods across dynamically linked libraries, something C++ cannot. Java can use CPU or GPU extensions that C++ needs specific compilation for (like new SIMD extensions).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I still stand by my claim that Java is much faster than Python.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguing against this would show a complete lack of understanding of the differences of Java and Python. Java will always outperform Python significantly. Firstly; Python is an interpreted language; it doesn't get compiled to native code. Even if you use something like a Python -&gt; C transpiler, you will still be stuck with Python's type system which has a severe performance penalty due to the very nature of weak and dynamic typing.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>A beginners language should have proper static typing. Python's severe performance penalty should get more focus when people make a choice in languages. A decade and a half ago, VB6 was shunned in &quot;serious business&quot; because of performance considerations, even though VB6 was significantly faster than Python (as long as you avoided the <code>VARIANT</code> datatype). The use of Python in business is a very dubious technical decision.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Java's trade-off compared to C++ is not in performance, but memory consumption. Java is comparatively equal to C++ in performance (average about 1.5x - 2x slowdown). Perl, Python and PHP is <em>significantly</em> slower, sometimes up to 200x slowdown, and with about the same memory consumption as Java (or even higher), the expected minimum generally being about 10x slowdown. </p>
<p>Java switched to JIT compilation in 1996 and still this myth is being thrown about, even though it has been patently false for 19 years.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I'm not directly disagreeing with you, I just think that your opinion is one-dimensional and some of your opinions are up for discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's &quot;interesting&quot; that some people try hard to read stuff into everything. See the IIS server. Is it so hard to let a user-space listen on port 80 TCP? No.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right, IIS doesn't need to be a device driver, it's done like that <em>purely</em> to get performance enhancements. And if you look at the numbers, IIS outperforms all other web servers that come anywhere near close IIS in terms of functionality and flexibility. Kernel drivers will perform better than user-space programs because kernel-drivers doesn't have this giant police checking every bit and byte in case you do something wrong. It's not because Windows is inherently inefficient, it's because that's the price we pay for stability and security. This is why DOS was so goddamn fast; it just didn't care. Linux kernel drivers also has a performance benefit over user-mode space, which is why stuff that doesn't strictly need to access hardware resources also are put there; like video encoding software (would you trust user-space to compress 1080p video on-the-fly for real-time communication?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. Does it need to haggle IRQs? No. What is it doing in the frigging Ring0?! There. Is. No. Excuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technically, it's Ring-1 :P Linux has one kernel ring, Windows has two; one for the OS and one for device drivers.
If you ignore performance (which is why they did it), there's no other justifiable reasons for http.sys existence. I still think it's one-sided to consider that kernel drivers only ever should handle hardware, even when there can be other justifications for doing so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The act of rendering is the job of a driver. The act of managing is not. Weirdly enough for all over OS's this works great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's your assumption, it might not have been a result from &quot;managing&quot; at all, we don't know.</p></div>

<p>User-space programs (regular programs) don't have access to hardware resources and a privileged instruction set; they can't call interrupts, they can't register new interrupts, they cannot send or receive via ports, and they cannot change the IRQ priority (among other things).

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Writing a library in C++ is way more difficult than in Java. Firstly, you'll need <em>two</em> declarations, one regular and one export (the .h file included for the .lib, .so or .dll). Secondly, C++ has complete type erasure. Writing libraries with C++ is extremely tedious, while in Java it doesn't take any extra time at all; all public classes and methods can be loaded, and that's it. In C++ there's also two types of libraries, one for static linking and one for dynamic linking, and these needs to be determined depending on what they are supposed to do and how they are supposed to be integrated in the application. Which brings up another case; there is no penalty in Java for dynamic linking, but there is in C++; dynamically linked libraries in C++ needs to conform to what the program expects due to memory offsets, while Java doesn't care, because it not designed that way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tomorrow, ask the monkey in the cubicle next to you to create a library without his favorite IDE. Just give him notepad and a CLI. He will be outed for the magnificent fool he truly is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the Java developers you out as &quot;monkeys&quot; which went to college and only know Java, did actually learn Java with something like notepad and a command line, because for some reason that's how Java is taught in college. Using a text editor and cli also doesn't make you a better programmer. In fact I'd argue that it makes you worse, because you're wasting your own time and productivity because you refuse the help an IDE will give you. People convince themselves that they &quot;can't&quot; use an IDE because they're so used to having to browse a million different source code files just to figure out what that function they need actually does. And someone can't fathom how IDE's somehow can magically do that for you by pressing alt+f1 and show the source of the function in an instant without grepping at all. Stop being elitist about writing code in a manner that was typical in 1970 because you won't impress anyone.</p>
<p>Every time I bring up how IDE's are a good productivity tool, people start acting like they are doing some sort of task that is impossible to automate on a computer. It's not impossible, it's not even hard, and most IDE's will do them for you so you don't have to. It has nothing to do with &quot;being better&quot;, it has to be with being blind and impenetrable to reason.</p></div>

<p>I wish they give us more freedom for dangling pointers and low level access with C#, and especially directX like stuff.</p>

<p>You're free to use pointers to read and write unmanaged memory in C#.. You just need to mark the method as <code>unsafe</code>. If you want more control between managed and unmanaged memory you need to use <code>System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal</code> which can turn unmanaged memory segments into .NET reflected types, and do other stuff like allocate unmanaged heap memory (default in C# for pointers is via the <code>stackalloc</code> operator, since that's what you'll be using them for generally anyway) and stuff like that. There are no restrictions to pointers in C#, but you just have to be aware that C# is not C++, and managed and unmanaged memory are two different things :P</p></div>

Java's design is vastly different from C++, and it gives a lot of benefits for the programmer. For instance take writing libraries; completely trivial in Java, extremely non-trivial in C++. Multiple inheritance. Stack/heap and how that affects the lifetime of objects and how you deal with objects you no longer need depdending on where they're located. Thread-safety. Networking. Binary compatibility.</p>
<p>No, there's not a conspiracy between colleges and pointy-haired bosses that synthetically keeps Java alive. Java is a solid choice with very reasonable trade-offs and that's why people use it.</p></div>

<p>C/C++/D usually outperforms Java, but that's not always the case. C/C++/D all use a lot less memory than Java, which is Java's main trade-off. At virtually every other metric (for instance maintainability, ease of development, deployment) Java wins by a fair amount.</p>
<p>D is however an awesome language and I really hope it reaches a popularity that some day makes C++ obsolete. I don't think that it will be able to compete with Java though, as it doesn't really solve the same problems Java does. It does however solve most if not all of C++'s intricate annoyances.</p>

This kind of pressure completely murdered Reddit in the start for days on end. Hell, even now after being online for a decade Reddit is still completely unstable and unreliable. So yeah, definitely.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>They also needs to take a serious look at their use of try-catch because it is wrong :P</p>
<pre><code>try
{
    ....
}
catch (Exception) &lt;-- BAD!
{
    ....
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is not how exceptions are supposed to be handled. If you have an unhandled exception, there's an entire functionality in ASP.NET to handle that eventuality. Removing the &quot;catch-all&quot; clauses will reduce code duplication and improve debugging and logging.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>C# is very cool. What makes people think it's &quot;less cool&quot; than Python is that it's a language that has prerequisites you need to understand in order to use it properly, so it's not as easy to immediately get into making it less attractive for hobbyists. But in any technical terms it is thousands of times &quot;better&quot; than Python for a myriad of reasons.</p>
<p>I also immediately assumed it was made in Python, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was not.</p></div>
