    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Nope, here is why;

The mods of the subreddit originally allowed anyone to comment, but it was instantly brigaided by every leftist / communist subreddit and Reddit admins did nothing to ban or stop those people.

You are allowed to have a community of likeminded people (echo chamber) **as long as you state the intentions and rules of the community**

I mean how can you even argue this in good faith? Reddit admins recently rempved this post: (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/fub7xo/introducing_the_solidarity_award_a_100) from /r /announcements because all the top comments were pointing out the hypocrisy of Reddit. All big social media sites have been censoring and banning anyone that disagrees with progressive liberal ideology **and using this ability to SWAY PEOPLES OPINIONS when they unknowingly enter the space thinking it is a place of neutral discussion that accurately portrays society.**

Read /r/ watchredditdie and see the TONS AND TONS of evidence. Its all right there. Tons of evidence. Go watch some YouTube videos on this topic. Go watch Smartereveryday's videos on this topic.</div>

Reddit is a Platform, so they aren't supposed to be curating information (aside from law breaking stuff or spam)
The blurred lines of what is "rule breaking" is how they get away with this.

It is so important that this stuff gets resolved, otherwise next election they will have the internet so locked down that you won't be able to find a single opinion other than what they want you to see and think</div>

I dose as early as possible in the morning and don't eat anything before or 2 hours after taking it. I use capsules and drink only hot water to make them melt faster.

A guy followed me over to / r/kratom and told me "I hope you OD on kratom you piece of trash" and I explained how safe kratom is and that it helps opiate addicts recover, and just put out my hand...

I do not appreciate the way that they talk about killing people. 

To me, thats a line that you shouldn't cross on a website like Reddit, where there could be mentally ill people that will go out and do the things that they discuss so seriously on that subreddit.

I support a ban of that subreddit if they continue, and it is rare for me to support that.

I once commented there, just stated my opinion about a topic, and was told things like "your whole family would be better off if you killed yourself today"

Never saw anything like that before on the internet. Disturbing.</div>
