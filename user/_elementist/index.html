    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Integration is difficult, but that is a difficult problem. I'm not sure I have the solution.

&gt;the rape rate in sweeden, germany, and the uk skyrocketing

That has been explained over an over again as having nothing to do with immigration or Muslims. tldr changes in how rape is reported and tried have caused significant increases in the stats, not racial or immigration issues.

&gt;Unemployed masses of refugees in Sweden, not skilled enough to fill the positions available, etc. Like do we just throw money at them, try to re-educate them, and hope it works? for children, it WILL work. But im not so positive thinking when it comes to the adults. people are super stubborn everywhere.

I think this is truly the problem. Where I live you don't get to immigrate unless you have a skillset and the ability to provide for yourself and your family, so this would apply mostly to refugees. For refugees, I do support paying for their education and holding them accountable to our laws. If they choose to integrate then citizenship should be an open path, but if they don't then they can't stay forever (3-5 year status or something. I don't know, this is a hugely complex issue)

Basically, if you need to pay for those coming in now so that 30-40-50 years from now they and their families are integrating and giving back to society, its a long term investment for the better.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Basically that's the case. The middle east isn't going to be "solved" by europe or america. The only way its going to become stable is if it finds its own equilibrium and decides to build on that stability, which you can't force them to do. As long as we continue interfering in the middle east for oil, they will never reach any sort of equilibrium, and the tension between the religions and societies will never have time to cool off.

Honestly, immigration is the worlds best bet in my opinion, but they have to make sure they learn from the mistakes of past generations. 

First generation immigration is usually great, but due to racism, systemic issues and poverty second generation immigrants are at significant risk of radicalization and violence. Immigrants have to be accepted, and given a path to succeed in your country. Europe and North America has worked for a long time with what is essentially a 'permanent' underclass of immigrants or people of foreign descent, the current black problems I think have a lot to do with that (but I know much less about that than this subject honestly), and as long as you have that underclass with limited social mobility out of it (something that is getting worse, not better, in the US) then you're at risk.

Currently there are muslim populations all over the world, I would say about 20-30% of them are actively secularizing now. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are examples, and we had absolutely nothing to do with them and they were somewhat sheltered from the worst of colonialism and the religious wars before that in comparison. 

The problem for the rest is (in my mind), as long as the west exists as a crucible to harden their beliefs against, they will not change. The west has to turn itself from a direct enemy to a distant non-significant entity so the social consciousness can focus inwards and slowly start to improve itself.  

At the end of the day, leaving them to their own devices, and focusing on making sure that the immigrants in our countries are given the opportunity and support needed to succeed and settle in, as well as making sure that they are appropriate defensive steps in place to keep the extremists and terrorists out, is the best strategy. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;but you have yet to touch on the point i'm adamant about. While Christianity has the same horrible things as Islam embedded in it, Islam has had no reformation

That was a central part of my post, so I'm not sure how I didn't touch on that, so let me try again

Due to relative peace and prosperity, and the ability to self rule (christians ruling christians), over centuries, the stability in europe (relatively speaking here) led to increases in education which led to the secularization of the european culture. 

The Muslim world has basically not had that as of yet. The times they did have a semblance of control and rule, they were faced with large wars against foreign players. That prevented them from ever truly stabilizing to the point that their society would no longer have a 'crucible' in the form of a invading foreign religion to continually temper and inflame itself. This has led to religious supremacy and control in the middle east as much as other things.

The reason the muslim world has not had that is largely due to the actions of the european players historically, up until WWII and shortly after. The destabilization of colonial rule coming in, failing, then leaving is almost impossible to quantify, and could take centuries to overcome.

&gt; If the KKK was running around doing this shit, i would be saying the same thing. but they arent. 

But they were at one point. The death penalty, killing "witches", killing gay people. Don't forget slavery was justified using the bible for a long time. 

Pretty much every issue we have with the Koran also exists in the Jewish Tanach, which means it also exists in the Christian Bible. All the barbaric practices in those religion actually come from the semitic cultures those religions grew out of, which is why they are so similar. All the barbaric practices the Muslims have now exist in both Judaism and Christianity historically.

So the question comes down to "Why do the Jews and the Christians not practice these commands while the Muslims do". The answer is that if you go to truly orthodox jewish or christian communities, they still want to follow those commands but they aren't allowed because they exist in a secular society. Russia still jails gay people among many other heinous things due to a strong orthodox christian background. The biggest risk of "sharia" law coming to the US is from the christian right wing constantly attacking separation of church and state and trying to implement their religious ideology as law. The vast majority of society however is not orthodox, largely because of european enlightenment, which applied to the Jews as well due to other historically complex and semi-related events I'm not going into here.

So back to the point. Christians don't "not do this because of Jesus", christians DID this already long after it was formed and Jesus was dead. The reason Christians and Jews don't act like this now is because of a secularization of society due to increasing education/enlightenment caused by peace and prosperity.

The middle east hasn't had decades, let alone centuries of local peace and prosperity, so there has been no increase in education that leads to enlightenment, thus no secularization of their society, thus no reformation.

tl;dr Christians didn't "reform" because of their religion, but because of the secularization of society and an increase in education and knowledge outside the church. The Middle East and much of Muslim Africa has not had the time to reform due to european colonialism, as well as the Muslim vs Christian wars/crusades before that, as well as the fractured nature of the tribal culture they retain that was left behind in europe due to successful conquest. That tribal nature still exists for many Jews and Arabs and is the root of many of the problems we still face along with the historical/geopolitical influences.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; The opinion of sharia law in muslim majority country's is 55% according to pew research. That means that 55% of the people in muslim majority country's support sharia being the standardized law

Well that has to be placed into context, because its very specific to the country, which is also very specific to the local history and geopolitical situation they are in now.

&gt; Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia – including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) – relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.

So to add context countries that have experienced more recent war, destabilization, and major economic issues are more likely to be run by orthodox religious groups. These are areas with little to no education, and those groups often come in power representing the local culture and religion against a foreign enemy that quickly becomes the face of all of the local problems, however accurate that viewpoint is, it quickly entrenches the religious party in power, and often results in harsh attacks on education and media while pushing state religion etc...

Now history teaches us that the majority 'barbaric' practices we currently have issues with were also widespread in Christianity as well. The argument is usually "we don't do that anymore but they do, they're so backwards", but you have to understand why/when christians abandoned those practices and why those conditions haven't happened often in the middle east.

The success of the european powers at colonizing the world for a period of time had a large impact on domestic european life. While there certainly were several large wars in europe, they happened between powers that were increasingly growing more stable and secure in their power and scope of economic activity, and the wars increasingly happened in remote colonies (see the rise of netherlands, spain and portugal as world powers, eventually the french and then the british would come along and take it from them, while still leaving them relatively large and secure as countries in europe). While that is a fairly large oversimplification of several centuries of world history, the point is the average person had increasingly longer and more stable lives. You could live as part of a single country, ruled by a single family, have property ownership across multiple generations (ignoring the occasional swapping of cousins as king/queen), and increasingly those that weren't the upper class had leisure time and money (this was a fairly slow progression for most of the period, with intermittent spikes, but it was still a shift with a clear direction over several hundred years). As mercantilism grew and the business class increasingly took power, education went up, and religious control decreased. The infighting of the church (Church of england breaking off from the catholic church, before that the number of anti-popes etc...) also played a large part, especially when the monarchy increasingly cared less about religion, and would with the right money or political pressure change the national religion of a country. The entire period is somewhat hilariously called "enlightenment", but the end results was due to peace and education an overall secularization of society. The less religious the society, the more difficult it is to convince them to partake in barbaric and questionable religious restrictions that have little benefit or point other than punishing someone for angering "god". This came to a head with the formation of the US with strong separation of church and state laws (we'll get back to that in a minute)

Now go back to the middle east. The ottoman empire was arguably the closest they came historically to forming a unified, peaceful and growing (sunni) muslim society, and that was still plagued by regional/tribal warlords causing rifts and instigating violence, as well as inter-faith conflicts against the conflicting shia muslims farther east. They never reached the level of growth, national unity or progress european christian countries did, largely because the greater stability europe experienced never happened in the middle east. The increasing rise of european colonization in the middle east and africa futher increased the instability, and the controlling and barbaric practices of colonization further entrenched Muslims in their religion. With the fall of the ottoman empire the majority of the arab world has fallen under european control as recently as 90-150 years ago. That control was exploitative, combatative, and religiously repressive. Those actions only further entrenched people in their religion and culture, and further pushed the perception (which was very much true at the time) that this was a christian vs muslim fight for the world.

Now the last 100 years has been the fall of european colonialism, and the clusterfuck left behind culturally, economically and politically. This is on top of a region and culture that has more or less never had the ability to self-rule for any period of peace long enough to encounter enlightenment or secularization of their society. The end result of that is a society ruled by religion, run by controlling information and knowledge, that hardens its resistance against secularization by contrasting itself against the west and using the mistakes and flaws of the west (and a whole lot of propaganda).

A great example of what could have been is Iran. Due to geography, they managed a longer period of peace, and as a society started going through their own renaissance and enlightenment phases. Religious restrictions like alcohol, clothing, language, education were all being relaxed. Then a western country came in, played political games, destabilized the region and then left the orthodox religious who represented the clear "opposite" of the American/Western powers that were fucking with their country, and thus quickly gained popularity and power. Once in power, those religious restrictions came back, and any progress/enlightenment that country had experienced was quickly reversed.

So yes, areas that have been constant hotbeds of unstable fighting, colonialism, the fall of european colonialism, the constant foreign interference and attempts to control their countries and natural resources, are going to be unstable, and that instability is going to lead to various groups fighting for themselves, and when the conflict has been drawn across religious lines for so long, people will harden in their beliefs and refuse to accept or listen to arguments otherwise. These areas worldwide are prone to conflict, terrorism, regional warlords and groups taking power (taliban, isis etc...).

So, back to the question. Is it a Muslim problem? No, its a problem that largely impacts the muslim world today, but the roots of the problem trace back to geopolitical history that isn't specific to their religion but their geography and historical events as well as inter-religious fighting.</div>
