            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/3511624#21295664">Scrapped Python, learning C# for Unity. Is 2 years development a naive estimate for a 40hr game?</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I don’t know what unity is.  But then I am a proud hater of “C pound” and all things micro$oft.  
</p>
<p>But your question applies to most any environment really.  
</p>
<p>Caveat: you do t provide enough info by 10% to even guess at a real answer.  That said here are my thoughts. </p>
<p>First I dislike your “6 months of learning” as being separate from the game development.  Unless you are in a structured instruction program that is organized progression (which it sounds like not the case) then your biggest hurdle will be picking something to write. </p>
<p>That blank screen with a blinking cursor can be quite intimidating to a lot of people.  PLUS if you are just screwing around with interesting looking APIs you will waste A TON of time - probably about 5 months worth.  
</p>
<p>A vastly better idea is to start working on your game.  Accept the fact you don’t know what you are doing and will be throwing away bad code.  But crucially you will be learning the exact skill you need and will learn why things are done AND NOT DONE a certain way.  Things that look great in a 50 line program look like the spawn of Satan in 50,000 lines.  
</p>
<p>The biggest problem in your 6 month timeframe is what is the game going to do?  I can write a game that takes 40 hours to complete in about an hour: the goal is to move your character across the screen but the catch is it only moves one pixel a minute and if you miss clicking by more than 30 seconds you have to start over.   I don’t think that would be a commercial success.  
</p>
<p>It would be good to do some design up front.  You need to know what classes you will need and some vague idea what they are going to do.  Once you get that you can start to say “this will take 3 days; that will take 2 weeks”.  Your biggest mistake will be making gigantic monolithic classes that do WAY THE FUCK too much.  Better to have lots of classes that do one thing well than GamePlay.cpp that is 100,000 lines and takes 2 hours to compile and 5 years to debug.</p></div>

        </small>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I very seriously doubt it.  They may do a free return orbit.  But only a politician would call that “return to the moon”.  
</p>
<p>And since they have already said the main mission goal is to put a warm body with double X chromosomes on the moon we can safely assume the entire undertaking is nothing but a political stunt.  
</p>
<p>I kinda hope she screws up and they die.  Ideally like she blows the hatch while on live TV.  Something to keep the MSM spinning for a month about how it was a design flaw and her sex fully qualified her to be in space.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/3054673#16957079">Is it possible to transfer software to a new computer?</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Programmer's second favorite saying &quot;The wonderful thing about standards is that there are so many of them from which to pick!&quot;</p>
<p>Programmer's favorite saying &quot;It works on my system&quot;.</p>
<p>In answer to your question though -- if we </p>
<ol>
<li>assume you mean a windows computer</li>
<li>HAVE THE ORIGINAL INSTALL MEDIA and any key that came (usually printed) with it</li>
</ol>
<p>Then yes. It is all but certain you can install it on a different computer later.  CPU serial number linking never became a thing at all except at the EXTREME high end.</p>
<p>HOWEVER!  And this is a very big however.  With rarity exceeding even the CPU serial number linking, it is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to MOVE software from one windows based computer to another.</p>
<p>Virtually ALL of the instability, creeping slowness of computers as they age, and just general funkiness is ALL caused by the thrice damned and barely functional &quot;Windows Registry&quot;.  From a computer science viewpoint it is a catastrophically bad design that would   get you FLUNKED OUT of any reputable university.  It sole and entire purpose is to make it technologically all but impossible to pirate software.</p>
<p>So, for the privilege of micro$oft treating you like a felon, you get a slower, less stable computer that gets a little worse every single time you install ANYTHING on it until, unavoidably, it becomes so terrible you go out and buy a new computer.  Whereby M$ gets another $100 and the entire process starts all over again.</p>
<p>Windows 10 has made this entire fiasco 50,000 times worse.  If you ever actually read the license you would have to be insane to actually run this spyware on you computer.  
</p>
<p>Linux is of course the OS most zealots recommend.  But finding and configuring a PC that will run it is beyond the scope of what the average person can do.  The main reason for this is because the Windows license fucks over the manufactures (Dell, Lenovo, etc) WORSE (if that is possible) than the end users.  So don't blame Dell.  It is practically a contract violation for them to even sell a PC that doesn't have windows installed.</p>
<p>Your best bet at present is to buy an Apple computer.  A vast majority of mainstream windows programs are available on Mac and those that aren't have reasonable substitutes.    Of course Macs are VERY expensive. Some of that is justified (the build quality is FAR superior to a PC company), some of it is not ($400 for a memory upgrade that you can get all day long for a PC for $150).</p>
<p>And Apple are not saints of course - except compared to micro$oft.  Then yes.  They are officially guarding the gates to heaven.</p></div>

<p>
I did not see your problem personally.  I looked at an example at w3schools.com and found the difference.  But then I've never been very good at html, so that may not be saying much.
<p>
w3schools.com seems pretty good though.  And stackoverflow is probably the most useful programming site on the entire internet.  Create an account now so you can start earning points and doing more stuff.  They are part of the larger stackexchange group.</p>
<p>Good luck!
