I have a question though. 

How am I supposed to bring attention to what a mod is doing WITHOUT using their name? If I only blamed the subreddits then the issue would be directed towards the wrong place. r/rage, r/WTF, and r/Outoftheloop didn't do this to me, nor did all of their mods. It was only one person. Hence the naming. What else is someone supposed to do to get something done without hurting people who did nothing wrong?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">[This is what they dont't want you to know.](https://reddit.com/r/2020PoliceBrutality/comments/ipmach/without_arresting_the_officers_involved_the_city/)

**#JusticeForDrew**

[48 minutes of bodycam footage.](https://youtu.be/PfDvbTDVpNU) The tazing starts at 28 minutes and goes to 42 minutes. Very NSFL

The city had to be subpoenaed twice before they released this video. Two of the officers involved, Steve Schroeder (Jackson County Chief Deputy) and Brendan Zeimet (Maquoketa Assistant Police Chief), were up for election as Jackson County Sheriff this year. Steve Schroeder is still on the ballot. We're fucked.

Mike Owen is his killer.

https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Report-Expert-says-officer-improperly-deployed-Taser-on-Maquoketa-man--569670031.html

&gt;• Owen and Schroeder arrested Edwards without first conducting a proper investigation to determine if probable cause existed for the arrest. At the time of the arrest, they had not yet inspected the apartment the assault happened in, had not yet obtained a written statement, had not yet obtained a coherent description of what happened, and had not yet determined with any certainty who was the victim and who was the aggressor.

&gt;• Owen and Schroeder decided to arrest Edwards for a minor offense when their training, experience, and department policy demanded that they either issue a non-custodial citation and remove Edwards from the premises or remove Edwards from the premises and later seek a misdemeanor arrest warrant once a proper investigation was completed.

&gt;• Owen improperly deployed his Taser at a time when Edwards was calm, only passively resisting, and threatening no one.

&gt;• Owen’s nearly continuous use of the Taser for 55 seconds (eight trigger pulls) violated every set of standards guiding the law enforcement community’s use of CEWs (conducted electrical weapons) and was thus reckless and excessive under the circumstances.

&gt;• Owen improperly applied his weight to Edwards’ head and neck to restrain him and then maintained that pressure for over 12 minutes, letting up only after Edwards had become unresponsive and was noticeably aspirating.

&gt;• Owen, Schroeder, and Zeimet all played a role in the restraint of Edwards, and all failed to follow their training and correct procedure by providing first aid as soon as possible once it became obvious that Edwards was in distress, Harmening wrote in his report."

https://www.wqad.com/article/news/family-sues-police-for-wrongful-death-after-man-dies-in-police-custody/526-49d35bc9-de71-4fb9-9eff-f49f382483fb

&gt;"You can see in the video, he's not a risk to anybody," Attorney representing Drew Edwards' family, Dave O'Brien said. "He's not threatening anybody, he's just going to walk away. Let him go home. Let him cool down, you can go back later and arrest him. He's not a threat to anyone. He never kicks them, never punches them, never hits them. Never does anything except try to get away from them."

&gt;O'Brien filed a civil suit against the city of Maquoketa, Jackson County and three law officers in October. It names Maquoketa Assistant Police Chief Brendan Zeimet and Jackson County Chief Deputy Sheriff Steve Schroeder as defendants. O'Brien later says he amended the suit, adding Mike Owen as a defendant. O'Brien says he was not told the name of Owen until after he received the body cam footage.

&gt;The city of Maquoketa, Jackson County, Maquoketa Police, and the Jackson County Sheriff's Department declined to comment on the lawsuit to News 8 on January 24th, 2020.

https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Body-camera-footage-released-in-death-of-Maquoketa-man-567282881.html

&gt;The suit alleges the officers knew about his prior hospitalizations and that Zeimet was involved in the two previous incidents.

&gt;“Despite the knowledge of Edwards’ heart condition, Defendant Owen repeatedly tased Edwards using both sets of taser prongs of a double-barrel taser capable of firing two separate set of prongs connected by wire to the taser and allowing two separate sources of electric shock,” the lawsuit states.

&gt;In the video, Owen and Schroeder repeatedly tell Edwards that he is under arrest. He told them, “Why would I go to jail if I didn’t do nothing.”

&gt;Owen then took out his Taser and ordered Edwards multiple times to get on the ground, before deploying his Taser, the video shows.

&gt;Schroeder and Owen had "no reason to believe" that Edwards was a threat to them or anyone else at the time they attempted to place him under arrest and no other officers present said Edwards ever hit, kicked, punched or threatened them in any way, according to the suit.

&gt;Zeimet went “hands-on” and assisted in restraining and handcuffing Edwards when he arrived on the scene, according to the lawsuit.

&gt;“None of Edwards conduct justifies the use of deadly force inflicted upon him in response,” according to the lawsuit. 

https://www.maqnews.com/news/local/justice-for-drew/article\_f2e7ed6e-aff5-11ea-9087-87829e1e9daf.html

&gt;Dr.  Bradley Randall with Dakota Forensic Consulting, who is an expert  witness for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the way Edwards was  restrained likely caused his death. Randall said that the way in which  Edwards was being restrained face-down on the ground by officers for  about 12 minutes caused asphyxiation.

&gt;While  he noted that methamphetamine intoxication and multiple Taser shocks  were contributing factors “… it is my opinion that had Mr. Edwards not  been restrained as he was he would not have died when and where he did.  It is my further opinion that had the law enforcement officers  terminated the restraint, with Mr. Edwards being placed either supine or  on his side, at any point prior to his becoming unresponsive, he most  likely would have lived.”

&gt;The city, county and other defendants have declined to comment on the case citing the pending lawsuit.  

&gt;Edwards’  sister and niece, Brenda Hayward and Janie Fitzpatrick, were at the  demonstration and said the family did not receive any acknowledgment  from law enforcement after Edwards died. 

&gt;“We were hoping to get some kind of condolences, some kind of apology,” Fitzpatrick said. 

Quotes from the video:

Drew Edwards:

&gt;“Why would I go to jail if I didn’t do nothing.”

&gt;Being tazed- "Shower, shower!!"

Mike Owen and Steve Schroeder:

&gt;"46:25 - Body cam officer: I must have been way too high on him.

&gt;Second officer responds: Remember you're live (and points towards himself where his partner's camera is located)"

Brendan Zeimet and Drew Edwards:

&gt;"just remember you are still alive"

&gt;"yea"

Mike Owen:

&gt;"This is probably an excited delirium thing."

&gt;"Drew, you're pissing me off." 

&gt;"You can taze the fuck 100 times and he won't go down."

&gt;"I'm tired of dealing with you."

&gt;"He's still alive, we're good."

Steve Schroeder:

&gt;"He's gonna taze you anyway so you better do it."

At 40:19 you can hear all three officer-overseers laughing at Drew's struggle.

Even worse, the man in the video who called the police is the victim's  brother. You can hear how the officer-overseer keeps trying to push him to press charges but he just pleads with the officer-overseer to take Drew to their parent's house. I protested and met them. THAT would have been the place to take him. Not a jail cell he'd clearly been in and was suffering PTSD from. I wonder too what made him so afraid to even go to that jail for a few hours. Maybe they beat inmates at the Jackson County Jail? Now I'll wonder.</div>

They say this despite the fact that the reason I named /u/ ani625 was because someone asked me about why they had not seen this story. And ani625 is the reason. It is not harassment to call out others for harassing you.

**#JusticeForDrew**

[48 minutes of bodycam footage.](https://youtu.be/PfDvbTDVpNU) The tazing starts at 28 minutes and goes to 42 minutes. Very NSFL

The city had to be subpoenaed twice before they released this video. Two of the officers involved, Steve Schroeder (Jackson County Chief Deputy) and Brendan Zeimet (Maquoketa Assistant Police Chief), were up for election as Jackson County Sheriff this year. Steve Schroeder is still on the ballot. We're fucked.

Mike Owen is his killer.

https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Report-Expert-says-officer-improperly-deployed-Taser-on-Maquoketa-man--569670031.html

&gt;• Owen and Schroeder arrested Edwards without first conducting a proper investigation to determine if probable cause existed for the arrest. At the time of the arrest, they had not yet inspected the apartment the assault happened in, had not yet obtained a written statement, had not yet obtained a coherent description of what happened, and had not yet determined with any certainty who was the victim and who was the aggressor.

&gt;• Owen and Schroeder decided to arrest Edwards for a minor offense when their training, experience, and department policy demanded that they either issue a non-custodial citation and remove Edwards from the premises or remove Edwards from the premises and later seek a misdemeanor arrest warrant once a proper investigation was completed.

&gt;• Owen improperly deployed his Taser at a time when Edwards was calm, only passively resisting, and threatening no one.

&gt;• Owen’s nearly continuous use of the Taser for 55 seconds (eight trigger pulls) violated every set of standards guiding the law enforcement community’s use of CEWs (conducted electrical weapons) and was thus reckless and excessive under the circumstances.

&gt;• Owen improperly applied his weight to Edwards’ head and neck to restrain him and then maintained that pressure for over 12 minutes, letting up only after Edwards had become unresponsive and was noticeably aspirating.

&gt;• Owen, Schroeder, and Zeimet all played a role in the restraint of Edwards, and all failed to follow their training and correct procedure by providing first aid as soon as possible once it became obvious that Edwards was in distress, Harmening wrote in his report."

https://www.wqad.com/article/news/family-sues-police-for-wrongful-death-after-man-dies-in-police-custody/526-49d35bc9-de71-4fb9-9eff-f49f382483fb

&gt;"You can see in the video, he's not a risk to anybody," Attorney representing Drew Edwards' family, Dave O'Brien said. "He's not threatening anybody, he's just going to walk away. Let him go home. Let him cool down, you can go back later and arrest him. He's not a threat to anyone. He never kicks them, never punches them, never hits them. Never does anything except try to get away from them."

&gt;O'Brien filed a civil suit against the city of Maquoketa, Jackson County and three law officers in October. It names Maquoketa Assistant Police Chief Brendan Zeimet and Jackson County Chief Deputy Sheriff Steve Schroeder as defendants. O'Brien later says he amended the suit, adding Mike Owen as a defendant. O'Brien says he was not told the name of Owen until after he received the body cam footage.

&gt;The city of Maquoketa, Jackson County, Maquoketa Police, and the Jackson County Sheriff's Department declined to comment on the lawsuit to News 8 on January 24th, 2020.

https://www.kwqc.com/content/news/Body-camera-footage-released-in-death-of-Maquoketa-man-567282881.html

&gt;The suit alleges the officers knew about his prior hospitalizations and that Zeimet was involved in the two previous incidents.

&gt;“Despite the knowledge of Edwards’ heart condition, Defendant Owen repeatedly tased Edwards using both sets of taser prongs of a double-barrel taser capable of firing two separate set of prongs connected by wire to the taser and allowing two separate sources of electric shock,” the lawsuit states.

&gt;In the video, Owen and Schroeder repeatedly tell Edwards that he is under arrest. He told them, “Why would I go to jail if I didn’t do nothing.”

&gt;Owen then took out his Taser and ordered Edwards multiple times to get on the ground, before deploying his Taser, the video shows.

&gt;Schroeder and Owen had "no reason to believe" that Edwards was a threat to them or anyone else at the time they attempted to place him under arrest and no other officers present said Edwards ever hit, kicked, punched or threatened them in any way, according to the suit.

&gt;Zeimet went “hands-on” and assisted in restraining and handcuffing Edwards when he arrived on the scene, according to the lawsuit.

&gt;“None of Edwards conduct justifies the use of deadly force inflicted upon him in response,” according to the lawsuit. 

https://www.maqnews.com/news/local/justice-for-drew/article\_f2e7ed6e-aff5-11ea-9087-87829e1e9daf.html

&gt;Dr.  Bradley Randall with Dakota Forensic Consulting, who is an expert  witness for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the way Edwards was  restrained likely caused his death. Randall said that the way in which  Edwards was being restrained face-down on the ground by officers for  about 12 minutes caused asphyxiation.

&gt;While  he noted that methamphetamine intoxication and multiple Taser shocks  were contributing factors “… it is my opinion that had Mr. Edwards not  been restrained as he was he would not have died when and where he did.  It is my further opinion that had the law enforcement officers  terminated the restraint, with Mr. Edwards being placed either supine or  on his side, at any point prior to his becoming unresponsive, he most  likely would have lived.”

&gt;The city, county and other defendants have declined to comment on the case citing the pending lawsuit.  

&gt;Edwards’  sister and niece, Brenda Hayward and Janie Fitzpatrick, were at the  demonstration and said the family did not receive any acknowledgment  from law enforcement after Edwards died. 

&gt;“We were hoping to get some kind of condolences, some kind of apology,” Fitzpatrick said. 

Quotes from the video:

Drew Edwards:

&gt;“Why would I go to jail if I didn’t do nothing.”

&gt;Being tazed- "Shower, shower!!"

Mike Owen and Steve Schroeder:

&gt;"46:25 - Body cam officer: I must have been way too high on him.

&gt;Second officer responds: Remember you're live (and points towards himself where his partner's camera is located)"

Brendan Zeimet and Drew Edwards:

&gt;"just remember you are still alive"

&gt;"yea"

Mike Owen:

&gt;"This is probably an excited delirium thing."

&gt;"Drew, you're pissing me off." 

&gt;"You can taze the fuck 100 times and he won't go down."

&gt;"I'm tired of dealing with you."

&gt;"He's still alive, we're good."

Steve Schroeder:

&gt;"He's gonna taze you anyway so you better do it."

At 40:19 you can hear all three officer-overseers laughing at Drew's struggle.

Even worse, the man in the video who called the police is the victim's  brother. You can hear how the officer-overseer keeps trying to push him to press charges but he just pleads with the officer-overseer to take Drew to their parent's house. I protested and met them. THAT would have been the place to take him. Not a jail cell he'd clearly been in and was suffering PTSD from. I wonder too what made him so afraid to even go to that jail for a few hours. Maybe they beat inmates at the Jackson County Jail? Now I'll wonder.</div>
