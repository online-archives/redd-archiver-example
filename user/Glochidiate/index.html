You can be pro or anti immigration but let's not pretend that an immigrant coming here in the 1800's is the same as some student from Saudi Arabia overstaying their student visa. There are different types of immigrants and pretending there isn't is just so dishonest.</div>

Oh boi. I love you AnCaps but we disagree on many topics. I at least believe you guys unlike them AnComs who I think are just authoritarians waiting to get power. At least I don't think AnCaps are going to put me up against the wall so I can appreciate you guys on that level but you guys are a bit crazy. Again, I think you should vote for representatives you like and I won't try to fuck with you, I believe in pluralism and I think AnCaps definitely have an interesting perspective to bring to the table. 

But y'all would think I'm a state cocksucking neo-con over there.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I understand that and I said as much. But in a subreddit called "RedditCensors" I would be hoping there would be a pretty unison "this is wrong" and not "Oh yeah, they have *white nationalists* in that sub? How icky! White people acting as an ethnic block is so in violating of my social norms!"

We live in a time where white nationalists are treated as the fucking boogeyman nonstop and they are constantly censored and oppressed by the mainstream even though their black/hispanic/ect counterparts are left more-or-less alone. It is important to stand firmly in favour of their free speech (obviously not calls to action &amp; shit) because the people who want to censor white nationalists want to censor everyone to the right of Mao. I get I'm being a little bit of an autist on this point but it's so important that I don't like an equivocation of the issue. </div>

This is not an "unbiased" answer in the slightest. "Death" is close to "Birth" which means "Birth of Nation" which means Republicans love the KKK.
