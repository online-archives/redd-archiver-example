<p>But you'll notice that c+= was a joke project, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>False. It's actually a fully-functioning programming language, just one that happens to have a theme/message that goes along with it. In that regard, it's no different than a language like Ruby.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ToleranUX was a joke project,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>False again. It, too, is a fully-functioning project with a message, like above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>webmconverter (popularly &quot;webm for retards&quot;) is back (description is now &quot;webm for bakas&quot;)</p>

<p>So it's been censored. How is that acceptable?</p>

<p>&quot;Ideological&quot; and &quot;libelous&quot; are more accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But they're not &quot;locked in&quot;, necessarily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this Code of Conduct, they are. This will dictate the moderation of every project on their site, essentially the conduct of the company.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct has to be disavowed by every major player that currently partners with it. There is no other win condition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the bullies that convinced them to get rid of their carpet can corrupt them, maybe through calm, rational action, we can fix them.</p>

<p>A boycott is exactly that.</p></div>

<p>That would actually be illegal. It's not abandoned property if you know who owns it and they didn't explicitly tell you they disclaim ownership. You can't just sell somebody else's stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your &quot;Github should allow anything as long as it doesn't receive a DMCA or the repo owner is convicted&quot; is probably bad for Github's business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>False. The exact opposite is true. In fact, that's what we're working on right now, to make it bad for their business to do what they're currently doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I myself am a Marxist, and I disagree with what's being done here in Github's policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably subscribe to classical Marxism, which does not look kindly upon censorship. What GitHub (and the SJW movement, in general) is doing owes to cultural Marxism, a newer and fairly differentiated derivative of Marxism that was founded in the 1950s. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/392rxh/so_is_srs_against_free_speech/cs0wa7t">I talk more about it here.</a> (Trigger warning: reddit link)</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Look. For the last time, the Code of Conduct enables the entryism of incompetent minorities by allowing them to harass, bully, abuse, and threaten competent straight white males. It also enables competent minorities to do the same thing, of course, but such minorities wouldn't need the racist and sexist features of this Code of Conduct to enter the tech sector, already being able to enter it via genuine merit, so they're not covered by the entryism clause. That I have to restate the obvious to presumably smart people so many times is disappointing.</p></div>

It's a license for racism and sexism. Meanwhile, straight white men can be censored and/or cut off from projects for the most imagined slights. It's basically an attempt to cut straight white men off of the developer community and recruit incompetent minorities.</p></div>

So I advise against your recommended solution.</p></div>

<p>One can take the open source codebase and run it on their own hosting without being beholden to GitLab's moderation/censorship. This is what GitGud (as well as many other admins all over the web) are doing.</p>
<p>I do not recommend hosting non-GamerGate-focused projects on GitGud, though. Their resources are relatively limited and they should be allocated to their primary cause.</p></div>
