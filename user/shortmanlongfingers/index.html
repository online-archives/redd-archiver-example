&gt;But they are concentrated, and together with magnitude higher birth rate than the natives. Not integrating is a huge problem. In the short term, none integration leads to poor economic outlook. Poor economic outlook leads to poverty. Poverty breeds resentment, from both the Muslims as well as the French natives who have to support them through subsidies (their tax dollar). Resentment will inflame and add fuel to extremists on both sides. In the long term, with much much MUCH higher birth rate. None integration in a few generations would cause tremendous problem in local politics and then few generations later, strongly influence the country's politics as a whole. Despite the platitudes of apologists, the fact is, there are values Muslims hold, especially muslims from undeveloped countries hold, that are not compatible with western liberal democracies. Just look to the migrant's home country for the best example.</div>
