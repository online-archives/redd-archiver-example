    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It wasn't with that intention. OP was saying they want an "actual woman" in the manner that they have the natural ability to reproduce. You make a good point however, because I know they have the technology to give trans women that ability, as well as how this may exclude bare women, so I'll give you that point. I'm not calling OP rude for his preferences, however I suppose he may want to change his choice of words regarding cis women, and how that reflects on trans women. Thank you for pointing that out.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm gonna take a guess here and say people are considering tranny a slur, since it's mostly used in a derogatory manner. I don't think your ideology was wrong at all. Preference and sexuality is important to respect, which is a big deal when it comes to trans people, so I genuinely hope they didn't ban you for your preference.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Except reporting mods is worthless on this website. Mods are almost always violating the moderator rules with things like this, and it's very clear in the mod guidelines. But reddit's admins couldn't care less about mods breaking rules. The report system has been ignored and pushed out of reach. Reddit admins are useless.

The only time I have ever seen admins take action against people are when politics are involved  and they punish people that they don't agree with, while supporting those who break the rules to push their own political beliefs. Garbage admins only remove what they get paid to remove. ~~This can also tie in to how reddit's administration is being paid my china to remove hk posts and whatnot.~~</div>

&gt;but even the comments that were nice were getting reported over and over for bullshit reasons. If I didn’t nuke the thread, I would have had to lock all the comments anyways

What does that have to do with anything??? Hello?? You're telling us that people were reporting them for wrong reasons. Wouldn't the whole point be to not remove the comments, if the reports were wrong? You've contradicted yourself and proved how insanely ignorant you are, all while trying too hard to seem like the good guy. I hate this platform so much.</div>
