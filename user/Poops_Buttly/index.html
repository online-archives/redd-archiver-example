    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">[Same reason liberals are twisting their hands trying to figure out why "economic anxiety" caused a bunch of poor people to elect the most pro-elite business-president in history.](https://twitter.com/neoliberal_dad/status/827032718559019008?lang=en)
 
Same reason liberals won't talk about class (can't go singling anyone out!) when it would be their #1 issue. Same reason liberals seem obsessed with petty identity issues when class is far and away the biggest intersectionality of oppression and intolerance. Same reason the debate has to be "people are people, universal humanism for all!" vs "fuck that! me first! then my state, then my country!" instead of "hey maybe we can be smart about how we interact with foreigners and outside powers."
 
Ideology's a drug. You're taught that the principal is "all humans are equal and rules should be universal" but that's nonsense. The rules aren't universal. The richer you are, the better the rules are for you. The Muslims don't consider "a woman has the right to choose her sexual partners" to be a universal rule, they see that as a refutation of their beliefs. You can't say that, because then you're causing Muslims racists, so that dooms us to a perpetual violent standoff because we can't have a conversation about how to co-exist with these people that actually addresses any issues between us.
 
Conservatives are ideologically blinded too. "The Government can't tell me what to do, I can own a gun!" when obviously the Government controls everything you do, and also logically background checks make sense and are much less invasive than, say, a SWAT raid for smoking weed, or the Government taking your property at a price they say is fair because they need to build a highway through your yard.
 
Simple principles are easy to sell, so that's why the parties sell those simple paradigmatic stances. They don't actually hold up except ideologically. The real value of the liberal cult of non-control and non-interference is that it let people explore things rationally instead of ideologically. That's why you get smart things like separation of powers and democratic popularity-checks. Free markets work because people get to build their business for their profit instead of the State's.
 
But you can't mobilize people to vote on "I have a random collection of policies I consider smart (because this one is efficient, this one will improve quality of life, this will give people more decisions, etc)", so instead, it's "the things that have been successful so far were successful because they had some god-like inherent property."
 
"Real" liberalism, the purposeful distribution of rights not only to government agents but to individuals, designed to reduce tyranny and increase production by rationally distributing powers so that all interests, including private ones, serve the good and things are fair, is gone. Liberalism in the political science sense, little-l now stands for an ideological position that democracy and the constitution are magic. Likewise, now, on the right, free markets are magic, and on the left, universalism is magic (they're axiomatic truths of the universe). Which means you can't be rational when anything requires a little subtlety, intricacy, or a measured approach.</div>
