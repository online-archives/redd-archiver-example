    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're clearly confused. 

The people in Kenosha were rioting because of Jacob Blake's skin color, that's a fact. After they heard the headlines about a black man being shot they went out and started rioting for several days. They didn't wait for the details, they didn't bother to wait around and learn that he was attempting to kidnap children from a woman who had a restraining order against him who he had just sexually assaulted, and was shot while reaching for a knife in his car. They rioted because of his skin color. That's a fact.

Now we've got that covered, it's not racist to admit that they were rioting simply because of his skin color. Stating facts doesn't make a person racist. Try again.</div>

Again, that wasn't a protest about police brutality, it was a riot that happened for several days because a violent criminal was attempting to kidnap children from a woman who he had sexually assaulted, who had a restraining order against him, and he was shot by police while reaching for a knife in his car. Those degenerates were out there rioting because that violent criminal happened to have black skin, don't be disingenuous and mischaracterize what was happening in Kenosha.</div>

Since we don't live in a perfect world accidents happen, in this case the officer accidentally grabbed her pistol instead of her taser. What you're doing is intentionally misusing inflammatory language to insinuate that this man was intentionally killed by the police when there's no proof of that. It's disingenuous and it's intellectually dishonest.</div>
