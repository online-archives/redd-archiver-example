    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The main character is a terrible person, and we don't see her really learn any lesson for all the bad things she does. Her only character development is deciding that she doesn't want to be a stripper anymore in the middle of the big dance, and the reason for that isn't even explained. The part in the beginning with the muslim women praying and talking about how they all need to be obedient for their husbands felt heavy handed. The movie just sucks and it makes me feel even more that its just a vehicle for the weird child dance scenes. I have a question for you, do you find it strange that the production staff auditioned 650 girls for the part of the main character?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">In my opinion throughout this response you're making a lot of false equivalencies. 

&gt;Something that I came to appreciate throughout the film is that the negative reaction to it is itself a huge problem. People see a still image of 11 year old girls and their reaction is - cover them up, some sick pedophile is getting off on this. Think about that statement in the context of a modern societal viewpoint that women can dress however they want, and it does not give anyone the right to make assumptions about what that woman wants. Wearing a mini skirt does not mean a woman deserves to be sexually assaulted. And the possibility of a man reacting to a woman wearing a bikini top does not mean a woman shouldn't be allowed to wear a bikini top. By complaining about these images of 11 year old girls being in provocative situations, YOU ARE SEXUALIZING THEM.

A still image of an 11 year old girl in a bikini does not at all invoke the response in me that this movie did. I don't believe that I am guilty of sexualizing the girls by being uncomfortable with long sequences of the girls humping the ground, humping each other, sucking their fingers and staring into the camera seductively, gratuitous closeups of the girls backsides and privates, etc. The director is begging the viewer to sexualize them. Where is the line for you here? If the girls were nude would you feel the same way? At some point an image just becomes overtly sexual regardless of the viewers intention, and I think this movie crosses that line repeatedly. 

&gt;In Ender's game - he is 6 years old having a brutal, bloody, naked fight in a bathroom against of bunch of other boys.

&gt;The Sandlot - middle school boys go to the pool and scheme to kiss the lifeguard, shirts off, one of them actually sexually assaults the lifeguard by pretending to drown...

First of all the actor in Ender's Game was 16 when the film was shot. And I think comparing the innocence of a kid trying to steal a kiss from a lifeguard with what goes on in Cuties is ridiculous. I'm sure if Squints was discussing what Wendy Peffercorn's vagina looks like, trying to take pictures of her while she's using the bathroom, and taking pictures of his own dick and posting it online, I would feel different about The Sandlot. I've never watched Good Boys so I won't speak to it, but from what you describe it sounds inappropriate to me as well. 

&gt;This brings me to what this movie really is - it's a coming of age story. Yes, you and me both are uncomfortable with a coming of age story about 11 year old girls. That doesn't mean it's unreasonable.

This is another point I disagree with you on. I like many coming of age movies, including ones with female protagonists (Lady Bird, Blue is the Warmest Color). The difference here is most coming of age movies are about people in their mid to late teens, not 5th graders. These girls in Cuties are not transitioning into adults, they are children, regardless of what their culture says. I'm sure you would agree that just because something is a cultural practice does not make it beyond reproach. The movie itself is a condemnation of many aspects of traditional Muslim culture. 

&gt;tl;dr - sexualized imagery is not the problem with our society. The problem is people refusing to see women as people with the same freedom as men.

I agree with your statement here but I don't see it as relevant to this discussion. I can assure you if that Cuties was about a little boys' dance team I wouldn't feel any different about it. 

Regardless, thanks for the thought out response.</div>
