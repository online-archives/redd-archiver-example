            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/558990#2698818">Nothing is more indicative of a bullshit job than the interview</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Newer programmers these days sound more like children than people who you can trust to do their job proficiently (maybe it's a side effect from all the cutting and pasting they did..or still doing.. while somehow managing to get their degree). I've worked with programmers from all walks of life from your newly minted college grad to your nuclear safety system veterans, what I can tell you is you can always get a bad programmer up to speed so they can meaningfully contribute to the project.  However, you mostly likely will not reform a whiney <code>||</code> entitled programmer (like the author of the article) -- he would likely quit/get axed before you get a chance to make any head way.  Chalk it up to people making &quot;Apps&quot; compared to people making software -- I guess.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the topic of the interview (been on both sides numerous times, more the technical gauge these days).  The questions are there to see how you think and how you act under pressure, because in the real world we have scheduling requirements to meet and that directly translates to someone's college fund, their mortgage, etc.  So you can't blame the team for wanting someone who is a good fit for their project that they might have been working on for the past several years or more.</p>
<p>We have moved away from asking your general run of the mill questions in our interviews -- but always ask at least one data structure question (you can see a sample problem here from my post history <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/420642/1861510">#1</a>).  The link list question is a decent question and here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>It involves a pointer. (Can you tell me why we need pointers in the first place?)</li>
<li>It involves some type of data (can be template).</li>
<li>It involves some mechanism to transverse the elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you solved it recursively, can you do it without recursion?</p>
<p>If you solved it iteratively, can you do it with recursion?</p>
<p>And really the LL can be taken as the basic building block of other data strutures like a stacks, queues, maps, trees, etc.  So when the author says somethign like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have only ever used linked lists for two things: a) computer science exams, and b) interviews by people who passed the former.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know I can't take person very seriously.  Really, what can you possiblely being doing that you can avoid such basic structures as those?  Wonder if Apps makers every asked how their <code>ListView</code> control actually works under the hood?  Or better yet how a x86 processor works?  Because you know, there's a thing call a SP register(s).. that makes everything possible.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Confusing design with algorithms is pretty common for new coders.  Someone has already done the work should never be an excuse for you not to look into it deeper and understand it yourself.  Heck, you might even find a better and faster way of doing it by examining it.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Design</strong>: Change the text color (like the author said)</p>
<p><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;designing in a markup language&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Algorithms</strong>: Write your own <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd162498%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">DrawText function</a> or extended it.</p>
<p>Requirement: DT_VCENTER must work regardless if DT_SINGLELINE is use or not.</p>
<p>This requires you to calculate the height of the container along with the height of the overall text paragraph and position it such that the Y value of Text is vertically center base on the destination rectangle.</p>
<hr />
<p>One you can do by using the IDE designer or GUI (or you can be fancy and edit the code-behind).  The other, requires you to critically think on how to solve the problem as well as use cases like: What should I do if the user resizes the container ........</p>
<p>I've programmed professionally for the past ~20 years (that means they paid me decent amount of money) and math has always been the backbone for everything I do.

<p>Edit: Typed this on mobile.  On desktop now, clarify what I meant.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/420642#1861510">Developers Who Can Build Things from Scratch</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Just 2-cents:</p>
<p>Building from scratch is the norm for us who work on real time system, where everything is measure on the real time clock positive edge or negative edge.  Speaking of my own work, we build system that needs to be operational 40+ years from now so using a 3rd party library that we don't have the source code is usually a bad idea.</p>
<hr />
<p>We even tailor our interview programming question on building from scratch.  For example, given a ATMEL (a microcontroller for all of you that are unfamiliar), write a program that does XYZ (usually transfer data from another component to a SoC) in a certain time requirement.  The program will always take too much time if the person were to use built in libraries (vectors) or in extremely high speed environment even the overhead using looping mechanism will break the time requirement.  So it is up to the person, to read all documentation and timing cycles for said ATMEL and figure out a way to send the data in the delta time provided. </p>
<p>No one in the past 7 years of interviews has ever gotten this correct.  We don't expect them to, it's extremely difficult to go from your regular programming job to a real time system that requires a truck loads of reading before you even start up a single function.  We use this programing problem to gauge how well the applicant communicates back with us and to gauge their ability to read documentation and timing diagrams.</p>
<hr />
<p>If they're not a hardware guy (just your regular run of the mill programmer).  Write a simple plotter.  Given a Vector of Points, plot each point in a line segment style.  Requirements:  Number of Columns, Rows, Delta X In-between Columns, Delta Y In-between Rows all needs to be changeable on the fly, this way the Graph will be truly interactive.  Bonus: plotter will resize if it's parent container is resize.</p>
<p>We give them a primitive drawing library or if they're comfortable with WIN32, they can use the GDI set.   You will be amaze on how many people fail to build this.</p></div>
