    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Your specific argument was that the difference is that it's illegal, not that it causes harm. This is what we call moving the goalposts. I'd also argue evading arrest in and of itself doesn't cause harm but whatever, it's besides the point.


We both agree the officer shouldn't have executed a man for evading arrest, and we both agree said man shouldn't have been evading arrest in the first place. The only place where we disagree is that you seem to think it's appropriate to bring up a dead man's crimes when discussing the unjust nature of his death. 


Have a great day</div>

Like yeah, he shouldn't have resisted arrest. That's bad from him. He deserved to have a longer sentence for resisting arrest. But he didn't get a longer sentence, he got fucking executed, which you agree is not just. 


Also I could easily change the rape analogy to be your daughter was drinking while at a party and she was only 20 and she got raped. There, now it's valid for me to say that if she wasn't breaking the law, she wouldn't have gotten raped. Which is a true statement, but it's still dumb to point it out and detracting from the point that raping is far worse than underage drinking, and executing someone is far worse than resisting arrest.</div>

But also if he didn't go out that day maybe he wouldn't have died. If the cop was moderately competent,  maybe he wouldnt have died.

Like if your daughter/sister/mother went to a party and got raped, it would be correct to say that if she hadn't gone to the party, she probably wouldn't have gotten raped. But its still fucking re*arded to say that in response to someone saying "wow that rapist should go to jail"</div>

Like I agree the media overblows these incidents and that in most cases, the police probably don't execute those resisting arrest. But when it does happen and you justify it with "but he was resisting arrest", you're implying execution is an appropriate response to resisting arrest. Which it is not.


Like you literally acknowledged it's not allowed for police to execute people who are running away, yet you are still justifying this shooting, simply because the left thinks the shooting was wrong. If anyone's brain has been melted by propaganda, it's yours</div>
