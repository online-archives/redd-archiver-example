    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>a simple example would be assuming I don't understand the difference between a java abstract and interface class, and I googled it but most of them were textbook answers that were overly complicated or very vague. People on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/programming">/r/programming</a> would tell you to go to <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> or google and do a copy and paste of the textbook answer. And people on <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> either aren't sure themselves or copy and paste an answer from google. This isn't always the case since it's just an example but does happen a lot of times or are left unanswered.</p>
<p>I'm active but I try not to make a comment unless I have something to contribute or a question for something to keep the quality of comments high, I guess i can try to comment more? since my CCP is ~75 right now so im not that far off. Regarding the fairness question I guess I don't really have an opinion since rules are rules and I'm just trying to contribute to the community since I have so much time from working from home and not everyone has the luxury to do so. But if I had to give an answer I'd say not fair, as I mentioned above I try to make my comments quality over quantity, so I don't think I should get penalized for it. I don't mind not modding(less work for me) if it means other candidates are more qualified and/or has just as much to offer the community, but if everyone thought like that then no one would volunteer to be a mod. Either that or you'd just get left with power hungry people volunteering.</p></div>

<p>I'd recommend <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a> if you decide to go the python route. Python would also be more useful than Java if you want to write some scripts for automation.</p></div>

<li>I personally don't care enough for the rule change since I tend to just ignore those posts / comments anyways and I believe that's what the downvote button is for, but if that's what the community wants then I think its fine.

<li>I work from home and only really go out on weekends for a few hours at a time, mostly an introvert so I'll have plenty of time to mod the subverse. I'm here mostly cause I'm tired of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/programmings">/r/programmings</a> sense of elitism and lack of respect for anyone who has differing opinions which kinda hinders any sort of discussion and information sharing from happening.

basically they brought on someone else and are working on it. You can google source tree windows performance , bugs / freezing issues they are pretty prominent and easy to find. The general consensus is that either use something else or look for an installer for version 1.5.2 which was the last stable version for windows.</p></div>
