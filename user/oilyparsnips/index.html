After he lost an election he cried like a bitch (which isn't the threat - just shameful) and convinced millions of people it was a conspiracy. And the fact that there was no evidence? Or all the evidence he had turned out to be fake? Just more conspiracy. Not to mention sending his mob to "fight like hell" and attempt to stop the electoral college certification.

But people are trying to imprison him because he has *broken numerous laws.*

Can you honestly say you think he hasn't broken the law?</div>

>Is it because they only care about the “gun restrictions” part and gang shootings don’t fit that part of their agenda so……they don’t care?

I don't know any Democrats who aren't concerned about all shootings. Their answer to the problem often is restricting guns. You may see it as political, but it is what they see as the solution to a problem they care very deeply about.

Espousing gun control is their way of showing they care, whether or not you choose to see it that way.

As for bail funds, our Constitution allows for bail, for many reasons. Everyone is entitled to a fair trial and to not be held prisoner without being convicted. The purpose of bail is to make sure someone shows up to trial, not to keep them off the streets. Bail funds meet the spirit of the concept.

Have accused (and eventually proven in court) rapists been released because of bail funds? Yes. But the American justice system recognizes that bail is just.</div>
