I have further evidence. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8eelr3/today_24_april_is_the_armenian_genocide/dxux4pu/) in /r/europe was brigaded recently. Every single comment was downvoted, talking high downvotes. However because it got a lot of attention, the thread blew up and people counter voted the brigading and brought all the comments back. My link highlights a mod and people acknowledging what happened.

EDIT: Someone took a snapshot of what it looked like, before the thread got highly popular.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; Can you link to that thread? 

Sure, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/57owaq/update_downvoting_links_based_on_political/). The mods refrained from addressing the elephant in the room, but around the same time the thread was created there was a huge amount of turkish users posting turkish propaganda videos, downvoting anything kurdish, spreading propaganda. You can also see a question raised by a user with turkish flair, asking the whole issue.

I think you could even PM the mods and nicely ask some history on that thread and why the need to make that clear, or search through the sub comment history and see if you find any mods stating the obvious.

&gt; The best proof I could scrounge due to this lack of disclosure by admins was a trove of info in the posts by a mod of /r/syriancivilwar, /u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, that shows there is heavy Turkish botting activity on after he asked admins to investigate the funny vote games on that sub:

[Here is the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFarLeftSide/comments/62yblc/the_party_parrot_is_now_holding_the_hammer_and/dfpz9xy/) about the 30+ accounts that reddit admins banned, because they were controlled by someone, trying to ruin the YPG flag during the pixel event. This indicates that these suspicious downvotes aren't us being crazy, there is obviously an agenda to warp the view.

I am guessing they have now recreated the number of accounts and I've tracked a few, some were created last year around july to december, a bunch created jan to feb/march. They are acting like normal users, but you can tell.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There was a time when 30+ accounts were banned by admins because they so blatantly used it to spam and remove Kurdish flags during the pixel game that was being held on reddit a while ago. Actually the vote brigading really got quiet after then, but now it's back in force, you can tell.

/r/combatfootage - there is a thread that is ironically specifically talking about turks and their vote-brigading, not mentioning the racist, disgusting comments constantly in that sub they put out. They got rid of all the nasty comments, but obviously the vote-brigading they can only do so much. They sly racist comments and hate is back with a tone of hiding their true nature.

/r/europe is a fest of wannabe European turks who pretend to have western values, act like turkey is some utopia and all the while come up with the vilest shit you can imagine, like pure hatred and racist comments. The vote brigading is there too.

/r/syriancivilwar sub has been fully taken over. It's not even worth mentioning the vile shit they say there. The subject matter brings out the 'best' in them.

I think they are botting, using mass accounts, but it seems like it comes from more of hatred and nationalism then actual government sponsored, however, I may be completely wrong.

Also to add to your last paragraph. They love to impersonate other ethnicities and cultures. They pretend to be Armenians, Kurds, Greeks on a regular basis. It's so obvious that you can tell they are doing it.</div>
