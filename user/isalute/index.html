    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Your dumb ass videos on youtube are amusing to see what a wasted space and shitty PhD thesis produces a subpar d6 nazi perspective driven academic. Guess you weren't alive for the beta test 1939 to 45 as an academic to push along the nazis. 

But your alive now  participating like a pos scholar accessory to the crime. No worries Nuremberg round 2 going to be. 🥳

Sure, your going to deny any involvement your a useful idiot nothing less nothing more. Useful still, hat tip to that. As we look back at your anaemic ass PhD thesis is 💩, I've seen freshmen think and produce better work over a weekend. Don't send me to the gulag now.

Is that gene therapy treatment already spreading, graphene oxide 🤔😂

Stupid fucking monkies, literally cyborg monkies for Gates and co. gimps and bdsm at heart I guess. 

Its unfortunate that they can't keep cryptocurrency at bay for longer cause we are going to have squirters that make it free and climb the ladder of chaos to elitism through coin, quite literally digital coin.

And no I'm not talking BTC or stupid DOGE, but the real utility ones. When the price discovery for those come, you know we going to have flipping retarded as people running around with lambos for every day of the week. 

Unstoppable people and mostly if not all will "happen" to  be people that have not taken the mRNA gene therapy treatment, what are we going to do with them?

They can pay every fine and pay any judge and lobby politicians to rewrite laws or at the very least cause a lot of problems to the monopoly of violence holder ie the gov. 

Then and then ONLy will the fucking plebeians see 2 legs are better than 4. And how they slaved and followed the rules and some shitbag with 10k on a coin is a billionaire. It's going to be glorious, for them. 👑

Oh' the piggies will squeal when they hear the  boar has been killed. 

In the contemporary case 2021 to 2030 

Oh' the boars will squeal when they hear the piggies have been killed.

Read edu bio, look at the Thesis for PhD all you need to know.

My PhD Thesis, entitled "The Role of Online Discussion Forums During a Public Health Emergency", explored how a peer-to-peer forum could be configured to provide high-quality, trusted information during a serious disease outbreak.

Labeling those that inquire and debate science as a apparent antivaxer. Pretty low hanging fruit here, always aiming lower when we thought you couldn't. 

Most people engage and debate, you ban and label people. Real trustworthy, honestly its quite the opposite. You still just a 🐍in the grass.

Time is ticking and time is not on your side, 2022 and all. The game is up and I commend your valiant effort to coerce and manipulate malleable minds many being just minors. 

Unfortunately not those informed that took the time to research the information while following the money trail and noticing the stake holders involved. smh...

Nuremberg 2.0 incoming

At the end of all this, I'll commemorate you with a NFT of your idiotic engagements on defending your gray area tactics of manipulating minors and uneducated masses. smh.. low hanging fruit smh..</div>

Minors can't give consent, unless your one of them people. Nonce, stick with the adults you should read through your comments. You manipulate minors.

Wonder if the parents would be happy after we provide them your public details?

Sorry it's a fact, just as much as minors and young adults not needing the covid-19 gene therapy treatment as the disease is well beneath the threshold for any benefit from this invasive treatment. The documented problems received outweigh the disease itself to the individuals in question. Ethics anyone, don't hold your breath with academics or Dr's remember Nuremberg, the nazis pressed as long as they did because of Academics and Dr's alone. That was the foundation, but relied to much on military coercion, learned from their mistakes I see. 

This twat is nothing more than a cog in the machine, don't even know she being played.

Wouldn't be surprised to see her as a defendant one day for her manipulation of minors to take a novel gene therapy treatment behind their guardians back knowingly withholding information about said treatment by not informing the tech behind it to the minors. Not to mention frontal lobe isn't even fully formed. 

People shooting up treatments as if its random shit at a party. Don't care where it came from, people said it's cool so the person goes ahead without a care. Devilish when done in the medical scene plain stupid when done at a party. However usually dosen't lead to death while the other is Nuremberg 2.0 in the making.</div>

Not to mention didn't they place in DNR's on them as well, during the start of this covid-19 scamdemic, pretty scandalous imo. nazis being nazis eugenics round 2, will we have Nuremberg 2.0 will you be a defendant only time will tell.

Also going over your comments...

Manipulation of minors with out guardianship present to push a experimental gene therapy authorized under emergency clause. No sane educated person would accept it they would pay what ever added expense to refuse it until enough time has passed or new laws created to protect from what was done with this scamdemic. 

ONLY the poor  or poorly informed are FORCED financially or by underhanded manipulation tactics of rudimentary framing for a expected outcome thru raw staging while the others take it due to financial needs of  being excluded by all the markets leaves them where? Rational will tell a basic man that this displays the reality, those with financial means can still have a choice by if one chooses can pay the extra expenses to deny any restriction of ones sovereignty unlike a slave would. Just saying 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

Not saying if you want to recieve it so be it go to town, but to exclude a person from society? They don't have Leprosy acting as if we dont trust the experimental gene therapy shot to offer the protection it states. Jeeze have some faith and live life, pos simps have taken over. really PhD freaks think they run online talk forums, fuck this twat.

The NHS will pay out once a diagnosis is made, being aware and intimately informed of the practices of the NHS to get a diagnosis is as hard as a healthy young adult dying from covid-19 is.

The NHS is ages behind in treatment compared to other developed countries like the one across the pond is. Honestly it might be the influence of medical academics producing fraudulent studies and denying the treatments done elsewhere over those they prefer, wonder if it happens to be because of funding and spending influence. 

They don't deny it, but yet the NHS fights the facts just like you do in your covid-19 rooms of manipulation.</div>

That uses titles and controlled environments to create the wanted reaction from your subjects. You pick out grammar issues rather than taking the time to understand another, you throw your title around as if that dictates respect. We are all strangers online, for all you know I can be a work colleague. 🤫

Your a Nazi, it's ok. Most are found out, most are in academics and you happen to be one of them which also happens to be a wino 🍷 that parrots 🦜 talking points and regurgitated material. 

Why should you feel guilt, never seen a nazi have guilt either. It was just a job after all, cops go to bed soundly just as much as academic murderers do. One uses a firearm to kill another uses published papers. No different, your still a pos simp with a candy PhD nothing significant will be remembered about work besides your racist pov.</div>

This is what the experts are wasting their free time with, reddit 🍖 another reason to show how covid-19 is all a scam the experts are all in on it because we see them on reddit defending their ego's over defeating the pandemic.

You sincerely know nothing of history? Are you truly unable to mark and sight trends, so again your PhD earned how again, really earned... Can't be because of that shitty shitty 💩 thesis. All that you can contribute to society was that pos, stop drinking wine and do real research and study that isn't for the benefit of control. Your a tool, not complex however very rudimentary. 

A simp with a PhD is quite dangerous when you place them in the right environment which typically is a echo chamber self managed however, out here in the open space your nothing but another cow.

p.s 

I don't have to answer anything you inquire of me and vice versa, your a academic trying to pull a card on me 🤔😂 your nothing just another 6 figure 🐒 that will be forgotten in life and in academics your papers will continue being laughed at deep within the forums of reddit, 4chan and the rest.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">A Chinese Communist Party military scientist who got funding from the National Institutes of Health filed a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine in February last year — raising fears the shot was being studied even before the pandemic became public.

Zhou Yusen, a decorated military scientist for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) who worked alongside the Wuhan Institute of Virology as well as US scientists, filed a patent on Feb. 24 2020, according to documents obtained by theAustralian.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theaustralian.com.au/science/us-paid-chinese-peoples-liberation-army-to-engineer-coronavirus/news-story/4adee56c1433fad332a76ffe043390ea

The patent — lodged by the “Institute of Military Medicine, Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA” — was filed just five weeks after China admitted there was human-to-human transmission of the virus, and months before Zhou died under mysterious circumstances, the report noted.

“This is something we have never seen achieved before, raising the question of whether this work may have started much ­earlier,” Prof. Nikolai Petrovsky from Flinders University told the paper.

per your edu background 

I hold a PhD from Royal Holloway, funded under a Reid Scholarship in Health, the Human Body and Behaviour, administered through the School of Biological Sciences and co-supervised by the departments of Computer Science and Geography. My PhD Thesis, entitled "The Role of Online Discussion Forums During a Public Health Emergency", explored how a peer-to-peer forum could be configured to provide high-quality, trusted information during a serious disease outbreak.

You ain't fooling anybody, your a paid shill.

FYI You are aware the non self pollinating crops isn't the way to stop people from starving or lower the cost of crops in developing nations. It's like your a white privilege having PhD shit bag, wait a sec that is what you are. 😉</div>

How did Monsanto get approval of what it is doing to nature by introducing unnatural crops into the eco system, had to get peer review papers to prove and set the narrative for themselves. What better way than to pay pos PhD holders that are shit bags to shore up their defense academically so they can defend themselves in litigation. 

Just an example of what your peer review process is, which is a joke. 

Sounds like your a sellout to the highest bidder and it was the technocrats in this case.</div>

Academics of your stature should think twice about calling a person a troll. Pretty beneath oneself, unless your a troll yourself. Which you are. 😉

Again just another wasted PhD, how much money was wasted on you. However ROI another drone for global narrative push can be considered priceless depending on the funder and goal at hand.</div>

Prion diseases cause dementia what your slowly suffering from hence your parroting like traits 😉

What happened to your addons to your name, add that PhD again so you can feel special inside. lmfao your a academic loser face it. 

I can't say I truly feel sorry for you, but I kinda do. smh. All your life work academically is subpar, stick with your research rather than on social media. I swear these academics are such wasted space, when you see them acting like this. ☝️

Smirky as smile, you related to Bill Gates?

Per your edu background

My undergraduate degree is in Archaeology and Anthropology from Cambridge University (Part II Biological Anthropology). My dissertation was on sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis.

LMFAO undergrad dissertation, weak as shit. wth is this bullshit.

Your PhD thesis is even shittier, they just handing out them PhD's now like candy.

per your edu background

My PhD Thesis, entitled "The Role of Online Discussion Forums During a Public Health Emergency", explored how a peer-to-peer forum could be configured to provide high-quality, trusted information during a serious disease outbreak.

Really, this is what your THESIS was on? 

People are we starting to see a trend with this 🐍 in the grass on social media.

per your edu background

From 2017 I have been the Public Health Policy Advisor to the Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health at Oxford University. 

Sounds like your nothing more than a academic shill. Or a handicapped academic troll due to the misfolds. 🤷🏿‍♂️

How much you getting paid, any consultant work.. shall we investigate this to see if we have any conflicts of interests with you?

Back to your echo chamber, the only place you can survive without threat from the facts of your lies.</div>
