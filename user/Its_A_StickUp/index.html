You can lie to me but you can't lie to yourself that you're actually an idiot and have absolutely no clue how this shit works. You've been brainwashed by whatever cancerous echochamber you chose to participate in. I choose to accept the reality of how fucked everything is and not everything is how its presented in clown world. And somehow you took it as I'm apparently a bootlicker when you don't even know my opinion on police lmao. You're clearly an idiot, no sense in responding to you anymore when all you do is change the topic and assume my position on things I never even commented on. Typical leftist. Thanks for playing, come back when you're actually equipped with a brain that can think logically for 5 minutes.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Haha oh man. Yea I know how it works, I was a criminal justice major. It's funny that you think someone convicted of a crime is somehow racist and they're innocent and just a target of over policing, when in reality, some jurisdictions don't even prosecute low level crime, whereas in other areas it would be prosecuted. Just look at Baltimore City's SA Mosby, she's choosing not to tackle low level crime, and it's getting worse.

I've been in the absolute worst parts of Baltimore City, I've had police officers tell me they don't even bother arresting hard drug offenses because the states attorney won't bother prosecuting it since there is much more violent crime. I literally watched a cop let a person go for possession of heroin, yet a white boy in the county would be sent through the judicial ringer for it.</div>

What about the crime that goes unreported or unprosecuted? Did you ever account for that? And I love how you just dodged a question with a shitty little quip. God you people are too fucking easy. Deflect and shift blame is all you have instead of actually challenging an argument. Fucking moron.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't need to read the stats on when you import the 3rd world you get the room temp IQ that comes with it. Can you give me your thesis on why rape and sexual crimes have skyrocketed when more immigrants were let in? 

&gt; statistics of the ethnicity of all convicted rapists between 2012 - 2017.

&gt;58% of all convicted rapists were born outside of Europe.

&gt;74.5% of all convicted gang rapists were born outside of Europe.

&gt;85% of all convicted assault rapists were born outside of Europe.

Elaborate please.

&gt;  bet you think black Americans perpetrate more crime because they make up a higher percentage of the US prison population too?

I think they commit more crime because they actually commit more crime compared to whites when accounting for population. I'm the sheep? Yet you're the one who has been conditioned and programmed by woke social media and most likely a liberal college. You know how I know you never been in the shittiest parts of the inner city?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh fuck off. It doesn't take a statistician to understand when you import a different culture into another, there's going to be a clash somewhere along the lines. I'm sure Sweden's rape stats have a different explanation as well? It could never be cultural differences with you people, there has to be SOME other explanation where somehow whitey is blamed and the burden of accountability is taken off the perpetrators of crime.

But please tell me more about the increasing sales of ice cream correlates with increasing crime rate to make sure you get in your little correlation does not equal causation example.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Welcome to reddit. This place is a shithole and the only good places are subs where mods aren't complete power tripping morons or aren't paid to construct a narrative in the subreddit.

Just look at the mod lists and general vibe of the userbase before you participate in subs. They don't want debates or discussion that challenges what the mods are told to do, the sub only exists to influence and cultivate a narrative that all these people agree on something from a higher power and accepted it as true and that no one questions it, and if they do, their comment is removed and commenter banned. They don't want the lurker audience to have challenging opinions presented in front of them for them to make up their mind, mods just want the opinion of the subs designed narrative to be clear and present and other comments fawning over and agreeing 100% without question.</div>
