    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">What fuck do you think the US has been doing in the years since Crimea was rolled by an unsuspecting Ukraine?  The war in Ukraine didn’t start in 2022, it stated in 2014 as a Russian proxy war.  Ukraine went from weak bitches who just gave up land without a fight to a nation capable of fighting the full strength of the Russian federation for two years strength in just 8 fucking years, and you bet your ass the US was there every step of the way, including under Trump despite his later deception in withholding weapons to Ukraine and fall towards the Russian sphere of influence.

Trump sanctioned the nord stream 2 pipeline, not nordstream 1.  Even with Biden lifting sanctions as a goodwill gesture, Nordstream 2 never entered operation even till the day it was ultimately destroyed, making your point 100% moot as lifting the sanctions made zero difference, not a single gallon is gas ever did nor ever will go through that pipe.

You lose one election and suddenly you lose all faith in your country and abandon all your fucking values.  What a fucking worthless American you’ve become.  America isn’t weak, we’re the strongest country on earth, you only think we’re weak because you yourself are weak.  Our biggest geopolitical enemy, the biggest nuclear threat in the world, is struggling against that “country we have nothing to do with”, we have some of the largest and most expensive naval loses in the last 80 years, nuclear bombers have been destroyed, thousands of images and videos of irreplaceable and irrecoverable Russian equipment destroyed, intelligence on the capabilities of the military that both Iran and China are founded upon, unlimited weapons testing and data collection.  

It costs us billions, but for Russia it will cost them everything,  they will be nothing more than a Chinese puppet state, they will be weakened beyond repair while the USA and NATO remain nearly completely hands off.  This is the least involved we could possibly be and even that is too much for your pansy ass.  I don’t know about you but I’d rather help Ukraine fight Russia than do it myself and Ukraine is more than happy to as well because it’s either that or slavery.

You are both morally bankrupt and incapable of pragmatism.  You are an American In Name Only.

We were literally the rallying cry, the proof of concept, the ultimate catalyst of the French Revolution.  You make it seem like the French Revolution was a bad thing or that the US is even on the verge of such an event lmao.

That thinking will plunge us into war dumbass, it would make our nation look like fucking pussies on the global stage, our alliances, the very things responsible for this golden age of peace we are fortunate enough to live in, would be shaken to their core, Russian and Chinese propaganda will be so glad to prove to their populace that we’re unreliable and weak.  You’re chumming the water for future hostilities.</div>

As I told the other, being a flawed democracy back when we were a measly 13 colonies, a democracy so flawed only land owners could vote, women couldn’t, and assholes we’re allowed to own other people, did not stop France and Spain from helping us fight the strongest military in the world.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh it’s not just Hamilton that thinks you’re a pussy ass bitch, you should hear what Reagan had to say to pussy ass bitches who thought appeasing the Soviets was a good idea.



“Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy "accommodation." And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer - not an easy answer but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right.

We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, "Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender.

Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face, that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better Red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet." And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.

You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.

You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, "There is a price we will not pay." "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." And this - this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's "peace through strength." Winston Churchill said, "The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals." And he said, "There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty."

You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.

We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.”  -Ronald Reagan October 27 1964</div>

I’m pro-humanity, and both Russia and Hamas are war criminal lead terrorist organizations which wil churn through as many human lives as possible for their goals.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1. Banned political parties?  Are you talking about pro-Russian parties?  It’s fucking wartime against Russia, why would you allow your enemy to fester within your own borders?  That’s like the US allowing a pro-communist movement during the height of the Cold War(we literally shut down entire countries let alone minor political parties), it doesn’t make pragmatic sense, it’s not realistic. I get that you’ve never lived in a country during genuine wartime because you grew up in a privileged golden age of peace, but still you act as if countries don’t radically lock themselves down during times of war.  

2. Banned religions?  You mean personal sanctions against religious leaders accused of aiding the enemy?  Ukrainian law guarantees freedom of religion, so frankly you pulled this point out of your ass.

3.  LGBT record, like that shits gonna get better if Ukraine falls into Russian control.  The only way to improve that is for Ukraine to survive and grow.  If Ukraine fails, that LGBT record only gets worse so your point is completely moot.

4. Tax stealing scam.  Listen bro I honestly doubt you’ve ever had a security clearance in your fucking life so honestly this is just you schizo ranting because you want to seem like your doing this for America’s best interests and not Putins.  

You unironically hate the US and are desperate to plunge us into WW3 by acting weak on a global stage.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Your desire for direct involvement directly contradicts with OPs desire for reduced national debt.  However I can’t say I disagree with your stance on giving more serious support.  I think ultimately it’s a propaganda thing, for example the Abrams tank has such an amazing record, however if one blows up, that image gets spread across the world.  US forces never lost a Abrams in combat I believe, but the photos of the few Abrams that were destroyed while in Saudi Arabian hands are still circulating propaganda channels.

There was a time when the USA was a young deeply flawed democracy facing off against the strongest military in the world, and because of the assistance from foreign Allies the US survived to build itself.  Ukraine is a flawed country, if you watch the Ukrainian president’s TV show that got him elected it’s literally like 35 episodes of him being pissed off and getting constantly screwed over at all the unending corruption in the country he is now the leader of.

Ukraine deserves the chance to become more than the flaws of their roots, and they are paying a lot of blood for that chance.</div>
