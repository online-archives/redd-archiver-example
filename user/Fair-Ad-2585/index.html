So, like the rest of this exchange, it's been you attempting to put words in my mouth, or wantonly accusing me of whatever you want with no justification. I'm sorry you lack the self-awareness to recognize that. It must be difficult, living like that. 


At least to address your points: The justification for separating families, if I remember, was to try and screen for human trafficking. Secondly, even if Trump was entirely pig-headed about immigration and the border, the Democrats poured blood, sweat, and tears into keeping it from happening. So, strange to see that suddenly change?


And uh, I don't know how to tell you this: I didn't vote for Trump. I don't vote. I lived in a blue state, and got really, really tired of listening to people like you. I found him fundementally disgusting from the outset. I thought it was hilarious when he beat Hillary, however, because of how smug and obnoxious a lot of neoliberals were becoming. Then Trump became president and that definitely made it worse.


And well, I don't know how to tell you this--you're never going to win hearts or minds by accusing anyone that's rhetorically taking you to task of being a nazi. Which I kind of figure is a personal favorite of yours.


Which is why I'm blocking you.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So, tell me, considering that Obama deported more people than Trump, and Biden deported more people than Trump--which is now a *good* thing--why was Dronald Drumpf such a evil orange racist for making enforcing immigration and building a border wall a cornerstone of his platform (largely blocked by opposition) such an evil racist move?


Why did he get blamed for putting children in cages (a photo taken from the previous administration), and opposition constantly beat the drum during his administration that "no person is illegal"? Why is a closed border good now?


Is it maybe because it negatively impacts the economy? Do you think that, ineffective vaccines, corruption in fatality reporting during covid, and runaway inflation during the greatest transfer of wealth from the increasingly shrinking middle class to financial corporations, which has left the American public reeling every time they open their wallets, might have something to do with it?



Don't gaslight me, you dork.</div>

Two points: Trump isn't presently in office, dickhead. Also, we're playing catch and release at the border, and that funding was wrapped in a bullshit omnibus bill. Without deportation it's a moot point, and immigration has been an issue for decades. Maybe all the sanctuary cities from Democrat mayors virtue-signaling open borders as a political divide issue to create tension along the lines of race-relations may have had something to do with it?


Now those cities are drowning in migrants, which they cannot afford, drawing hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars that would otherwise be going into infrastructure or social programs for actual Americans, in the middle of a housing crisis partially caused by printing trillions of dollars and handing most of it to banks. Illegal immigration costs half a trillion dollars a year--think we could find a better use for that money (Other than sending it to Ukraine and Israel, which we're doing at a laughable budget deficit)?


You couldn't give me more evidence people with a room-temperature don't deserve to vote if you tried.</div>
