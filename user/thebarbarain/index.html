So, we can tell from a distance there's some mental illness going. We then try our hardest to not be forced to interact with these creatures.</div>

It's the other subs that lean incredibly heavily to one side that's surprising.

And I stand by the fact there are subs that should be shut down because of how awfully biased and aggressive some mods are.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No man, I'm against the far right as well. Can't stand them.

The difference is, the far right is much quieter and less dense than the extremely loud and delusional far left on reddit and all of the major social media platforms.

What's crazy is, those talking points aren't even close to the majority yet they are all we see and hear about. They've done such a good job at cancelling and harassing people most people don't even want to talk out of fear for their livelihood.

To back up that claim - I travel regularly. Talk to everyone. When people learn where I live they make a quick assumption of my politics and so far every single person, out of the thousands in the last couple of years, says they don't like where this country is headed. I can say with confidence over 90% are against the primary arguments the left makes on today and hundreds of lifelong Democrats have told me they turned because of how insane things have gotten.

Could that be because I don't engage with poisonous creatures, i.e. bright hair? Perhaps. 

The thing is, the left is winning the war online and that is end game. Because parents don't "parent" correctly anymore and these kids grow up learning to trust screens.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There are a minority of subs that are very far right. I will agree with you, there. But it is the minority and you know pretty quickly what sub you're in. 

On the other hand, subs that have no political affiliation have been over run with leftist talking points and insanely fast responses to anything that doesn't fit their agenda.

For me, the craziest thing was that my sister is trans. I stated my sister enjoys playing a popular game and a sub of purple hair individuals who repeatedly doxxed people for playing a video game started harassing me and banned me because the mod is indeed extremely mentally ill.</div>
