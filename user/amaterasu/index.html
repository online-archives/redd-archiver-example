        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Removed section:

"Unlawful activities and related support activities are considered off-topic, as are inappropriate advertising, heavy media file trading, proprietary game software modding, warez, porn and various forms of antisocial behaviour,  including (but not limited to)  political, racial, ethnic, religious or gender-related invective."

Replaced with:

"Off topic channels are required to act in **good faith in accordance to the freenode community** as a whole. Unlawful activities and related support activities are considered off-topic, as are inappropriate advertising such as unused channels for the purpose of polluting the channel list results, transmission of illicit content such as warez or illegal content, spam, or squatting a namespace preventing others from utilizing it."

Sounds like "Whatever we feel like should be allowed without stating what that is." Plus, "Physical crime etc, channel misrepresentation, cyber crime, spam, and squatting."

Overall, an improvement to freedom on freenode. Looks like Kim Jong-Un South is targeting a different demographic. Too bad freenode is likely to become an ad and privacy nightmare. Also worth noting, that the previous demographic was people who wanted discussion instead of flame-wars. The old guard was very carful in filtering out anything that might raise the temperature of the chat and making the channels a curated space.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Additional information: 

Most thermal grease doesn't lose it's ability to transfer heat even after drying. However, it thermally expands and contracts like any other material. Over time this can cause the layer to thin, making it lose contact with one or the other of the surfaces. Air seeps into the crack. Air is an abysmal thermal conductor, and is commonly used as a thermal barrier. 

Your thermal grease should be applied thick enough to drive out all air and completely cover the CPU's top surface, but not so thick as to spill over onto the surrounding electronics. Most thermal grease is an excellent electrical conductor. Just a single dot in the center is fine. Watch some videos to get a feel for a proper amount. 

An alternative to applicable liquids is the graphite pad. They are reusable, do not create air bubbles, and do not have to be removed and reapplied if you make a mistake. If you are not confident in your ability to judge amounts or apply without creating air bubbles, the pad is an excellent choice.

Rookie mistakes:

* Do not leave old grease when applying new grease. -> Air Bubbles.

* Do not apply grease to both the CPU **and** heat-sink separately. -> Air Bubbles.

* Do not spread the grease manually. -> Air Bubbles.

* Do not mix grease types. -> Air Bubbles. 

* Do not use large or excessive amounts of grease. -> Spillover -> Fried CPU.

* Do not apply thermal grease to the pins or the pin sockets. -> Fried Chips. [CPU, RAM, GPU, etc]

* Water is not a substitute for thermal grease. -> Water damage. Fried Chips.

* Do not apply grease anywhere except where a heat-sink will sit against a hot surface. -> Short Circuits. Possible Fried Chips.

* Do not forget to clean the surfaces you expect to transfer heat just prior to re-assembly. -> Efficacy Loss. Oil, dirt, and grime collect heat.</div>

A bit expensive, but let's be real, it's about the same price as a tube. You would use the tube once, and never touch it again. 

Also, don't forget to check your heat-sink. Laptop heat-sinks can lose effectiveness and even [stop working entirely](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=laptop+heat+sink+repair&t=ffab&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsnjaEVWHl4M).</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I did not say it was useless. I said it isn't a replacement for HTTP. Competition or associate, perhaps, but not a replacement. It's highly likely to become a commonly used protocol, or evolve into one. 

As far as immutable transfer of data, it seems great. 

As an accessible archive, it seems mostly great, but with the same issues of torrenting. If no one is interested in what you're interested in, you'd have to fall back to HTTP. 

As a twitter? Meh or Blegh.

* Stable release: 3 months ago. Highly likely to include severe security vulnerabilities. A bit premature to say "Let's switch all our critical infrastructure over.

* Poisoned cache attacks work under the assumption of computing a hash collision, or updating a tree to cause a poison update. 

* Updating content requires propagation, which is slow.

* Dynamic content: WIP.

* Who handles data transfer if the page requires a back-end that isn't distributed? Right, you still rely on HTTP for that. 

1) What authority validates the hash table or settles DHT conflicts when CRDT fails? Or do you just lose access to sites?

Centralized networking is not obsolete. HTTPS is still safer, more stable, and in many cases faster. HTTP will not be obsolete for such a long time, it's likely to outlive us by several decades, at least. Unless the web's mainstream content changes to a media HTTP cannot handle. A virtual reality web. Hyper Reality Transfer Protocol... Possibly.</div>
