Well, rabid liberals and neoliberal/centrist propaganda...

Leftists/progressives are often silenced by automod or downvoted into oblivion when they dare criticize corp centrist dems and dem party leadership and elite or even liberal MSM. They often get attacked and accused of being Trump supporters/running interference for Trump and spreading qAnon and Russian disinfo for posting unflattering facts about Biden, Pelosi etc.</div>

I think he had valid points - points which were corroborated by evidence and supported by other journalists.

Not exactly true but it *is* mostly related to Greenwald and Assange, as I said and that isn't against the rules.


&gt;and almost everything you've recently posted there is some sort of greifing. Rule 3 in /r/Journalism

That's not true. Where did I grief? Please link to it because I don't recall ever griefing anyone. I remember responding to people who were attacking me for posting this content or Greenwald etc - both of which is against the rules. 

Edit: Do you think those people got banned for attacking journalists and users? For being uncivil? I doubt it. They likely reported me and the content I was posting to get me and it removed. I mean these users also post false and misleading info (some of which appears to be copypasta) but I don't know that *that* breaks the rules, but the aformentioned behavior and rule breaking is pretty blatant, but mods never seemed to do anything about that. You can go and look through each comment thread of each post I made there and it will corroborate whalt I've said above. The worst thing I ever did there was criticize MSM, as far as my rule breaking goes and I want even aware I couldn't do that at the time.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Not that I disagree with you but I didn't think that sub was the type to ban people for posting content that was critical of media, left or not. Like I said, I had posted stuff related to Greenwald and Assange before and I wasn't banned for it then or told it was not okay. I have also spent time in a number of threads where I've found myself needing to explain my political leaning after being accused of being a Trump supporter or Russian troll. In the end though, they of course don't believe me or they stick to their guns at least that I am a useful idiot who spreads disinformation. I do believe those particular people are hopeless and a disgrace to their progression. I mean the mod who perma banned me is also a disgrace in my personal opinion. I mod a sub and I don't remove people for differences of opinion. If they break the rules, they would not get a perma ban unless it was something serious like threatening violence or being racist etc</div>

Those users I speak of behave like moderate/neoliberal/authoritarian dems. They push centrist and intelligence community narratives/talking points  and attack anyone who questions those narratives. Any inconvenient truths are dismissed as lies and disinformation.</div>
