>What is it you’re getting wrong op?

Posting wrongthink around authoritarians.

What are these mods getting wrong when they selectively enforce rules and ban certain people and not others over political bias? Your thoughts on that?

Edit: I'm also getting it wrong to take your bait and be dragged into another argument where you'll probably say, as usual, that there was no mod abuse and the ban was totally reasonable. That the problem is just me and I've never documented here instances of me actually being on the receiving end of censorship, excessive mod action/mod abuse, except I have, numerous times. And I'm not going to tell you to go away or anything but It is curious why someone who comes off as pro censorship, is doing lurking here and you only seem to discount experiences of the users you don't like or agree with politically, one of those users being myself - who you've followed here from other subs - political subs to be specific. I would say you're getting it wrong with that partisan hackery and this weird obsession/hate boner you have for me. So this time I think I will just toggle my inbox.</div>

How about all the other posts I've made previously? You and I were acquainted long before 4 months ago and when I made posts prior to that but no comments from you despite you saying further back on this thread that I never made any valid cases here of mod abuse or censorship. So those never came up in your feed or are changing your story about all my accounts of events being bullshit and the punishment reasonable and deserved? I don't want you banned, I want you to stop trolling and victim blaming and defending mod abuse and censorship. You are this ardent defender or rules yet here you are violated one yourself. Just knock it off. Oh and your behavior seems to be making it about me more than I am making it about me. I never claimed I was the only victim here and I am not trying to protray myself as a special case. Lots of folks who have posted here have legitimately been the victim of censorship, excessive punishment and unwarranted bans.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Damn dude are you still butt hurt and going on about this? I guess I struck a nerve and the truth hurts. 

Seems I struck a nerve there and who is the butt hurt one? You are the one who always replies to my posts here so obviously they get under your skin (not my intent) and obviously you don't care about mod abuse and censorship and this is just something personal because you don't seem to do this with anyone else here and I have documented cases of mod abuse and censorship which you deny over and over because of partisan hackery and or agenda. It's been pretty clear you dont like me because of my political views and posts and want to discredit me, which is why you go out of your way to try and distort and discount my experiences and frame each incident as deserved, reasonable mod action/punishment and simply consequences of my actions when the story and back and forth with mods, say otherwise. 

You are in a sub about censorship and when it comes to me, you give endless apologia to mods and victim blame. It's not just about me, so why do you only seem to do this with me here? I mean it's fucked up to do this to anyone.

I wouldn't be surprised if you were one of the folks reporting my content in those others subs where we had interactions, helping to result in me being banned. At any rate, you're completely dishonest in each post you make here under mine. I've given numerous examples over at least two dozens posts here (and I've never wanted to or tried to be banned from anywhere, these were all from places I would post to) and you've denied I've ever made any valid documentations of mod abuse and censorship and that is so fucking dishonest is isn't funny. If anyone upvoting you took the time to read through my past posts here, they would see that it is YOU who is full of shit. 

Rule 5 is for fakers, be it those who are outright pro censorship or those who are against it until it comes to someone they don't like.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm not a karma farming bot, but you could be right and I wonder who put that idea into their heads. My guess is bogus reports out hall monitor types but more likely targeted report abuse by those who just want to see a user banned due to their political views and posts.* And mods unfortunately don't have the time or care to talk with the user to see if they are what they're being accused of, they just ban. This is lazy and poor moderation.

*Why would these types also report non political posts, you may ask, because they will report anything and everything they can to get a user punished and shut out from all the main subs the user posts to, l just as punishment. They basically just want you miserable and off the platform. Same types mass report folks on Twitter and or troll them until the person snaps and then they will mass report and get the user banned.  

Anyways, getting back to your initial point, I've been posting to these places over the last 2+ years (and some since I made my account 4 years ago) and sometimes frequently and even when I was posting lots of stuff elsewhere (so like posting a lot in general which I always do and have done) and I was never told then it was not okay. What changed? That is what I'd really like to know but mods have no answer for this and I think it had something to do with targeted report abuse.

And I don't see why a warning or even temporary ban wouldn't have sufficed given the circumstances, If they asked me to post less or not cross-post, I would respect their wishes. Just tell me which rule I supposedly violated, though I guarantee it was not done intentionally, and I will apologize and make an effort not to let it happen again, but instead I am told  there is no chance of getting the ban lifted and told to go outside. 

It's messed up. I enjoyed participating and contributing to these subs. It's not like I wanted to get banned, so there was no ill intent on my part. If it's about reposts, there is obviously confusion there and it is not clear what they consider resposts, is it just any post posted from elsewhere to their sub or content that had already been posted to their sub (which is what I thought the rule was about.) It just was not clear and other subs allow the former but not the latter and that makes sense. If you don't allow either then I guess everyone would need to be OC.</div>

I already addressed this flawed and dishonest talking point from you here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/11kgt65/permanently_banned_from_rautos_without_explanation/jb8s5iu/

Just because a mod removes a post, does not make it a shitty or low quality post. I've had plenty of posts removed despite them being upvoted by the community. And just because a mod considers 1 or 2 posts in a day as 'spam' doesn't make that spam, and at any rate, by their own rules on mademesmile, I did not spam. And as for reposts, I cross-posted and there was no rule against this. Of course if you cross-post or share content from another sub to mademesmile, it is technically a repost and then so isn't the vast majority of the posts there and then they should all be removed and users banned, but usually a repost as I understood by sidebar is if that pic or whatever has already been posted to that sub and if that was even happening at mademesmile on my part, this was not clear to me and I never received a warning. Why if it is such a huge deal would they not just use a bot like other subs do to detect posts that have already been posted there before?

&gt;You are certainly free to take your “quality submissions” to other subs, but then you’ll be back here in a months time after being banned from those subs for “no reason” and “without explanation”. But you have to understand that the moderators of those subs are free to ban you if they don’t like your content or your practices, they don’t owe you anything. 

I don't know why you always defend mod actions when it is me complaining about them. Why is that? You obviously don't care about mods abusing their power or about censorship or at least when someone you don't like or agree with politically is on the receiving end. I have given dozens of examples of overmodedation, poor moderation, outright mod abuse and censorship over my post history to this sub and you turn a blind eye and deny my accounts because you just don't like me and my political views, which you made obvious from our multiple if not numerous interactions on political subs before you seemingly followed me here after I was banned from those subs. Remember accusing me of being a Russian troll spreading Russian and or right wing propaganda? I do. 

I already went over the talking point about being given no explanation. I have to inquire and even then, they don't always give an explanation and often what is given is vague, not clear or does not even add up and I have addressled this and you conveniently ignore that. Yeah, I will just post elsewhere but it's still messed up (but we know you love seeing those you don't like or agree with banned) and I am sure I will still have to deal with hallmonitor types and bad faith reports to get my posts removed and me banned. It's not something you can avoid by just posting elsewhere when people are set on getting your posts removed and you banned. We all know they exist so please don't try to gaslight me or anyone else here about that. If a mod uses excessive punishment or permanently bans me without good reason, I just may post here again, because that is the fucking purpose of this sub. I'm sure you can't wait, but what I find equally sad is people upvoting your pro censorship and mod abuse apologia bullshit. 

 Rule 5 - This sub is open for anyone to participate, but users who do so in bad faith, such as users who themselves engage in or support ideological censorship and then come here to concern troll will not be tolerated.

Iamthemaincharacter? (of course you would accuse me of having a victim complex for pointing out mod abuse and what is likely targeted report abuse). You are straight up disingenuous and antithetical to the mission of this sub.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;&gt;Link spam/karma farming is not welcome. If you’re sharing images/links across multiple subs at a time, you’re likely link spamming. 

I did not spam them. I posted a single picture and the same type and quality of content that I posted at that sub from 2+ years ago to 6 months ago (and content that the community seemed to like) but they didn't get removed and called spam and me accused of link spam/karma farming then, so why now? And spam is traditionally a link trying to sell you something isn't it (?) But these days it is  typically when someone posts the same link or comment many times in a thread, or spams the same post to numerous subs or posts numerous posts to a single sub in a short period of time. At any rate, I didn't post there expecting to get much karma, and I have had the same expectations elsewhere I post, I enjoy posting content I like that I come across to relevant subs. It's a hobby. If I wanted to 'karma farm' I would post to a sub that I would expect to get a lot of karma and just do this. There are users with 30-40+ million karma. Not sure why you have this prejudice against people with a lot of karma, I post a lot, so what. I've been posting a lot for years. There are people who are far better at collecting karma and I would say a number of those post specifically to farm karma, so it's kinda shit of you to put me into that box because I post a lot of content that resonates with me. 


&gt;This reads like an actual description of your entire account. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Sorry, pretty much all you do is link farm. We’re not interested. Thank you. 
&gt;
&gt;Seems like the sub has standards and don’t want your substandard submissions bringing down the quality of the place. Considering it’s their space that is a completely reasonable position to take. 

If you search on that sub you'll see a number of my posts there were upvoted by the community, so that doesn't really align with the narrative you are pushing here. Likewise I have posted good to great quality content elsewhere that receives upvotes but you ignore that also and called it substandard w/e. You just don't like me for whatever reason and are being dishonest, as usual.

&gt;Also, according to their rules they aren’t really big on people earning money from their sub. Considering you are rather likely to be a paid shill for Russian disinformation outlets, an argument could be made that you are also breaching this rule as well.

I don't earn money from posting. Nobody pays me to post and nice mccarthyism. I'm an American btw.

&gt;Seems like once again, and as always, you’re in the wrong but want to blame everyone else. Time to either grow up or get a better job.

Seems like once again, and as often you're in the wrong about me being in the wrong here and want to victim blame and gaslight folks into thinking they're the problem and they deserve being banned for posting content to relevant subs because you have a grudge against those folks due to their political and or foreign policy bias. And it's rich you telling me to grow up considering you hold this grudge and basically follow me around to shit talk me and downplay or outright deny overmoderation and mod abuse because  it's directed at someone you don't like.</div>

Yeah I would not be surprised. Be it a list by powermods, the anti evil operations folks (ironic name since they love censorship - it like an anti hate subreddit acting like a hate subreddit) or admins. I know I have had stuff removed from both democraticsocialism and politics and mods of both told me it wasn't them who did the removing but suggested it was a sitewide algorithm and to speak to an admin. I have also been unsubscribed from subs, though this could be a malfunction of redditisfun app. One mod told me they thought I was mistakenly  caught up by the spam filter (which didn't make much since when only certain comments with presumably keywords, were removed. Another mod suggested (like you) that I was on an list / had a note by my name, be it by mistake or because of what I post politically. After seeing the Twitter files, I am inclined to believe it could be true and done intentionally not because I post often but because of my political and foreign policy stance. While not doubting the possibility of the above, I would say it's likely my removals and bans have more to due with report abuse and arbitrary bans over political bias and less to do with being on a list and or having a flair next to my name, but I could be wrong. It could also be both things. This other user here thinks I deserve it and am imagining mod abuse, how can you seriously look at all the bans I've documented and say I deserved every single one. I wouldn't post about them here if I felt I deserved them and in none of these instances did I intentionally try to get banned.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Nafo and dfou types are all up in threads on the front and subs that frequent the front of reddit. Same with shareblue/MM4A/CAP types. Same with govt trolls. In between the propaganda, gaslighting and disinformation and the downvote brigade, (see boosting/forum sliding and gentlemen's guide to forum spies and astroturf megathread over at r shills sub) they are abusing the report function to get you censored and banned. They even gloat about getting tweets pulled and youtubers demonitized.

The same folks who cheered when people got censored over covering the hunter Biden story (which was wrongly labeled as right wing and Russian disinfo to interfere in an election and the supression of this story was itself election interference and with help of FBI in coordination with big tech in favor of Biden - which is basically that fascism dems fearmonger about for votes), are now outraged when they are censored for doxxing. You see the blatant hypocrisy of liberals. Notice I didn't say leftists because there's many leftists who are anti establishment anti war anti censorship, who were censored the last few years, ramping up since 2016 and even moreso before the 2020 election. 

Anyways, I believe a number of subs may be compromised at mod level by smear agents/political operatives w.e (CTR/shareblue has been caught doing this) but many mods just give in to bogus reports for free whether it's that they are lazy or more likely it suits their political bias which is molded by the aforementioned social media manipulation campaign out the govt/MIC/big pharma/political think tanks. And let's not forget it isn't just mods or power mods specifically but I'm pretty sure the director of policy used to work for Atlantic Council who has ties to NATO and CIA, so there's also that.

We know the Hillary-DNC-MSM collusion, which also included FBI and big tech collusion and we know the govt leanes on and works with big tech and over at Facebook and Twitter (who censor at the behest of them and Biden's people and now the WH) and they seemed all to happy to help censor, if anyone thinks the same thing isn't happening here on Reddit just as bad if not worse, I have a bridge to sell them!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Hard to not be bothered by or to take it personally when I have been banned off so many subs and a number of them I posted to many times and even frequently. I think it would bug you too and you don't have to be in the same situation to see people are targeted by bogus reports, be it out bad faith actors looking to get people censored or banned or angry hall monitor types and mods also inconsistently enforce rules and arbitrary ban over the smallest of things based on political bias or incorrectly assuming a users identity or intent with one look at their profile. 

They just side with these bogus reports because that is the easy thing to do or they have an agenda. But they mod for free and it's time consuming (!) (many users post for free and contribute to these subs which promotes engagement, people coming back and helps grow the community) but then they put more energy into defending this behavior/poor moderation (if they even reply) than they do hearing out the users side of the story, even if a mod is mistaken with their assumptions and reasoning behind a perma ban. They don't care to discuss it or argue as they say, and will only double down if you try to explain it was an honest mistake and misunderstanding. Shameful moderation.

And just because it's not the 'real world' or 'relatively important' (though it arguable is in manipulating discourse and narratives/perspectives surrounding politics to manufacture consent, shield the corrupt and smear their critics) doesn't mean this crap shouldn't be called out, because if it isn't a post to screenrant over a show, it is a political opinion and that suppresses healthy debate, something even you ought to care about. Someone who doesn't put time and energy and enjoyment into posting, probably wouldn't mind being banned as much as someone who does, I get that.

I know you're wondering why is this person ranting and giving me a wall of text. Do they always do this. Yes I do it often. You can see I'm passionate about documenting and exposing censorship and mod abuse and it's something I have been doing for years. I think it's a serious topic and it's a harmful part of social media and harmful to online society and  discourse. I believe in general, it promotes other mods to behave in a similar authoritarian fashion and it promotes echo chamber and division, when what we need right now more than ever especially on the politics front, is open information, healthy debate and class solidarity.</div>

So I should just not care or complain when  banned over such a minor thing? Isn't that the purpose of this sub, to document this type of stuff. Not to give apologia to mod abuse, suggest people deserved it and then tell them they take reddit too seriously for making a post about mod abuse in a sub specifically about that thing. You don't have to enjoy posting/sharing content to see that is it uncool to just ban people for so little off subs they have posted to previously and would like to continue posting to. My post bugging you more than the mods ridiculous reasoning to defend the ban, speaks volumes. What I can't understand is why you are being upvoted for it.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Then they should have just said don't post screenrant and I would have apologized and not posted it in the future. You think the ban was appropriate? You know mods can blacklist certain sites if they don't want it posted, right? Disallowed domains.  At the very least mention it in their sidebar but I don't see anything there about not posting screenrant.

Edit: Also, people share stuff from one site or sub to another all the time without claiming to be the creator of said content or pretending they are when they aren't. Much of the content you see and upvote is probably not OC by that user, it is someone else's content, shared from somewhere else and or it has already been posted here or elsewhere on the internet (i.e. repost), so I am not sure what your point there is. Whether you like the content or not is irrelevant to the discussion. This sub is supposed to be about documenting censorship and mod abuse so I always find it odd whenever a user here appears to defend a mods excessive force and are upvoted while the user documenting it, is downvoted. I am against this crap happening to anyone, regardless of their political leanings. Why am I getting the   impression that the feeling is not mutual? Or maybe it has nothing to do with that and you are just pro censorship and giving apologia for mod abuse, but then why are you posting here?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Point taken, but does my 'high-karma' mean my post is automatically spam? No. So you should consider people may get the wrong impression, don't you agree? I think it happens a lot. Do you care if they jump to the wrong conclusions and ban someone over it? This is not the first time I have experienced this. Mostly it is probably triggered by bogus reports and mods give in to them, maybe a quick glance at your profile, pass judgement and they don't care to hear your side or the mod has a political agenda and arbitrarily enforces rules based on their political bias. Basically neither wants to admit if and when they wrongly ban you or were too extreme with the punishment. It doesn't matter how polite and good faith you are.

Did you know there are plenty of other users with more karma than me i.e. users with 5/10/20/30/40 million karma. Do you think mods should have prejudice over people with higher karma and just assume they are trolls, bots or spammers? The meaning of spam varies from person to person. I see my participation as engagement and contribution of content I enjoy and or care about. When I think spammer, I think someone spamming a certain link over many subs or spamming a single sub with many links in a short period of time. Not necessarily someone who posts a bunch of times a day. At any rate, I don't think mods should discriminate but either way, the debate here is: was the post 'spam' and did posting it warrant a perma ban.


Edit: The mod I spoke to said: "We consider link dropping / Fly-By posting to be low effort and find that those types of post don't add value to the community. Hence spam"

So if I don't post there for a while and then I post a link to screenrant for example or some other site containing an article about the show, that is 'low effort' in their eyes (but it is not low effort if someone shares a pic or meme or a youtube video about the show, apparently) and it is assumed it adds nothing of value to the community (how can a mod know this without looking at the content and it seems rather subjective. Obviously if it is a repost then it adds nothing new but the poster doesn’t necessarily know it is a repost), and is therefor spam (except is that what spam is?). I posted there during s5 of the show, out of nowhere, and I wasn't accused of spamming or low effort and my  participation then was 'active and meaningful' but not now? I would have liked to participate there more as I watch the new season but now I can't.</div>

I wouldn't even say lazy moderation but abuse. Like they don't have the time to manage exceptions but they have the time to give the long reply they did to defend the ban? They quoted moddiquette after I brought it up in regards to appeals. You would think part of it and their job is willing to hear people out. I thought this was assumed under the take appeals seriously part but maybe I misunderstood. Maybe appeals is not the same as contesting/disputing. Maybe they aren't expected to respect the latter, only the former after a user has agreed they broke the rules and that the punishment was warranted?</div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Please see my reply to their comment here before you praise them too much. They did not lift my ban despite them allowing others who do worse, from personal attacks to inciting brigade, to continue posting there, as their posting aligns with the narratives that are pushed and embraced there (you can take a guess which) and gives the sub it's purpose/reason to continue. 

The Russians aren't the only ones engaging in "active measures" and I notice some narratives or assertions there are not just propaganda but actual lies/disinformation and if I were to provide countervailing evidence to debunk a talking point as such, I would be called directly or indirectly a Russian troll or Kremlin propagandist, be downvoted and liable to have my comment removed. That is accepted there and I took it for a long while, but when I finally bite back in the slightest way, that is enough reason to uphold a ban after this mod admitted yet again I was wrongly banned with the false accusation of being a 'Russian troll.' 

So a mod (who violated the subs own mission statement and rules) was removed as mod but was allowed to continue posting there, and this other mod is now unbanning this user above in this thread to save face, just as with removing that other mod, but I think the latter is more of a move to avoid conflict of interest and culpability and for plausible deniability. If they were genuine about being fair and rectifying the issue, they would be consistent and lift my ban or ban all these other users as well and I would ask why they hadn't already been doing that all along if they even stick to their rules rather than just enforcing them selectively and arbitrarily with bias.

You're absolutely right about Shareblue not to mention MM4A, CAP and other like-minded neolib/neocon pro war, imperialism, military industrial complex, security state apparatus, MSM, big pharma groups/think tanks having a bigger troll/astroturf presence and influence on Reddit (and other social media platforms - to manipulate perception, control the narrative and discourse) then anything the Russians are doing. But users here will have you believe Russian trolls are everywhere and all powerful to sway elections in the U.S. and in the minds of every individual who would dare criticize the dem party, their elected official or push for third parties, while simultaneously pretending there is never any propaganda or disinformation coming out authoritative MSM and denying the existence of liberal establishment/US or US backed trolls/astroturf on Reddit and other social media.

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I updated my post here after I last spoke to an activemeasures mod, when I was not able to dispute the justification for upholding the permanent ban, because the mod did not unmute me so I could reply but instead extended my mute from 3 days to 28 days. Please read my response here and explain given the circumstances how those two comments of mine warrant a permanent ban. 

I saw regular users say worse to me than what I said in those 2 comments and without any consequence, as they continued to post and this was my experience each time I have posted there over the last year or so. That including uncivil comments made by that mod (who is no longer mod as you say) but is seemingly still allowed to post there. Both comments you use as justification to uphold the ban, had not been removed previously but what *was* removed were civil comments where I politely defended myself against troll accusations and provide evidence to back up my claims. How many posts and civil comments of mine were removed since I first posted there, I wonder. Did these other users who treated anyone with an alternate take as a Russian troll, get the same treatment, even when they made uncivil comments? Sure never seemed like it. Does that sound remotely balanced to you?

If you disregard my previously ban, as you should since it was unwarranted / based on false accusation (that was confirmed in the message I got like a year ago when it was lifted), I have not violated any rules since then that I recall, until these 2 recent comments you can point to and say are slightly uncivil. Would that not warrant a warning or temporary ban at most? I also never brigaded your sub, I merely documented folks from your sub smearing wotb and by your own definition, inciting a brigade upon wotb and or even individual wotb users. 

Furthermore, on top of being called names and being on the receiving end of innuendo to discredit me / attack my character, I was almost always downvoted despite taking the time on numerous occasions to debate in good faith. I am glad you uplifted this other person's ban, but think given the treatment I have received by this other mod and by users there, and given the inconsistency in rule enforcement, it is kinda unfair to uphold a perma ban against me.</div>

Not any moreso than the majority of posts on this sub and that is the title it gave me when sharing the article to reddit.


&gt;If you had actually read and understood the article, you would know that (1) it's just some random website that lists people they don't like, (2) the article itself calls everything rumors, (3) the article itself calls those rumors "debunked", "baseless", or on "shak[y] grounds".

I have read it along with these two articles covering the same topic and I suggest you do as well. I don't think you read the article  or you did and are just being dishonest about what it covers and is saying - it is saying there is truth to this and enough to warrant genuine concern and you just outright dismiss it, I wonder why that is.</div>

I am using the redditisfun app and I don't see any rule in the sidebar of upliftingnews against political posts. Plus I see other posts in that sub that are political in nature and are still up. Can you explain this? Your argument is that my post was removed for being political... not bogus reports that abuse automod to censor or biased mods/admins removing content arbitrarily?

https://np.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/vt0lul/a_law_criminalising_samesex_acts_between

I am not against same sex marriage btw.

And I have a bone to pick with that sort of rule anyways (no politics) because what is and isn't political, exactly, how is it not subjective? Many things revolve around or involve politics. This seems like a rule that may be used to suppress information and control the conversation while under the guise of preventing drama, you are in reality preventing healthy debate and enlightenment.

I see in there sidebar they list under friends of upliftingnews! Joe Rogan of all people - who you apparently don't like and shit talk and smear. Claiming he is crazy/a moron/a joke/bad/100% a conservative/a Trumpist, despite him saying he liked Bernie's policy and said he would vote for him.

https://np.reddit.com/r/LibertarianUncensored/comments/w8xwao/joe_reviews_tiktoks_crazy_terms_of_service/ihttnu0

AFAIK Rogan is an admitted liberal (appears to the left of moderate corporate-centrist dems - who are actually right-wing) and he is what I imagine a traditional liberal looks like, not like today's 'liberal' e.g. neolib/neocon democrats like Biden or Hillary - who consider themselves liberals.

Those links provide evidence that challenge the claims you made about Rogan.

The purpose of THIS sub is to document censorship and that is precisely what I have done. Why would someone who is seemingly pro-censorship, be hanging out in an anti-censorship sub? Can you answer that?

Edit: and here is you advocating for imperialism:

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">New to Reddit? Not at all. Classic liberals are like what Joe Rogan is. Todays liberals are neolibs and neocon dems who are fake leftists and leftists (shit/radlibs) who parrot the former's propaganda - enabling class division and division among even the left and who run interference for their own leaders even when they do not fight for what they ran on because... Republicans/Trump. This site is like one big liberal establishment (neolib/neocon dem) propaganda board and when I say that I am not saying it is leftist, though I would argue most of the users are in fact leftists.

I remember when the politics and political humor sub was upvoting stuff critical of Hillary and the democratic party (even Obama) and stuff favoring Tulsi, Nader even Ron and Rand Paul. I think it started or really ramped up (in terms of astroturf, paid for likes/votes/reports and censorship) in 2015/2016 and has been getting worse ever since.</div>

And the dem party used/manipulated BLM to a attack Bernie in 2015/2016 and then tossed them out recently when it was convenient i.e. when BLM was promoting defund the police (really just reallocating excessive funding from police to other sectors that could really use that money), oh and leaders of the BLM movement sold out.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Liberals are mainstream leftists (aka milquetoast/boutique/limousine left aka cia or synthetic left) who are more like center center-left with caring more about a cultural war than a class war and parrot pro dem establishment, pro imperialism, pro security state, pro partisan anti class solidarity propagandistic talking points, helping to run interference for neolibs and smear the critics of those grifting democrats. Leftists who dare criticize the dem party from the left and seek to hold their leaders (even progressives leaders accountable and to what they ran on.) These 'leftists' tend to be pro censorship, cancel culture, push pro military industrial complex and security state propaganda and smears of critics on the left unwittingly. It's also a label worn by neolibs and neocon democrats who pretend to be leftist. They have co-opted the word 'liberal.' Some of the same folks even go as far to call themselves progressive, like Hillary, Biden, Pelosi and Clyburn. 

Leftists often refer to the former as neolibs or shit and radlibs (not to be confused with the right-wing term 'libtard'), and those democrats as corporate centrists and dinos. The liberal establishment - dem party, liberal MSM, is not leftist or pro working class. Neither is Bernie's socialism this scary thing that both parties want you and I to believe, both dem and rep voters are for Bernie's populist working class policy. Our own govt has targeted leftists and working class activists for decades and saw to stopping 'socialism' in countries that did not fall in line, so then they could point to failures caused by their sabotage as evidence of this scary 'socialism' failing, when the socialism Bernie has promoted is alive and well in other capitalist nations and see their happiness index compared with America.</div>

More like shit and radlibs (who are more like centrists with their apologia and smears of leftists) under neolib and neocon (pro war/imperialism/censorship) leadership, pressured by an authoritarian govt/security state to censor and the FBI and others have targeted both working class and progressives/leftists for decades btw. Many leftists who are critical of the former for being unwitting tools of the latter (or for having dissenting/unpopular takes on Russiagate, covid, Trucker protests, Ukraine, cancel culture or  for criticizing MSM, the security state, the military industrial complex and corporate centrist dems and the dem party) are censored just as you right wingers are. See occupy wall street and BLM being targeted, see astroturf, agent prevacateurs, cointelpro and MLK, Fred Hampton, Malcolm X. You know, folks who wanted actual class solidarity not division among party lines. It's plausible there are some compromised (on the job) mods, even admins, but most just censor and toe the status quo line for free, which is alarming but the groupthink and self censorship is real. Do you see how fast people supposedly on your own side, will turn on you if you question official narratives out your leadership / power centers and seek to hold them accountable?</div>

Canada also removed it, just like they removed my previous post (Matt Taibbi op-ed) that was critical of Trudeau. So I guess if you are pro trucker convoy protest or critical of Trudeau, they think you are trolling and will censor and or ban you. Any opposing views are trolling, because it couldn't possible be to enlighten others and or engage in healthy debate. Banned in 10 minutes and I wrote this long reply to the first user who responded to me (telling me I must have an illness and to get help) and I could not even send it. Yeah, really great bunch of people there modding those subs. No, they bring shame to all Canadians.</div>

Hell, the head of the imaginary network sub has 16 million karma and says they only post between 1-2 hours per day in the morning while watching Youtube videos and drinking coffee. It is not terribly hard to collect karma these days.

Look, found a leaderboard https://www.karmalb.com/</div>

Yawn. Haven't heard that one before. You are projecting.

It discredits people on both sides with common class issues as the extremes and fringe, when the extremists are in fact the ones in the middle who reject popular policy and that goes for leadership of both parties btw. The whole red-brown alliance and pipeline* talking points for instance is neolib propaganda you see pushed by pro-corp dem, pro-war/imperilism, pro-censorship dems.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;You post shitty far-left propaganda all day. Most of it blatantly wrong.

Incorrect.

&gt;You’re the least credible person to be saying that

Posts to the majority report, howard stern and neoliberal. 

Says shit like:

"You’re stereotypical of the type of people that follow Krystal and Saagar. The common theme being nasty aggressive partisans from MAGA world and Bernie Brodom who differ on policy but share a vitriolic temperament." 

And:

"For someone who reacts to a linked WaPo article with derision it’s not lost on me the irony you’re linking to literal state propaganda channel Russia Today as if it’s credible."

As if MSM in America isn't essentially state TV lol

And defending YouTube removing dislikes:

"There’s a big difference between downvoting clickbait videos or a technical video that is incorrect vs pulling up a news video of a politician and it’s got more downvotes than votes and all the politician said in the video was “God bless America.” It becomes obvious the videos are being downvoted by people that simply don’t like the subject (in this case a politician) rather than an honest judgement on the content of video itself. Worse, it’s not a 1:1 ratio of person to downvote. Bots and fake accounts spam the dislikes to artificially inflate them. This has been a problem for years and I’m actually glad it’s been done away with. There’s a reason out of all the social media platforms only Reddit uses downvotes. It’s usually toxic."

And saying stuff like this:

"I’m very familiar with January 6th. There is no coverup or framing. This is typical right-wing conspiracy nonsense in an attempt to shirk responsibility for what conservatives did that day. Even if there were FBI agents working up the crowd nobody made Trump supporters break in the Capitol and commit various illegal acts. If anything, you’re admitting conservatives are easily duped which isn’t very flattering to say the least."

And linking propaganda out WaPo.

I think you are hardly one to talk and you only think I'm 'far-left' because you probably aren't even a leftist.</div>

&gt;
&gt;No it is not! You are in completely denial what you have wrote:
&gt;
&gt;**What does it matter if someone else decides they don't want to get the vaccine? You can get it from someone who is vaccinated.**

I am saying to those calling people plague rats and afraid of catching it, to those who want to mandate vaccines, what does it matter to you if someone else decides they don't want to get the vaccine? If you are worried about covid, get vaccinated. I don't know why you are intepreting my statment the way you are, maybe because you are trained to see it this way? In any case, my statement was not misinformation.


&gt;**You can't interpret that statement in a different way other than saying that the transmission rate is the same for unvaccinated and vaccinated people.** Which is false! The reality is it **does** matter! Therefore it is misinformation.

Yes, you can and I never said what you are saying I said. You jumped to conclusions and assume I am saying that the vaccine makes no difference in transmission, but I simply stated a fact. I should have said, it reduced but does not stop but the fact of the matter is that it does not stop you from getting or giving it, which is the crux of my point.

It is misleading to say or suggest that people who are vaccinated cannot get or pass covid or that you can't get sick if you are vaccinated. I have seen MSM, Maddow, Biden, and people across reddit spread those falsehoods and I did not see that censored and called dangerous misinformation.</div>

I am saying people should have a right to decide if they want to get it or not and that you can catch covid from vaccinated people and even if you are vaccinated. That is all I was saying. So to those calling others things like 'plague rats' just realize how divisive it is and at the same time, ridiculous. The whole concept of that suggests that if just everyone got it, we would be rid of the virus and it suggests the only people spreading it are the unvaxxed. *That* is misleading.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;You do, repeatedly

I don't think so, but let's address what you perceive as misinformation. 

&gt;The official line is to take the vaccine not to take vitamins.

&gt;https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-vitamin-d-zinc-and-other-supplements-help-prevent-covid-19-or-hasten-healing-2021040522310

&gt;"The researchers found that people receiving the supplements, whether individually or combined, had no improvement in symptoms or a faster recovery when compared with otherwise similar patients receiving neither supplement

Nowhere did I ever say you should do these things instead of take the vaccine. I questioned why these things weren't suggested to be done in addition to use of a vaccine.

https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/supplements/

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750357/

"Several minerals and vitamins have antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial roles which could be helpful for the immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the absence of a widely available treatment or a vaccine for COVID-19, supplementation of micronutrients emerges as an important measure to improve the immune system and to prevent the development of severe symptoms."

&gt;May help doesn't mean anything. Eating bananas and riding on a bicycle may also help. If there is no evidence that it helps there is no good reason to portray it as something good.

I said may help and that is what the study shows. Again, no misinformation there. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987002/

&gt;**We would eradicate the harm the virus does to us** and reduce cases with lower transmission rates. 

How is this not misinformation? Even if everyone was vaccinated, it would not go away and people can still get sick and go to the hospital with it. What was was incorrect in the sentence of mine that you quoted?

&gt;Less people severely sick &gt; less people on ICU's &gt; greater chance to avoid overburdened hospitals.

Yes and yet hospitals were overburdered pre-covid and also, we are 2 years in. If we lack ICU beds and are still overburdered, again, this speaks to our broken healthcare system. Do I think less hospitals would be overburdened if everyone was vaccinated, probably, but I don't think neccesarily that hospitals wouldn't still get overburdered.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Reading through other comments you made here on Reddit, you really should have been banned a lot sooner. You are spreading misinformation, bashing on vaccines and at the same time you talk about how taking vitamins or CBD oil could help against covid. Overfilled ICU's mainly because of of unvaccinated people? Not for you, because you think it's just a lacking ICU bed issue.

1) I'm not spreading misinformation but I see a lot of people who do and are upvoted. My guess is you have no concern about that because what they say fits your agenda/bias 2) uh, I'm pretty sure the offical line is that taking such vitamins can help. I think by now this is undisputable 3) there is a study showing that CBD may actually help, that was also not a lie. 4) my issues is people pushing the narrative that if just everyone got vaccinated, we would eradicate the virus and our hospitals would not be overburdened. It would eradicate the virus and I am disputing that and hospitals couldn't be overburdered anyways (as they were the year before the pandemic) because of the for-profit healthcare system, which brought me to that point of the underlying issue, which people seem to ignore/be distracted from when they are just told it would be all good and not happen if only evergone was vaccinated. That is misleading, no?

&gt;People like you don't realize that spreading such bs over the internet might make people not take the vaccine and they could get seriously ill or dead because of that, if they get infected with covid.

You haven't read that far into my post history then because I am vaccinated, I have said how it helps and have advocated for people to get vaccinated if they are worried about getting seriously ill from covid. I have said I am against forcing people to take vaccines. So fucking what. 

It's nice of you to ignore misinformation (and potentially dangerous misinformation) out official sources though.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;&gt; It's really not and our overburdened hospitals speaks more to for profit healthcare system. Hospitals have closed. Staff have been cut. They admitted ICU beds are not profitable, that is why we don't have more.
&gt;
&gt;I don't have time to respond to anything else right now, but this take is kind of silly. Yes, America's healthcare coverage has serious problems, but ICU capacity (equipment and trained staff) never ever scales well. It requires too much time, commitment and people to get capacity of that level ready to be able to scale well. Especially when it comes to pandemics. No matter what you do, you will never have enough ICU capacity to cover what you're really going to need for a pandemic like this one.

Yeah, my argument is those using this ICU argument should really look deeper into the problem, not just on the surface level of covid patients, but why we lack ICU beds, why hospitals have closed and staff have been cut.

&gt;Vaccinations scale infinitely better. And being vaccinated relatively/statistically keeps you out of the ICU (and hospitals). This is a measured fact around the world. So yes, being unvaccinated is a huge part of the problem of hospitals/ICU's being overwhelmed right now. There's no question about that.

I never argued otherwise.</div>

I know the conspiracy sub is infested by trolls out govt, liberal/neocon establishment, but probably less compromised at mod-level than the conspiracytheories sub. Aaron Swartz must be rolling in his grave over the censorship and efforts to control the narrative via propagandistic talking points, smear campaigns, paid for likes, shares, upvotes, downvotes and reports to suppress and censor wrongthink. This is social media manipulation and Google and Youtube helps, as do "fact checkers" like Snopes, politifact, Atlantic Council/Belingcat, Factcheck.org. 

Basically what MSM does to old people, these efforts aim to do to the younger online crowd. Infiltrating and co-opting subs (just as is done to leftist/progressive groups/organizations and protests using agent provacateurs) propagandizing communities and with misleading and false talking points (actual disinformation), shaping and controlling the narrative and discourse, smearing anti-war/establishment/censorship pro-free press leftists, smearing and sabotaging subs and their community if they resist. We know dems like Hillary and Biden/Kamala have people on here (Twitter and elsewhere) but I'm sure the security state does as well. Just as they scrub/sanitize Wikipedia pages to protect certain figures while editing others to smear/read as opposition research.</div>

To elaborate, I'd say liberal (some neolibs, some neocons) and their dupes on the left aka mainstream left/vbnmw/shitlibs/bluemaga. Those particular leftists, enable the left being tamed by corporate centrists and are part of the rise of the authoritarian 'left' They parrot establishment dem propaganda and disinformation, censor and smear fellow leftist (even those to the left of them) as grifters, red-brown alliance, horseshoe theory, pushers of crazy right-wing conspiracy theories, talking points that help the right/enable Trumpers, so they say. That is basically their default is to call you a grifter and then try to connect you to the right and label any valid criticism and inconvenient truths as crazy right-wing propaganda to discredit you and it. The whole time, they run interference for leaders who don't leverage their power for progressive policy, leaders and a party that reject progressive policy and who helped make Trump a thing in the first place while working to stop progressives. But we're the dum dum and dirtbag left, right? They are nothing but projection machines and tools for the oligarchy.</div>

&gt;There an echo in here? I've listened to both sides and that's why I know you only replied with one side. 

Evidently not and the echo is your projection.


&gt;Do you understand consent? Ana making a raunchy joke does not give Dore carte blanche to harass her. 

Strawman and again, it does not look like he sexually harassed her.


&gt;Do you think it's okay to molest a porn star because they do porn?

&gt;Dore is right wing. 

No, he isn't. 

&gt;Dore really plays up his sexual harassment story, I recognize all the details you're using because you only ever listened to his side.  

Sounds like you have not actually listened to both sides of the story and heard/seen all the evidence before coming to a rational conclusion.


&gt;Being raunchy isn't the same as sexually harassing a coworker. It sure didn't give Jimmy the right to harass Ana

No, they weren't just raunchy but sexist and demeaning. The things Cenk and Ana has said is far worse than what Dore said. Again, Dore didn't sexually harass Ana.</div>

Where is the lie? This line seems like something you repeat to yourself while you spread lies about people.

&gt;if anyone looks at your profile they don't see that though

If they don't see it, then they aren't looking that hard.</div>

Nobody pays me to post. Again, what 'fake news' have I been pushing? I'm willing to bet this is projection on your part.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yet Tucker platformed a leftist.

Like saying 'nice news skirt' sarcastically when someone (a friend and his senior) is wearing something inappropriate for a news room and everyone laughs at it? A bit too many, then Dore felt bad and apologized and she accepted his apology? yeah. Usually sexual harassment holds some sexual intent. Any thoughts on Ana trying to blackmail Dore for him calling out TYT for their smears on Aaron Mate? No?

Again, consider the atmosphere, they guess who's segment segments and Cenk said sexist shit plenty of times and said something to a subordination that could be seen as sexual harassment, asking what price she would accept for nudes. Your outrage is fake or you are misinformed and prefer to stay that way in the face of countervailing evidence.

I don't think he 'sexually harassed' her. You strike me as a troll or an incredible dupe.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Where did he 'lie' about vaccines? Some YouTuber Shaun made a misleading video over him and Dore made a video addressing it and the confusion. Show me where he knowingly lied about the vaccine. 

No.

Maybe watch the actual segment or the Fred Hampton Segment about it that I linked. If you have proof that the person he interview lied to him and is a right-wing terrorist, please post it here. I don't see how it makes Dore a bad person for reaching across the isle - something moderate-centrist dems brag about being able to do.</div>
