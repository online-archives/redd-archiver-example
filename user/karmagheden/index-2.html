AOC is left. I don't see your point.

Nice loaded question, fallacious debate seems to be your M.O. 

Who is excusing sexual harassment? It's a bipartisan issue to answer your question. Just see those who have given Biden a pass and those who gave Cuomo a pass for years.

Tucker is a republican. I don't see your point.

Who said faux populism is left? Trump is a faux populist. Dore is a left-winger and an actual populist.

I don't see what point you're trying to make here. This is some gotcha guy shit. So he can't go on 'millionaire show run by billionaire conservatives' to promote pro-working class, anti-war, class solidarity sentiment or otherwise it isn't populism or spreading truth to power??</div>

&gt;Yes, because he got salty that AOC wouldn't come back to his studio. 

I don't think that is the reason for his criticisms and I don't know why you would say that if you have actually heard his criticisms of her and the squad, which are reasonable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and platformed a terrorist movement
&gt;
&gt;Verifiable fact. 

Context and nuance matters to good faith adults. He interviewed a boogaloo boy. He said be does not endorse them. Saying he platforms a terrorist movement is deceptive af.


&gt;Verifiable fact. I watched him do the laughing about it. That was part of his "debunk."

He made a joke about someone wearing inappropriate attire to work and that someone was his superior (and his joke literally pales in comparison to the things Cenk and Ana have said, look at the atmosphere they fostered trying to be like Howard Stern) and he apologized to her and it was water under the bridge and then years later she tried to blackmail him from criticizing them over their smearing of Aaron Mate. 


&gt;Don't you watch his videos? Lol

Yes, did you?</div>

He made valid criticisms of her and the squad 100% and he was one of the first people to platform AOC.

You vaush parrots talking points (willingly or otherwise) out the liberal establishment and security state and military industrial complex meant to smear anti-establishment anti-war and imperialism leftists like Dore. Dore is also pro working class and class solidarity in addition to him championing progressive policy/leftist policy, so I am utterly baffled why this mod claims Dore is no friend of workers. Seems like they ate the anti-Dore propaganda and disinformation without a critical thought and don't care to look at evidence that challenges that narrative, which is false btw.</div>

'Attacking,' well that's subjective. I would say legit criticisms and of course he spends more time criticizing dem party and leftist leaders because he is a leftist. He had criticized Trump and the GOP, so I don't know what more you want. If you want a leftist echochamber that ignores dem party corruption and inaction and just posts about GOP/Trump 24/7, try politics.


&gt;Would a millionaire like Tucker and his billionaire handlers let Rightist Jimmy on if he spoke truth to real power?

Why wouldn't they? Jimmy gets platformed and Tucker gets more views and has someone on that criticizes the opposing party, so they both benefit. Maybe you should be more concerned why liberal (supposedly leftist) MSM won't have on anti-establishment anti-imperialism leftist like Dore, but will have on pro-war/imperialism security state people. I'm curious what he said on Tucker's show that is fake news. Will you tell us, because it's what you are suggesting.


&gt;Rutger Bergman got censored from Tucker because he spoke truth to power.

I don't know what to tell you, Jimmy speaks truth to power.

&gt;Jimmy is a far right tool.

You sound like a crazy person. He is easily and clearly to the left of moderate dems nvm dems like Manchin.</div>

Factually incorrect.

&gt;in leagues with Tucker Carlson 

This is innuendo and guilty by association fallacy to smear him as a grifter. If Dore was invited on to liberal MSM outlets, he would go on them, but they don't, so he doesn't.

&gt;and the Boogaloo movement.

Misleading at best.

Just like Biden and Pelosi and Manchin. And I think you mean Republican politicians* The voters are actually for some of the same policies we are for on the left. We knew this back in 2015 from polls/surveys that many (if not most) of Bernie's main policies, were popular among most Americans!

&gt;And you have no problem with that

No, again with the fallacious reply. This is your typical absolutist shitlib mindset. I am complaining about democrats not doing more and making bullshit excuses for why they don't do more and I am complaining about certain democrats who lie about being powerless and other democrat who lie about having a progressive agenda, when really Manchin did them a favor.

They could have prevented more funding going to Capitol police. They could have withheld their votes on a must pass bill to get concessions or $15 minimum wage or perhaps M4A during a pandemic. Instead, they sent a strongly worded letter. On multiple occasions, they could have flexed their power but chose not to. Remember, they were keeping their powder dry for FTV and then never used it? Manchin in just one person. Schumer used FTV and used it performatively! Shielding dem and leftist leaders from criticism, especially legitimate criticism and attacking those who want to hold them accountable, is counterproductive to a progressive agenda. If you can't do this, what does it matter if Manchin or some R is against our agenda? Our own leadership, including Biden, is NOT onboard a progressive agenda.</div>

You then ignored my solutions and are saying I am essentially being unreasonable and asking too much from my leaders and that this is how it is, it's just how it works. Your entire response to me is exactly what you accused me of doing, you actually made a shitty complaint towards me and your solution is to keep doing more of the same, expecting something different to happen.

Dems collaborate with them on right wing legislation, then use them as an excuse why they can't do more, when in reality, it's just their agenda isn't a progressive one and doesn't include them moving left. 

I'm concerned with my party and it's leadership rejecting and not fighting for policy that is overwhelmingly popular among democrats and popular among most Americans, because it is the more immediate hurdle and threat for progressives, how do you not see that? Are you trolling me with this fallacious argument?</div>

Curious why any would be downvoted if our community is made up of people across the political spectrum and everyone is here in the fight against censorship. It's almost like there are users coming here from other subs to downvote and or users who are voting on bias over censorship.

Edit: We have the_mueller shitlibs and Vaush CIA-left types up in here and these people parroting talking points out the neoliberal political establishment, security state and military industrial complex. Wittingly or not, they are helping the corporate pro-war pro-censorship center by smearing fellow (if they even are leftists themselves) anti-establishment leftists, as right-wingers.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No, it's how I would describe pundits who are partisan hacks in liberal MSM and on FOX news. Krystal and Saagar aren't partisan hacks because they aren't afraid to criticize their own side and neither are they grifters like you see with liberal MSM pundits, for instance, who pretend they are leftists, but are corporate centrists center-right - just like the dem party - which does not reflect the lefts voter base and working class. Then again neither is the GOP any better for the working class or actually for populist policy like Bernie was advocating for - which is popular among most Americans across party lines.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I gotcha. It's crazy that Biden, Kamala, Pelosi, Fauci, even ACLU were against mandates a year ago, a few of them pushing vaccine hesitancy or outright saying they would not take it, but are now accusing people of being anti-vax for criticizing their lies over covid (specifically from Fauci and Biden) and their hypocrisy over mandates. They even accused John Campbell and Robert Malone of being anti-vax for talking about the effectiveness of the vaccines and how they are implemented. Look how Cuomo was being given an award over covid while the nursing home scandal was happening and how later he said he doesn't trust health experts and when people like myself were calling him out at the start and pointing out how he was being promoted on social media via astroturf, we were censored. Reminds me of how we could say Fuck Trump anytime anywhere and be cheered for it, but now if we say 'let's go Brandon,' we are accused of being cowards etc and right-wingers lmao. The hypocrisy of the liberal/neoliberal (not leftists) crowd, is astounding and their absolutist mindset and embrace of censorship and the security state, is very alarming.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;**It was a low effort meme** that wasn't worth all of this.

Is that why they removed it (?) and does it change the fact that their reasoning over the removal is arbitrary? Wasn't worth what? Being banned? Don't worry, I'll find other subs to post funny political stuff to. Or my response? It's been a long time coming. I have a history of them removing posts of mine in the past (vast majority of the time, the reason given: 'did not make an attempt at humor' despite it being upvoted in other leftist communities an even when the community there found it funny and upvoted it) and one mod (who did some of the removing and at least one temp ban) throwing out personal attacks directed at me in the very threads of post of mine which they removed.

You're response is essentially: you picked a shitty hill to die on, and my reply to that is: it's still censorship and mod abuse.  You think they don't use rules like this to remove content and posters or said content, that that do not like? Rules that they don't apply in the same manner to cover content and posters of said content that share their bias and or agenda. Is that not worrisome to you? The quality or opinion of the quality of the meme, is irrelevant when you consider the above. Low effort btw compared to what? Do you see what gets posted and upvoted to that sub on the regular?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't even feel like these people are left, but closer to centrists, especially with their embrace of censorship and authoritarianism. Bear in mind also that these same people who emphasize  over and over how Trump was this fascist threat to democracy, when Biden and Obama were/are just as authoritarian and anti-popular progressive policy, are anti-press freedom and whistleblower, and are seemingly totally fine with interference by political social media astroturf/manipulation, the DNC/DCCC and liberal MSM to undermine and subvert democracy and to stop progressives and support for progressive policy with gaslighting and manufacturing consent. The same people who would say he is racist and a creep but look the other way when Biden is the same exact thing! They will call you hyper partisan for daring to criticize your leaders on the left and hold them accountable, and even when you promote class solidarity over cultural divide enabled by MSM and astroturf out the political establishment. The willful ignorant and hypocrisy of this group on the left (even they are even on the left), is astounding</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Well, this sums up the reasoning they gave me /u/karmagheden: 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;post tons of hyper-partisan content elsewhere around the site. They're not engaging in good faith.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Someone who drops slurs so quickly and casually cannot be reasoned with 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;This user's actions are extreme though and they clearly have a history that tells me they give zero fucks about changing/just want to screech.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;We're willing to talk to people/issue temp bans/warn properly when appropriate. This user was here in bad faith/attacking others/dropping slurs. He waived his right to dialogue. 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;their entire history is attacks, slurs, and extremist content. What makes you think a warning would change that? That's their identity, this isn't a moment of "heated exchange" or "them being upset/impulsive". They won't change.
&gt;
&gt;I agree with them that your behavior is problematic. But I don't think a permanent ban with no reason + 1 month mute is appropriate.

I did not ask you to speak with them on my behalf. You provided apologia when I was banned from Futurology and provided no response to me when I provided citation and pointed out that I wasn't aware that not doing so, was a ban warranting offense. I don't think that is even a rule. Let me also reply to your previous comment, shitlib is no worse of a slur than calling someone a troll. Maybe your kneejerk reaction has you thinking of the term libtard often used by conservatives? I  was directly called a troll and a putinbot, but those attacks aren't attacks and slurs in the eyes of the mods there, but I use the term shitlib and not even directed at another user and that warrants this outrage? What hyper-partisan content?  What leads them to believe I am not in good faith? Spending the time to defend myself against troll accusations? I am 100% in good faith and their entire take is just so ridiculous. As if your apologia wasn't bad enough. What problematic behavior? Calling out astroturf (my initial comment there that was upvoted) or pointing out how there is portion of the left who loves censorship and will twist themselves into pretzels to defend leadership from criticism and being held accountable and will attack fellow leftists for daring to do so. Bernie bro is just as bad, worse even as it is based on a myth, whereas shitlibs are actually a thing. Had I just said liberal or neoliberal, it would be all fine though, right? Mods with that mentality are what is wrong with the left, along with those who give apologia for their censorship. I don't know what else to say to their response but that it is so absurd. I do not post in bad faith and what hyper partisan content??? I criticize republicans and democrats and even progressive leaders. I have promoted unity and class solidarity. Isn't that the opposite of being a partisan hack??</div>

But how is that "Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence may be removed." Where am I dismissing well-established science?

And I wasn't aware that I needed to provide examples of these lies. You would think it would be common knowledge by now for anyone who follows these things. 

A quick google search:

https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/noble-lies-covid-fauci-cdc-masks.html

Did you know the director of policy worked for Atlantic Council who is affiliated with the CIA? Did you know they work with social media like Facebook and 'fact checkers' like Snopes to flag and get stuff they don't like removed, even if it is not misinformation or 'Russian disinformation' just like with the Hunter Biden story? Have you see the politics sub, or the state of politicalhumor, presidentialracememes, liberal, Democrats, progressive and other large leftist politics sub? They appear completely co-opted and controlled/manipulated by the corp center, by liberals and Biden stans, by conflict of interest mods, trolls, vote manipulation, automod censorship etc, not by actual progressives. A number of these subs look like liberal/dem establishment propaganda boards and nothing like they did back before the 2016 election, where people like Tulsi and Ralph Nader were upvoted. When stuff about Assange and Greenwald was upvoted .</div>

Edit: Just search 'Bezos' in that sub. I see 5 posts about him posted in the last month, that are still up. One of them posted just 9 hours ago. I posted mine 18 hours ago. The mod who removed this post is likely the mod who temp banned me last time around as they have engaged me in multiple threads, calling me things like tankie/bad faith/troll and I mentioned this to the other mods and they don't seem to care. He also refers to progressives unhappy with Biden as being fringe left.</div>

&gt;But you deserve to be banned for spreading un-proven theories while dissenting the opinion of health professionals. This puts people at risk and is common reactionary behavior.

No, I don't think it did as the official narrative - which is spread as fact - has not yet been proven. How is that then not also an unproven theory? How am I putting anyone at risk by posting something the former CDC head said? I posted his opinion and then speculation about that opinion and about the holes in the official narrative, that is all.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Well the former CDC head was a Trump party shill and has next to zero credibility today. Just like this bullshit theory. 

He is hardly the only one to suggest it is possible or even plausible. 

https://youtu.be/RzwmtICyOCs

https://youtu.be/dnY2OtnTOcA

Then there's the other post to that sub about the same topic, which wasn't removed, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk0wLN5uuU

What you think about the former head of the CDC, whether it's true or not, does not justify censorship. Especially not when this theory is corroborated by others in the field who do not seem politically motivated. To ignore them would mean YOU are politicizing this rather than coming at it with skepticism and using critical thought.  

Edit: There's been a number of virologists who have suggested this theory/hypothesis has merit and to my knowledge, they are not right-wing/shills for Trump. I don't see the issue with the speculation. What is your agenda here? Accused everyone who is rightfully skeptical of the official narrative of being Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, I had this happen to me over at Democrats, liberal and progressive and then got banned when I inquired why my posts weren't showing up, and often when I was simply defending myself from ad hominem attacks or defending my wrongthink positions with reputable citation. I had posts to other subs not show up, like over at politics and I assumed it was the automod algorithm to censor certain words and phrases but when I inquired, *if* I heard back, they would act ignorant (maybe they were) say I got caught up as spam or they would say it's a site wide admin censorship/shadow ban and that I should talk to *them* about it. In many cases I would ask then if I could have my post approved and they would either not respond or arbitrarily use/stretch the rules with interpretation to back up the algorithm of the automod to justify the removal. That also was an issue, as I remember a while back one of the new people working at Reddit had a history with the intel community and they used a site wide automod to remove any mention of her name. So I think it's pretty clear there's biased mods all over the place abusing their power but more importantly there appear to be conflict of interest / compromised mods who act and post and mod as if they are dem operatives with intent to silence wrongthink and help to control the narrative and conversation and this works in tandem with astroturf and vote manipulation / brigading / forum slide etc to suppress wrongthink and prop up official talking points that manufacture consent and often gaslight.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It's not moderator failure but moderator corruption/abuse i.e. arbitrarily enforcing rules to fit their bias and silence dissent/control the conversation - which reinforces the official narratives out the liberal establishment / intelligence community / military industrial complex. You have trolls/bad faith users w/e who help with this with astroturf and brigade vote manipulation and helping to collapse certain comments to kill exposure or keep a certain post in controversial. It only takes a small push to get something in rising and then casual politics goers take over with blind upvotes. It to kill exposure to certain criticisms and inconvenient facts/ugly truths and to control the narrative of what is considered truth and what is considered 'fake news' or 'Russia/right-wing propaganda' or 'misinformstion' or 'Russian disinformation' or 'conspiracy theories.'  Casuals with group think/echo chamber (and tragedy of the commons) will look votes to tell them whether something is true or not and these people may take upvoted falsehoods and start spreading them in their circles, while ignoring the downvoted comments even if they are sourced and contain facts. If anyone talks wrongthink in those threads on the front and brings citation, they will be brigade downvoted and likely ganged up on and  with all manner of ad hominems and fallacious retorts and you may even have you comments removed by a mod or by silently automod while trying to defend yourself and all while dealing with a 15 minute wait to post when you have multiple people wrongly accusing your of being a Trump supporter or Russian troll or literally gaslighting and pushing misinformation to run cover for "moderate" corporate centrists/conservative dems. And you don't just have biased/conflict of interest/compromised mods and trolls/shills/operatives gaslighting but you have bad faith users bogus reporting content to get it removed and often mods of these subs remove content (and even users) seemingly without too much thought, unless they have an agenda. Tl;dr there is a war on information going on and Reddit, just like Twitter, is plagued with trolls/shills/bots, censorship and efforts to control the flow of information and the conversation.</div>

Notice some of those posts stay up, so I guess mods don't always agree with you. What you do is more sad than people who enjoy collecting karma.

I *also* have a life outside of Reddit and if you look me up on Redditmetis you will see my account activity is not bot-like and also there are accounts with 10/20/30 million post karma. It is not terribly hard to collect karma and Reddit even encourages users to show off their karma, though notice how I don't do that because I use old reddit. If I cared as much as you think I do about karma, I would have pinned my best posts by now to show them off, don't you think?</div>

Mostly the stuff that is removed is from presidentialracememes or politicalhumor (which I addressed here when I was banned from them) or maybe political_revolution or democraticsocialism (when it is of stuff too critical of corporate center/military industrial complex/security state, from independent media outlets/journalists*). I've had some stuff removed from nextfuckinglevel and a few other subs, but they have not given me warnings or temp/permabanned me.</div>

No, I am not a shill and this is not a karma farming account, I just enjoy collecting karma. Perma banning someone over the above and when the users has made it clear they didn't intentionally violate any rules, is extreme. Yes, I think they wronged me or else I wouldn't have bothered posting this here. We can agree to disagree though.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Obama didn't need to drop it but did anyways. You can say it is because it wouldn't pass, and whether that is true or not, does not make what I said untrue. The other part is that dems had a majority in both houses of Congress for two years. Yes, and upon further research technically the supermajority was for about 6 months, so I guess that part is untrue but it is not disinformation, intentional lies to mislead people. The point is they had power to do more then but didn't. They blame it on the filibuster but we all know that Obama was not as progressive as he initially led on and that big money and special interests is why he didn't do more, not just because of republicans/the filibuster. I see misinformation and even blatant lies protecting corporate dems and those users continue posting unabated despite their gaslighting, but I get banned over this? Show me please what part of my comment is disinformation?</div>
