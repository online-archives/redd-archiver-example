    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah they weren’t going to give up the nuclear weapons they had physically but no control over.  But that memorandum holds very little weight... It’s riddled with “shoulds” and no “shalls” or “wills”. Important distinction that you don’t care about for some reason.  There’s no obligation here, it’s not a strong security pact. 

Again… Russia is in violation but the US has no obligations here. Why do you think Ukraine is so desperate to join NATO?  It’s because article 5 *would* pull other countries into direct conflict.  

If you were right, wouldn’t we have declared war once Russia annexed Crimeria in 2014? Why not now?  It’s exhausting trying to explain all of this to you. My brain isn’t weird, you have no understanding in which you spew nonsense.</div>

Do you know what per capita means??

US contributions: 67.7 billion

US population: ~342 million

US contribution per capita: €198/person

EU contributions+countries: 144.1 billion

EU population: ~742 million

EU contribution per capita: €194/person

So no, the US 100% gives more per capita. 

Now you confused “per capita” with “as a percentage of GDP”, which you’re correct, the US economy is stronger than the sum of all the countries in the EU. But we’re also, you know, NOT IN EUROPE.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">lol. The money sent to Ukraine since the 1990s (and might I add, countless “regional partners”) is funny to bring up, because the US is by far funding the military effort in Ukraine. And I mean PUMPING cash into that war. This is separate from sending money to regional partners which we do globally on an annual basis. 

You say I’m wrong but you’ve not come up with one argument that refutes anything I’m saying.</div>

There are only six points of agreement in the memo and when summarized, five of them start with the words “Respect,” “Refrain from,” and “Consult with.” Clearly those points of agreement do not require the United States to go to war.</div>

I understand there’s treaties that are not NATO.

But like I said that’s a bit off topic, but yes - it’s a travesty that the Kurds don’t have their own country. You’re using an off topic side comment I said in parenthesis because you have no force behind your argument.

I’m not fucking splitting hairs *at all*. Please read NATO Article 5. That’s the level of requirement and detail needed. A 30 year old (and vague) memorandum is 100% not what’s required to solidify an alliance. 

You think my views are inept because I want to support allies and people that worked with us for many years during the middle eastern conflict (which we also shouldn’t have been involved in the first place, but pulling the rug out from under the Kurds is kind of my entire point above). Like you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">\>Lol first off economics and geography wont allow Kurdistan to be it's own country lol you do realize that that country cant exists surrounded by countries that hate Kurds with no access to the sea? Not to mention the fact that the usa would have to invade iran, iraq, Syria, Turkey and Armenia.

The Kurds were allies for a very long time with the US.  And we pulled out, fucking them over - this was my biggest issue with Trump's foreign policy, and was a travesty.  But my point stands that your view on them is quite racist "minority group shouldn't have their own country".

\>Well you just described a false ally if Israel is aligning with our biggest rival in china and giving them technology.

I don't think there's any evidence that Israel is "aligned with China".  A single instance of a collaboration is hardly a betrayal, even though I strongly am against the idea.

\>The Budapest memorandum wasn't a trilateral statement lol it was a agreement on security guarantees.

The Budapest memorandum is literally called "Trilateral Statement", nor was it a security agreement assuring their defense as a nation.  There is \*nothing\* in it that entitles Ukraine to a specific response from the United States (or others).  It's not an official treaty.  Read about it and stop preaching as if it was. 

\>So your views on American geopolitics are to support a country who helps our rivals.

Of course not, but your immediate generalization of a specific instance is certainly a \*little\* obtuse.  

\>To help a minority group who is a ally of convenience with a perceived territory that is in 5 separate countries and one of those countries is an ally. All the while ignore a country that is actually helping us by destroying the military capability of our second biggest rival so in the future we can focus on one.

I am 100% disinterested in supporting Ukraine, correct.  If anything, it is proving the military technology of the US works well (specifically Javelins), I guess that's a silver lining.

\>We get absolutely nothing for giving Israel weapons it doesn't make America safe it's the opposite we now have to bomb Yemen and iraq. While in Ukraine they have destroyed something like half of Russian active tanks prewar.

There are obvious benefits to being allied with Israel...?

Also please use some basic grammar and formatting, your responses are giving me a headache.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh dear. Let me clarify some things for you. 

The Trilateral statement in 94 isn’t a treaty. Guess who else was a co-signer? Russia... Referencing a non-treaty agreement from 30 years ago is kind of a moot point. 

There’s no question that Israel does some questionable things… but they’re still allies. And for clarification - they are allies, and Ukraine are *not*.

And you stating the minority statement about the Kurds is just… holy shit how ignorant. Kurds are certainly not a minority in Kurdistan (which should be its own country, but that’s a different topic). It’s clear to me based on that fucked up statement that you’re saying if Ukraine was a minority group, they should get fucked? Wow…</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Europe is a continent. Europe is a geographical location. It isn’t a place that helps anyone do anything. A large piece of Europe have countries that have aided the US, but your comment is nonsensical to justify being involved in the conflict just because it’s “in Europe”. 

Ukraine… as much as it sucks they’re getting attacked was not in an alliance with the US.  It’s also a massively corrupt state historically which plays into the whole NATO membership thing. 

If Russia attacked a NATO ally (such as Poland, as you pointed out) all of the map here would go to war. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO

The same people that were wondering why we were at war in the Middle East are the same ones supporting Ukraine. We have no business being there and supporting the conflict, in my opinion. 

Israel is *completely* different because we’re literally allies with them (unlike Ukraine). If we were allied with Ukraine, I’d support the conflict in a similar way. But we aren’t. 

Hell we have/had *much* stronger ties with the Kurds, which we so gracefully fucked over in the Middle East. So if we’re pulling away from them, why support Ukraine?</div>
