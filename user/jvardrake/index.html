Yes.  All of the big subs are used by the left for setting/controlling the narrative.  You're not allowed to post/comment in a way that contradicts with what they are selling.

You posted a tweet from Glen Greenwald where he attacks the left by saying, “ Most liberal-left outlets are too scared, too censorious, or too devoted to abusing their function to help Biden win to publish one of the most accomplished and honest journalists in the country, 
@mtaibbi”

Do you honestly think that the leftists that run that sub did some sort of thorough investigation of your past, and went, “oh, wait, guise... false alarm.  This guy is actually one of us”?

No.  They saw you posted something that spoke ill of the left, and BAN.

That’s just how it works.  Spend some more time on this sub, and maybe you’ll start to get it.

Don’t shoot the messenger.</div>

That being said, with regards to nearly all of the main/large subs, leftist/sjw types are the ones creating this issue.  They ban for anything they don’t like, and will mute you so that you can’t even communicate with them.

It’s absolutely ridiculous that this is allowed for major subs on one of the internet’s largest places for discussion.  No one should be allowed that level of unchecked power to silence people for completely arbitrary reasons.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; It's absurd how easily people get banned with no recourse but appealing to the very people who banned you in the first place, who too often are biased themselves and unlikely to be honest with themselves (let alone anybody else) and admit they might've made a mistake and been too quick to judge by initial appearance themselves. I've long complained Reddit needs a better process in place.

If you are a person that values freedom of speech, open exchange of ideas/thoughts, etc., the way reddit works is unbelievably flawed.  

What inevitably happens is that - eventually - for any given subject, a particular sub ends up reaching critical mass, and becomes "the" sub for that subject.  Once that happens, it basically becomes extremely hard/outright impossible to get any sort of numbers for another sub that deals with the same subject.  

At this point, what *then* happens is that the most militant, vocal, activist minded people end up taking over that sub.  They downvote, and subsequently eliminate any dissenting voices, and - if they manage to get enough of theirs placed in the moderation team for that sub - outright ban anyone that doesn't toe the party line.  Once that happens, they have total control over who is allowed to discuss that subject, and what they are allowed to say.

With demographics being the way they are on reddit, it's the radical left that does this here, and the state of things clearly reflects that.  

Any sub that has any sort of reach, and regularly reaches the front-page, is absolutely *ruled* by these people.  They insert their politics into *all* of those subs, and they are actively using their control to attempt to shape the public narrative; they do *not* tolerate any dissent.

Thus, we get what this guy here (and many - *many* - others have experienced): if you don't think exactly like they do, *you will eventually not be allowed to speak at all.*  

What is more sinister - I think - is that people who wander in here from the rest of the internet see what is/isn't allowed to be said, and they too become conditioned to view those dissenting opinions as "wrong-think"...

To sum things up, for any subject that isn't a niche subject, this site is almost pure echo-chamber propaganda now.  All the large subs have been seized by the activist left; speak in any way that they don’t approve of - even if it’s something that the **vast** majority of society would find totally acceptable - you are simply banned.  You have no recourse - there is no one to appeal to.  They, and they alone have been given stupid amounts of unelected, unchecked power to decide what can be said, and who is allowed to say it.

Again - if you are the sort of person that values the free exchange of ideas, reddit is an absolute disaster.  If, however, you are a leftist activist, this place is amazing: you have near total control of one of the internet's main platforms for discourse, and *you* get to decide what is/isn't allowed to be said.</div>
