    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>My guess is that you wouldn't be surprised at all the amount of people who fall for simple shit like <a href="https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/">https://moxie.org/software/sslstrip/</a> -- That's not even the latest and greatest.  I have tools that I cannot post here due to NDA.</p>
<p>Additionally, several rogue SSL vendors were caught years ago duplicating SSL certs, Several Laptop vendors installed their own certs on machines which allowed snooping, etc.  If you've kept up with the industry at all, you know this already.</p>
<p>It's also funny that you list the largest, names in the IT field as hating the GPLv2 - because that's exactly what the GPLv2 was designed to protect against.  Large companies who slurp up peoples hard work and do not give back in the slightest.  You literally just made my argument for me.</p>
<p>Comcast is not a government-backed cable monopoly, Comcast is a cable monopoly who has used regulatory capture via government to stifle competition.  Net Neutrality was in direct opposition to what they've accomplished so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you take the time to read every religious text that you don't have faith in, of every religion ever?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The major ones, yes.  It's called educating yourself, and you should read the Net Neutrality laws as they were written because your arguments all rest on bullshit.  And since the bullshit asymmetry principle exists, it's easy for you to shovel out line after line of nonsensical drivel. </p>
<p>Net Neutrality doesn't help Comcast, Verizon, or AT&amp;T at all.  They all hated it, because it meant they would have to remain neutral in their delivery of data.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>SSL certs are easily bypassed, I also work as a programmer in the IT Security industry.  Since...age 18 or so, so nearly as long as you.  I've gone to DEFCON for the past decade, and also help run the local LUG.  I started with Windows NT, and ran somewhere close to 100 domains prior to ditching the entire industry.  (Because it's so damn hard to imagine that people could be as dumb as they are when you're the one who has to fix their problems)</p>
<p>The government is an enforcement agency.  If you want laws, then you have to have someone with the power to enforce them.  You're using a pretty obvious kafka trap as an argument here.  If you want &quot;free market capitalism&quot;, you have to have laws which keep those companies from just simply killing each other.  You have to have rules.</p>
<p>Unfettered capitalism results in a single entity owning everything and becoming your government.  Except their primary concern isn't you, it's how they can milk you.</p>
<p>I also work with Ad-hoc networks in the IT field.  LoRA is currently the closest thing we have to widespread ad-hoc networks like you explain, and it's limited (severely) in bandwidth.  Come on, you can do better than this.  You know this shit already.</p>
<p>That's fine.  Continue supporting &quot;genuinely free software&quot;.  I'll continue supporting copyleft licenses, because I've benefited from them in the company that I run.  My work has likewise, benefited others.</p>
<p>And I agree with you on regulatory capture.  Lots of these large corporations have used the government as a tool to stifle competition.  Net neutrality is also a prime protector of that very thing.  It says that Comcast, for example, cannot throttle Netflix because Comcast happens to be trying to bring up their own movie-streaming service.  It forces corporations to stop violating the rights of others.  None of these places would exist without the government and right-of-way laws.  Nobody would have been able to build &quot;the internet&quot; in the first place if it weren't for those laws which we granted the government the ability to license.</p></div>

<p>Net Neutrality is about ISPs not being able to stifle <em>YOUR</em> freedom of speech.  To not be able to block FOX news, for example, because they don't like FOX's political stance.  To make sure the internet isn't turned into a &quot;pay-per-channel&quot; shitshow that Cable has turned into.</p></div>
