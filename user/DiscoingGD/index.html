    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There's a difference between saying "We're better off with less \_\_\_ people" or "I'm going to eradicate \_\_\_ people". For a less polarizing example, replace '\_\_\_ people' with 'rapists'. The former is an opinion (in this case, a good one) and the latter is a threat (also, arguably a good one).

As I said in another comment, and I quote:

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm not an absolutist, but I think free speech is important and we need more than we have now, not less. I don't know the most efficient way to draw the line. Definitely a direct call to violence/harm is a no-no. Harassment is too ambiguous, but obviously you don't want people to be able to target/bombard individuals who are just passing by on the street. A false immediate threat like shouting 'bomb' or 'fire' should be illegal.

There are a lot of nuances that need to be addressed/discussed. However, I don't think 'hate speech' should be forbidden, assuming it doesn't fall into threat/harassment.</div>

A video from this sub, r/interestingasfuck, showed up in my feed. It was in German, so idk what he was saying, but it looked like a guy making a Nazi salute and saying something (joking or not, idk) in front of the police and then getting arrested. I said half jokingly "Idk, arresting someone for speech seems like a Nazi thing to do." I quickly got permabanned from this sub I've never interacted with before.

This dude, likely the top Mod on that sub, thinks supporting someone's free speech (which yes, I'm sure is less protected in Germany but I support it anyway) means agreeing with them. They also seem to get off on 'Nazis bad'. Like, of course they are, there's nothing brave or groundbreaking about shouting that you hate Nazis.

Anyway, I think the Mod is stupid, the sub is stupid, and 99% of the time reddit as a whole is stupid, all of them sharing a love of censorship.</div>
