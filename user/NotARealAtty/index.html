I'm sure it just coincidence that the ones that meet the completely subjective ambiguos standard of breaking the rules just so happen to be opposition  to your opinions. It's fine if you're in favor of removing anything you disagree with, but nobody is fooled that you're doing it under the guise of "following the rules."</div>

It's outrageous either way, but when your censoring/banning ideas that the community is actively agreeing with it sends a pretty strong message that you don't have logic, reason or factual evidence on your side. I'm glad to have a discussion and my views are certainly subject to being changed with new information, but it's always the same insults followed by being reported and the  banned. What's the point of even discussing things of you're only willing to discuss them with others that 100% agree? </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I certainly don't consider myself right wing, though I gave up on the left right dichotomy in describing my own views years ago.  I'm just extremely disturbed by this growing acceptance of censoring the "wrong" ideas.  Even ideas I despise, whether right, left or anything else, I would never attempt to deny a person from expressing them.  I can understand drawing the line at incitement to violence (though claiming that happened in the instance of uncensorednews is a spurious claim.)  I have significant experience learning constitutional law from professors on both sides of the spectrum and despite their personal ideologies, I was always impressed with their refusal to silence unpopular opinions.  The "free speech/first amendment," also framed as a state vs private actor distinction seems to be popping up more frequently on reddit over the past yr.  Suddenly people that couldn't point you to the first amendment seem to think they're constitutional law scholars after reading this distinction in a comment thread and 10 min on wikipedia.  Reddit obviously can do whatever they want as a private company, but that doesn't mean shouldn't voice their disapproval.  The ironic thing is most of the people in favor of the censorship are the same ones outraged when a bakery refuses to bake a cake for a wedding (which I'm not weighing on on substantively, just pointing out the hypocrisy).  I make a point to keep my views as consistent as possible and when I discover a flaw with them, attempt to become informed enough to rectify any dissonance.  The best way to do this is to hear all types of ideas, even the offensive or hateful ones.  That's the deal with free speech, the shitty ideas get a chance to be heard like any other.  Logic and reason dictate which ideas grow and spread and rise above the shitty ones.  

Sorry to rant, but I obviously have strong opinions on the matter, and due to my background and actually in a position to take an informed position.  It's terrifying that over 50% of undergrads these days think it's ok to silence "bad" ideas/speech, which includes nearly a majority of conservatives.  It's mind boggling that people can't see the slippery slope with censoring speech/content based on viewpoint.  The 1st amendment and SCOTUS have always taken this approach because historically our country could see the danger and opportunity for abuse of only censoring "bad" speech.  By the time it's their own speech being censored it will be too late, which should be common knowledge since their are endless examples of classic literature, fables/folktales, failed governments/ideologies, and even court rulings that everyone has been exposed to that should make the dangers obvious.  Suddenly words in themselves are a violent end, which is not in line with reality.</div>

No matter how disgusting you find it it is "still just words." I suppose you're in favor of book burning too since words can be so dangerous. I suggest you read fahrenheit 451, but I'm sure you would somehow find it too upsetting. </div>
