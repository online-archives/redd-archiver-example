But the point was that when china will be gone within a century or so there will be no Chinese left. Just like there were no Chinese before china emerged and no romans left since the Roman Empire is gone. 

&gt; Oh look, he's still being racist.

Apparently [this one] (https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590969af2179605b11ad69b8/master/w_900,c_limit/101108_r20184_p886.jpg) and [this one] (https://grrrgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xi_china_nba_cartoon.jpg) are too. I guess [this one] (https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztjvs4eIA3DqPoA/source.gif) should be extra racist then. 

You are probably one of those who called Charlie Hebdo racist and the attack on them "a well deserved retaliation". 

Isn't it's China communist party's fault we have a pandemic on a rise?</div>

I can get my head around that there are groups that stretches over race and nationality (the core base of ethnicity) but if there is no China there is no Chinese and it has nothing to do with race. 

My main point was you should use correct word regardless of OP's personality. The only reason you refuse to use xenophobic is because it's not that politically charged. 

The only one who attacks people based on their personality is you as there was nothing racist in the OP's post you've taken down purely out your political prejudges. 

The examples may be deemed as personal are only there to call out your hypocrisy and racism bullshit.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">See? You did it again. Gish gallop means to overwhelm opponent with as many arguments as possible. I was making one argument over and over again and just followed your lead. Lefties always try to redefine words because objective reality that words describe never fit your fantasy world. 

Judging people based on their ETHNICITY is called xenophobic not racist by definition of... racism. You are just arbitrary use this term to serve you needs. 

There are three categories: race – based in biology, nation – in political geography and ethnicity – in culture. All are deeply intertwined but very distinct. They are not arbitrary. Some assholes claim this are social constructs but good luck to construct a white Japanese out of a Nigerian – this doesn't even have a meaning. 

One can be Asian (race), Chinese (geography) and Han (culture). You can be racist to asians and xenophobic to Chinese and Han. Both are not civil. 

By the way china and Chinese are two different things. 

Tell me how you feel about great Japanese culture and their ethnic values that made them so great? Does those feelings make you a racist?

And still you refuse to answer why you target people online.

I tried to use less words not to overwelhm you with reading.))</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh, you’re completely out of the loop and just putting words in my mouth.

&gt; Blacks are not a race because 

There was no because in what I've said. Black is a race. 

Genocides on the other hand are almost never race related. They happen between the nations who are related or even within one nation – like cultural revolution genocide. 

Rwanda genocide wasn't racist as "people behind" it were... Tutsi and Hutu who killed each other. You can hate Tutsi and be okay with blacks in general. This doesn't make you a racist. It makes you a nationalist or maybe a bigot. So calling Rwanda genocide racist is like calling Tiananmen, Yunnan or Daoxian massacres were racist. 

Chinese has tons of prejudices toward Japanese but this doesn't make them racist just nationalist – you know the one that CCP is so eager to raise. There is a word for this – Nipponophobia. 

&gt; Jews are not a singular race 

Jew is not a race at all. It's a nation just like Arab and Chinese. National socialist persecuted Jews – maybe that will give you a clue on distinction between nationalism and racism. 

As a matter of fact Jews invented a special term for their persecution – anti-semitism. Despite the fact that semite isn't a synonym for a Jew and include arabs and some extinct nations somehow it sticked.  

&gt; Calling all white people warmongering sister-fuckers or all Indians dirty rapists 

The former is racist because white is a race just like black. The latter maybe nationalistic, chauvinistic or xenophobic depending on the context because Indian is a nation. 

Because you know... word has meaning and their main purpose is to convey that meaning. 

I guess you are too lazy and/or stupid (I'll give you benefit of a doubt) to look up a definition of a racist so here you go:

&gt; racist /ˈreɪsɪst/ noun
a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.

Racism is just like communism it oversimplifies your world view and lead to false conclusions. 

To be racist you have to simultaneous meet two criteria: show prejudice and base it exclusively on one's race (not nation). 

Notice you don't have to be an outsider to be racist. White socialist are predominantly racist because they show prejudice toward white solely on the basis of race. 

But you can't be racist to Chinese if you target them exclusively as Chinese and not as Asian. It doesn't makes it okay nor it makes it racist. 

On the other hand following your logic you should see [this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harry_R._Hopps,_Destroy_this_mad_brute_Enlist_-_U.S._Army,_03216u_edit.jpg) or [this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lindsay_German_monster.jpg) as racist towards white people which makes no sense. It was made by white people and was targeted exclusively toward Germans. As a matter of fact there is a special word for this too – germanophobia. 

What is obvious to me is that many nations China have walked all over (like Taiwan, HK, Tibet, etc.) hate China just like Chinese hate Japan. What is also obvious is that this hate doesn't make all them racist. Guess it's all have more to do with historical context rather than bigotry.

By the way you didn't answer why you dig through tons comments in order to target specific type of people. As it seems like you've spend a lot of time on this hunt for the past 7 years as if it was your day job.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well words have meaning you know and it's not China who define them. I'm not arguing for the use of this term just that it isn't racist. 

The Japanese haven't defined the word as a racist ethnic slur. According to your own translation they defined it as "close to being derogatory". Well Japanese is a very polite nation I'd say. 

About your links:

1 isn't dragon one of [China's symbols] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_China) so I guess you can't claim depicting china as a dragon is racist. Isn't it's part of cousine in some parts of china to consume variety of creatures like [cats and snakes] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_tiger_phoenix) or rats and insects? So depicting it as a part of Chinese culture can't be even derogatory. Let alone some crazy stuff with traditional medicine and superstitious believes in the country. So how come stating the fact is racist? Whould you consider an obese Uncle Sam munching burgers racist too?

2 it's quite an obvious truth just like two whites can't make a Chinese baby. I can agree it probably had an intent to be derogatory (idk maybe Wong is a slur) but just like it failed to be a joke it failed to be racist but ended as a poor taste. 

3 how "fuck china" is racist? It is a political statement and even isn't targeted on Chinese people only on the country. 

Once again Chinese is not a race.

I didn't ask how you matched patterns. I asked for what reason you've checked hundreds of comments in that thread? Do you regularly do that to all threads in that sub or you target only threads with a specific topics?</div>

Well I've read the wiki page you've attached. It wasn't that dramatic. It was an ordinary way to call Chinese which through the corse of several Sin-Japanese conflicts gained negative connotation due to Japanese contempt toward Chinese. Basicly it's like if i hypothetically would call you Rice_22 as a synonym of a gready communist pig and then you pout as you feel offended... by your own name. 

As you may rightfully compare this term to a word "negro" I can't get what is your complain. As a matter of fact word negro is used in us census as "some older black Americans still self-identify with the term". 

&gt; literally called for the genocide of Chinese people 

Through out the history Chinese people had accomplished it very much by themselves. Mao's great leap "forward" that claimed 30 mil lives at least just after genocidle "cultural" revolution would be a very good example. There is definetly no help needed.</div>

Zhina isn't that equivalent. It maybe an ethnic slur (never heard it before) but not racial.

The only reason you use word racist is the same reason all lefties use it – to shut down people with opinions you don't like. 

&gt; Your assumptions are hilariously inaccurate because he's not from HK, I am.

His time zone has nothing to do with his ethnicity so you know.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You call him racist with no prove to it. 

Ban evasion is against rules. Having multiple accounts isn't. 

People constantly complain on legit ban as a censorship. This isn't unique to this particular user. What your first two links has to prove anyway?

&gt; Here you go:

The first link leads to:
"Explain how that is racism wumao also I cannot be racist against chinese people becasue I am Chinese muyself.

我不可以做对种族主义反支那人，因为我是支那人自己。"

Maybe there is something racist written in Chinese otherwise it's clear. 

The second lead to some gibberish mumbles of a Marxist pig Jean Paul-Sartre... cited by you. Apperently all the fuss in the second thread is about word Zhīnà (支那) (which is obviously where the word China rooted). And apperently this word became derogatory due to it's use by Japanese who walked all over China too many times. So we can draw a conclusion that this term is mostly used by Japanese to insult Chinese. So by no stretch this can be attributed as racist as both nations are the same race. 

We can say some nationalism is at place here. Given the current Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong I'd bet this one is a hongkonger. On the bright side hongkonger calling himself Chinese is something to celebrate in China.

On the other hand we know you are very pro China and anti HongKong and the fact that you chasing people on this subject for 7 years is telling.

Even if you could convince us that this is not yet another angry hongkonger unhappy with Chinese abuse of human rights but the same person you'll still will be on the wrong side of history.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1. This are all subreddits from the r/all which mean all redditors go there except maybe r/chinareddit but china is a big country so why not. 

2. This is what is called circumstantial evidence. We can go with that as far as we treat it accordingly. 

3. How "Banned from /r/LifeProTips for mentioning Taiwan" title has the same format as "Despite evidence to the contrary /r/TheoryOfReddit moderators deny pro-China censorship on reddit, then lock the thread". The only thing that links them is alleged anti china rethoric. 

4. Multiple accounts per se isn't violation of any rule so it's a fair point and the only way to fight any censorship. Still can we see where he claimed it in this account?

5. I don't see how this proves anything. Why wouldn't you complain about being censorshiped?

6. Or maybe you just targeting a persecuted ones. I fail to see how this add weight as no sane person will look it up. 

7. Tons of angry idiots post anti-trump stuff and some farm karma with doggos. So?

8. Can we at last see what a "filth" rasist stuff u/The_Gramscian spread?

To sum up: you have a time zone and anti China rethoric for justification – that's exactly what a Chinese censors would rely on.</div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Once I made a post about mass stabbing in finish school on r/worldnews it was flared as "not appropriate subreddit". 

Since then I've seen a drastic drop in responses to my comments and posts on several subreddits including for example r/unpopularopinion. 

So I checked. They didn't appeare anywhere in new posts. In some subreddits only I could see my posts and comments. In others they were available only by direct link. Other shadowbanned my posts but not comments. 

I've never violated any rules of Reddit itself, r/worldnews or god forbid any other subreddit nor did I received any notifications on that matter. 

Once I've read a post about a guy who was shadowbanned but that happened as soon as he registered on Reddit. So he wrote to support and it was fixed. 

As this happened to me immediately after the fore mentioned incident I don't concider that as a glitch. I wrote to mods of some subreddits and never got any response. I don't know how to write to reddit's support so here I'm. 

Keep looking that feature may be somewhere out there... or maybe that's an exclusive feature for native subreddits.</div>
