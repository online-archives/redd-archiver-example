It is like the worst of reddit, *friend.* You aren't uncensored news, you are incels that cherry pick the rules and let mods fly freely while you ban users for doing for less.

Oh and keep going after you said you'll stop just because your ego requires it. Do it. It doesn't change how racist or how shitty you are nor will it fill that gaping hole in you where your civility is supposed to be.</div>

Under your interpretation of the rules, not what your rules actually say. Nowhere on this site or on this planet is calling blacks a bunch of monkeys and niggers *not* disruptive. You are a truly shitty fucking person.

&gt; his post did not interrupt any discussion.

Yes. He did. There was no reason for his post other than to launch attacks and disrupt civil discourse.

&gt; his post did not argue on the sole basis of ad hominems.

It didn't argue at all. He just spewed ad hominems as an argument.

&gt; his post did not dig for dirt through someones post history.

Never said it did.

&gt; his post did not name call ideas

Oh I see, you are going through the *examples* of what you have listed that can be "behavior that seeks to interrupt rather than further the discussion". Your examples, which he still broke, are just examples, by virtue of your own rules: "This is behavior that seeks to interrupt rather than further the discussion, **including:**"

Disruptive behavior is not even limited to just the examples you list. Although he does seek to interrupt *rather than further the discussion.* Or was the discussion of that thread to talk about how blacks are monkeys and niggers? The fuck outta here.

&gt; so how is it disruptive? it is a very basic rule which i've just broken down for you.

And twisted to interpret it how you want, rather than clearly realizing that calling blacks monkeys and niggers is fucking disruptive and awful. And from a mod no less.

&gt; these examples are there on purpose, because "disruptive behaviour" itself is a vague rule so it's clarified.

It is vague and clarification is nice. But if you think there is any argument that can magically turn his comments into something NOT disruptive, you are just lying. Period. You apply the rules differently to mods based on how you feel about the comments, not based on the rules themselves.

&gt; what here do you not understand?

Nothing. I understand the situation perfectly. You banned a user for being disruptive and were right to do so. You then decide to not ban a mod who was being disruptive because you are a happy racist who sticks up for his buddy.

I understand just fine. What I don't understand is why you think trying to argue how calling blacks monkeys and niggers is not disruptive and bannable under your rules...especially after you decided not to argue further.

You clearly aren't going to get past your cognitive dissonance or deliberate corruptive mod practices, whichever it may be. You clearly aren't going to convince anyone that a mod who objectively broke the rules somehow didn't break the rules.

We aren't here to debate anymore. We are here solely to show everyone just how shitty you are both as a person and as a mod and as a sub.

shoo fly.</div>

Yes. He did.

&gt; being provocative isn't disruptive

Being intentionally provocative without being constructive in any way is literally being disruptive. And you know this. If I ran into a bar and shouted niggers and ran out, that is being disruptive. Literally what you mod did.

&gt; i'm not going to argue this any further, because you don't have a clear grasp of the disruptive comment rule.

Oh I have a clear grasp of a very basic rule that you want to twist and warp into letting you banhammer others while not applying nearly the same enforcement on your own moderators.

You are a joke. That sub is a joke. And you know this. And no one is buying the bullshit you are trying to peddle here. So ya, stop arguing against a clear violation of the rules. You don't have a clear grasp on reality if you honestly think your mods behavior was anything *but* disruptive.</div>

Yep. And your mod broke them. Objectively and clearly.

&gt; i'm pretty sure the mod teams view of our rules is correct, considering we wrote them. 

Not how that works. You just choose to interpret them so that your mod team can act with impunity.

&gt; we do not ban people for political opinions

Never said you did.

&gt; or for merely saying a slur

Never said you did.

&gt; calling black people niggers isnt disruptive

It is. Especially in the context of that quote. It is highly disruptive.

&gt; it's intentionally provocative

And without actually contributing to the debate, being intentionally provocative is just a synonym for ...wait for it...being fucking disruptive.

&gt; theres a fine line between being offensive and breaking our comment rules

Aka you get to interpret the rules however you want so that your mods can break the rules by *leaping across any lines* and saying the inexcusably nasty shit he said. 

&gt; which ramblinrambo has not crossed

He fucking sprinted past the line.

&gt; you are perfectly entitled to your opinion

We are beyond opinion. Based on your own rules as you wrote them, your mod objectively broke them. 

&gt;  but rambo will remain a moderator.

No fucking shit he will. Which is why your sub is a fucking laughing stock</div>

&gt; yet you highlighted the part of the rules referring to namecalling during a debate, which he was not in. it was a singular comment.

He still namecalled. Not calling the person he was directly replying to does not mean he wasn't name calling. Calling people monkeys and niggers *is by definition namecalling.* Not a debatable point yet you continue to debate it.

&gt; he wasn't debating anyone or any ideas.

No, he was just being intentionally disruptive.

&gt; as far as i can recall the comment had 11 points. what did it interrupt? there was no reason for that comment to not be there.

Are you seriously telling me upvotes count as evidence of not being disruptive now?

&gt; that abider by the rules being ramblinrambo.

Fucking lel.

&gt; his comment didn't disrupt anything. it didn't break any rules.

Yes it did and yes he did. Objectively. You just look the other way because of either deliberate assholeishness, or severe cognitive dissonance. 

&gt; just because he called black people niggers? who cares?

I think this sums up everything we need. Don't even need to get into the arguably more offensive monkey shit.

Fucking done with you. You've shown everyone that sub's true colors. Ya'll a bunch of fucking racists.

Never said it was.

&gt; it had no ad hominems

Calling people niggers is an ad hominem. Not a debatable point.

&gt; therefore his comment was not disruptive

Not only was it an ad hominem, but it was disruptive regardless of that fact. The behavior was seeking to interrupt rather than further the discussion. Calling people monkeys and niggers does not *further the discussion* 

&gt; tdm's comment on the other hand namecalled users of the sub (specifically referring to them), whined about the subreddit and it's userbase without being constructive

Why are you arguing for his ban? I already told you the dumbass manchild should have been banned.

&gt; these are the two key differences between the banned user and our moderator.

Again, your moderator and this man child should both be removed.

If you *honestly* think saying "Well act like monkey and you'll be treated with the same respect as a monkey. Niggers never learn." is not disruptive, then your cognitive dissonance is so fucking off the walls that I can honestly see why OP was as whiney as he was. Still ban his ass, but holy shit that is some seriously mind boggling levels of retardation to not see that as grounds for mod removal.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; Disruptive behaviour. **This is behavior that seeks to interrupt rather than further the discussion**, including: **arguing on the sole basis of ad hominems**, digging for 'dirt' through someone's post history, **name-calling ideas rather than arguing against them** (e.g. "shut up commie" or "this is racist") and whining about the sub reddit and its user-base without being constructive or with the sole aim to disrupt.

If you think "Well act like monkey and you'll be treated with the same respect as a monkey. Niggers never learn." is NOT disruptive fucking behavior, especially when coming from a moderator of the sub, then holy shit that is some insane levels of cognitive dissonance.</div>

Mate, this idiot should have been banned. But you have a mod doing the **exact** same shit and you aren't doing a damn thing about it apparently. Get your house in order and remove that fucking mod.</div>

hypocrisy doesn't mean you were wronged for being banned. At all. 

Mod should be removed and you should have been banned. Period. Hypocrisy doesn't even factor in to your ban.

&gt; and it is you that are the twat.

The ole "I'm rubber and you're glue" strategy. That'll show me your maturity.
