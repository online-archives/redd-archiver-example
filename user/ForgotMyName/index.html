Frameworks, tools, methodologies, etc can all go from hot to not in a year, easily. So, the platform, the environment, the tools, the languages, and frameworks, and the trends all change constantly. It's a never ending fight to keep up. You could write a new project every 6 months using a completely different stack.</p></div>

<p>I hope someone in the comments goes off on him for spelling &quot;apologize&quot; wrong. (Though I suppose the Brits spell it with an &quot;s&quot;, which would still make it - &quot;apologise&quot;.) </p>
<p>Do you know what the proper response to someone not appreciating your <em>free</em> software is? &quot;FUCK OFF.&quot; If they're right, and there is an issue, make a new issue that only includes technical details and tell them to fuck off in theirs and close it. Done. There always have been, and always will be, asshats in the world.</p></div>

<p>I do agree about their growth though. Good devs will learn and get better pretty quickly. You show them something once or twice and they get it. Other people can get their hand held for months and never go anywhere. You're showing them the same things over and over. Programming isn't for them.</p></div>

You think your plan is better? Then you'd better have hard numbers or some seriously solid reasoning to justify using it over someone else's method. I'm not saying women are incapable of this, but they tend to make emotional arguments. Those simply will not fly when you're talking about compiler optimization, database scaling, host replication, etc. </p>
<p>Having said that, I've worked with some great women in the industry and they've understood this. I have a feeling that the same people that are making emotional pleas for &quot;more women in STEM&quot; would not understand this. </p></div>

<p>Don't even get me started on ancient locked threads on SO that only apply to old versions of something and every time someone asks about a new version their question is just marked as a dupe and trashed. </p>
<p>Regardless, it seems that this dev's final straw was that Microsoft wouldn't push their app because it competed with Microsoft's own app. Now they're jumping over to Apple? Have they never heard of the problems devs on iOS have had with Apple stealing their app's functionality and then removing them from the marketplace? <em>All</em> of these walled gardens suck. </p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>A lot of what you're talking about has nothing to do with SCRUM or Agile. E.g. - Whether the code that a team creates is understandable and maintainable. If you don't understand why abstraction is valuable I question your understanding of development in general. I'm not saying this to belittle you but to inform others that are reading what you're writing and taking it as gospel. </p>
<p>SCRUM/Agile are just tools. Like any tool, they can be misused by morons and you'll end up with poor results. I've worked on teams small and large on SCRUM and waterfall projects alike and I have seen SCRUM be very successful when properly implemented. </p>
<p>As to your comparison contest - One person will always out-code a team if that team is composed of poor developers. Even if there are 50% rock stars and 50% idiots the team will still lose. The good devs will spend all of their time cleaning up after the bad devs. This is why some companies are extremely aggressive about hiring &quot;the best&quot;. Bad developers aren't just slow, they are cancer. They actively hinder the rest of the team's progress. </p>
<p>TL;DR - If your life is crap it's because you are stuck with crap management and crap devs. Find a new place to work and pray that things are better there (spoiler: they probably won't be).</p></div>

Rather than spend a little now, they allow it to go on until it's so bad that the only apparent answer is &quot;rewrite&quot;. So they get a loan or throw the last of their cash at the problem but mismanage the rewrite as well. Then the whole thing just disappears into the inky depths of the ocean. </p></div>

I decided that abstracting my tests made way more sense with respect to maintaining them than some concern about others using them to understand the API. That's what proper documentation and code examples are for. The ability for <em>some</em> tests to double as examples is handy but it shouldn't be done at the expense of maintainable test code. </p></div>

If you're part of a team and you're working on good sized projects, you're inevitably going to end up building and using your own frameworks/utilities. It's stupid to keep doing things over and over. DRY is one of the most fundamental facets of programming. Yes it limits creativity but it does that in order to improve productivity and consistency.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The complexity of front end work is determined by your level of seniority and what kind of work the company does. I've written entire validation frameworks for the front end. The work ended up being pretty complex. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect front end devs to have some basic algorithm knowledge. A depth first traversal is trivial, you do that kind of thing regularly.</p>
<p>Even so, interviews aren't just a test of knowledge, but of personality. It's about learning - How does this person approach problems they're unfamiliar with? How will they respond when they <em>don't</em> have the answer memorized? I'd rather watch someone struggle to think something through and then finally admit - &quot;I'm not really sure, I think I'm close but I'd have to ask around or do some googling at this point.&quot; Rather than throw their hands up and whine about algorithm questions in front end interviews. No one is going to hire the latter. </p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>No one cares because they continue to profit without fixing the problems. Today's computer bugs were yesterday's lax safety standards. They were lax because it was expedient and cheap. Companies didn't care about workers losing an arm here or a leg there because overall, they made more money by allowing it. Software quality issues are the exact same thing. Testing costs money, good developers cost money, well done requirements analysis costs money, you get the idea. So, leadership instructs workers to do whatever the minimum is to still get paid and chalk the rest up as &quot;amazing savings&quot; and give themselves a bonus. </p></div>

<p>The stress and pressure is high, you end up working 12+ hour days because any amount of time not working just makes you feel like you are failing yourself</p>

<p>Unfortunately I feel like this is practically unavoidable. I've kept my day job and ended up in the same scenario as you - 12+ hour days only you're at least getting paid for 8 of them. I'm not doing it now, but when I was, it was exhausting. You feel guilty for having a weekend. You try to pace yourself but the mountain of work before you is gigantic and if you're on your own, you know that you're the only one that can chip away at it. Even with a partner I've struggled with this problem.</p></div>

<p>Definitely look into area user groups (MeetUp usually has a bunch). This is an amazing place to network. There will be recruiters. There will be hiring managers there that are networking. There will also be other devs there who may just happen to know about open positions at their companies. I've even seen people advertise open positions at their employer during these meetings. Worst case, you'll learn about something new/cool if it's a good group. </p>
<p>Just being at that group can give you a foot in the door. You're spending your free time learning more about development, and that's a good thing to see in a potential hire. Also, there's nothing wrong with going through a recruiter to get a job. It can be kind of annoying at times but it's a lot better than being unemployed. If you do that go route, make sure you work with a technical recruiter. A generic one is going to be absolutely useless at finding you jobs you're qualified for or would be interested in. </p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I worked on a small team and wrote a tool in Java that maintained, aggregated and indexed a collection of files. </p>
<p>Biggest lesson learned? Bad programmers write bad code and sometimes it's not even salvageable. People like to whine about people like JoelOnSoftware telling managers to only hire rock stars but bad code is a nightmare to deal with. In this case I gave up and rewrote about 1/3 of the application myself out of desperation. I certainly wasn't a rock star at that point (still not) but at least I knew wtf I was doing. </p>
<p>I've run into similar situations since then with basically the same end result - having to entirely rewrite their code. In the most recent instance there were race conditions, no comments, the same variable would be used for multiple things (which frequently didn't match the name of the var), magic strings, magic numbers, long and inexplicable string manipulation blocks, they violated some of the most basic best practices... the whole thing was garbage. </p>
<p>Lesson: Don't be a half-assed developer. Everyone else you ever work with will hate you. You don't have to be a total rock star, but know what you're doing, and if you don't, ask someone else.</p></div>

I hate working with these people. Their code is abysmal. Even if they do manage to learn that something is a best practice, they never learn <em>why</em>. Which makes them incapable of distinguishing real best practices from horrible ideas posted on blogs by other idiots.</p>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>This is not a problem with overloading. This is not a question of performance vs security. This is the person that originally wrote Buffer writing a poor API. </p>
<p>For one thing, it doesn't make sense for <em>every</em> type <em>except</em> Number to result in getting enough memory to hold that thing. Why are you assuming that I'm never going to just want memory to store a number? Writing an API like this in JS where the caller is responsible for handling type issues is fundamentally stupid. When you write an API in JS you do your own, internal typechecking and any other input verification necessary and then you handle the errors yourself. This is just a basic part of writing something that's self-contained. Even in a typed language you still have scenarios where you have to do this - E.g. What do I do when you pass me an array and there are no items in the array but at least one is required for this function?</p>
<p>OP - Your title sucks but it's a good issue to know about. So, thanks?</p></div>

<p>I can understand how one might paint that as an overreaction, but considering the kind of garbage that's happened over on GitHub I completely agree. If you want a professional environment, then behave professionally. Don't go looking for reasons to take offense to things and then derail the whole project because you're too immature to handle standard programming nomenclature. There is work to be done, no one is interested in your imaginary problems.</p></div>

No offense, but PHP is kind of the lowest of the low when it comes to programming. It sounds like you need to invest some time in educating yourself about Java/.NET before you just try to jump into a job with either of those. Otherwise the interview will probably be kind of embarrassing. If those languages are too challenging or different, consider doing more research into front-end languages/frameworks and get a job somewhere doing that (HTML/CSS/JS).</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>A portfolio isn't sufficient. I don't have time to figure out if you actually wrote the code in your portfolio. Even if I've narrowed down the applicant pool to five, I'm not going to go through all of your repos and start googling snippets to see if you just pulled half of this thing from someone else. So, no, a portfolio of any kind doesn't prove you can code. It's certainly nice to see because it gives me things I can ask you about during the interview, but it's not proof.</p>
<p>Having said that, I <em>have</em> found that presenting people with a complex snippet and asking them what it does is just as effective as any code test. It takes <em>much</em> less time, there's a lot less pressure because they aren't coding in front of you, and honestly, we all spend a lot more time reading code than writing it. It also gives them a chance to talk about anything they would do differently to improve the code.</p></div>

<p>Wow. Why didn't the maintainers of the project just close the thread as off-topic and move on? The world is <em>full</em> of bigots and they contribute to many, many projects. Are we going to create a whole new selection process of &quot;pure&quot; people who are qualified to make code contributions? Perhaps we could even have a name for them. How does Aryan sound? Heck, maybe we could even systematically get rid of everyone that doesn't qualify to be a part of our new, pure group of people that are good enough to contribute to projects on Github. </p>
<p>I get the sense that these people have never even had a real job before. Have they never encountered the office lech? The office racist? They nearly always exist and guess what - you work with them anyway. Because that's what you're paid to do. And maybe, if you're lucky, during the course of your working relationship, you can gently steer them onto a better course. Or maybe they're just hopelessly ignorant. Either way, you work with them because you're an adult and this isn't 1st grade. You can't avoid people with &quot;cooties&quot;.</p></div>

<p>One thing to be aware of - there's a strange bug when you create a new, empty repo via their web interface and then try to commit to it via SourceTree (their free source control program) - it fails. I don't remember all the details, its been a while since I made a new repo, but just something to watch out for if you're new. There are workarounds to be found via google.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p><em>sigh</em>, sadly IE actually allows you to prevent sites from downloading any custom fonts whatsoever. (Specifically because of a bug very similar to this that was encountered a few years back). This is a nightmare for web devs. We have things like icon fonts, so when you don't load the font there are no icons on the whole site. Buttons that are just icons? Blank. Super fun. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It's funny to see people still posting about this. It's been so well known for so long. One of JoelOnSoftware's biggest rants is about this topic <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">all the way back in 2000</a>. Yet, sadly, managers continually ignore and pretend like it's not true. Managers that were once programmers themselves somehow manage to flush this simple truth from their brains. It's awful. </p>
<p>My work is constantly pushing group-wide IM. I don't want to be on group-wide IM. 95% of them aren't going to be useful or apply to me. It'll just be constantly bothering me and ruining my focus. The few times I've tried using it I've last about 20 minutes before closing it. </p></div>

Among them - IE's horrible stylesheet limits <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2011/05/14/10164546.aspx">(exhibit A)</a> <a href="http://joshua.perina.com/africa/gambia/fajara/post/internet-explorer-css-file-size-limit">(exhibit B)</a>. </p>
<p>You're doing your best to keep your massive web app modular and you're using different stylesheets for all kinds of controls and modules. One day, some of your styling isn't working. But it's different pieces in different areas that aren't being applied. There's no rhyme or reason to it. Finally you start just mashing styles from one file into another and... behold, it works. So... then you decide aww man, this bug is a nightmare. We have sooo many files. Okay, we'll get around it by just mashing all of them together and serving up a single CSS file. NOPE, there's a limit to the number of rules you can have in a file... and file size too. It's SO fun. So, then you get to spend your time guessing and checking and tinkering until you've found the magic balance between number of files, number of rules, and size of files that makes IE happy. </p>
<p>...and people wonder why Devs hate IE so much that Microsoft is changing the name.</p></div>

So much of programming feels like an infomercial these days - EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT ARCHITECTURE IS WRONG, DO THIS!! I mean, there's always been <em>some</em> element of that, but I feel like web development makes it a weekly thing. </p>
<p>I really enjoyed this author's honest pro/con approach that encourages the reader to determine which direction is best for them on their own project.</p></div>
