There's no point in posting anything unless you're in niche subreddits.

Because we don't know what those numbers are. We do know the documented numbers. Using those numbers I can easily arrive at 99% survival rate.

How would it be 99.6% (a case fatality rate of .4%)?

How?

Oh because...

&gt;the true number of infections is **much larger** than just the documented cases

So, I just stopped at *equal* to the number of documented cases. X + X = 2X

2*X=1.8

X = 1.8/2

X = 0.9

A case fatality rate of 0.9 is a 99% survivability rate.

&gt;the true number of infections is **much larger** than just the documented cases

&gt;the true number of infections is **much larger** than just the documented cases

I readily admit it may not be 99% on the button, but I can easily claim *it's at least* 99% based on the information provided, which is what I did. 

&gt;Me: If the true number of infections is much larger than the DOCUMENTED cases which already have a survival rate of 98.2%, then I'm going to have no problem saying 99% survival rate.

If anything I was being conservative and favoring a worse survivability rate than the AP implies exists. cc u/sliplover</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're dumb as a fucking brick.

&gt;If the survivability rate of COVID is 98% according to the AP, and there are X number of documented cases, but also there are at least the same number of undocumented cases that were survived. What is the absolute minimum survivability rate?

It doesn't matter what X is. 

34.3 million. 43.4 million. 100 million. 

The answer is still 99%. You're too dumb to understand why. 

&gt;What you say the article says and what the article actually says are two different things and that is misinformation

I'm directly quoting the article. The articles says not to say any one persons chances are 99%. I'm not doing that. An 80 year old does not have a 99% survivability rate. I never claimed that, nor will I ever.

&gt;THE FACTS: As of July 23, there were more than 34.3 million known cases of COVID-19 in the United States and 610,370 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That means the case fatality ratio -- or the portion of known cases that result in death in the country -- is 1.8%. In other words, on average, 98.2% of known COVID-19 patients in the U.S. survive. Because the true number of infections is much larger than just the documented cases, the actual survival rate of all COVID-19 infections is even higher than 98.2%.

If the case fatality rate for COVID according to the AP is 1.8%, and there are X number of documented cases, but also AP says there are *at least* the same number of undocumented cases that were survived. What is the absolute maximum case fatality rate? 

Basic first semester algebra:

2*X=1.8

X = 1.8/2

X = 0.9

Answer. 0.9% case fatality rate. 

In other words, 99% survivability rate.

I'm not misrepresenting anything, you're just a dunce.</div>
