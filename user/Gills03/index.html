    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh and by FAR the worst talking pointers( I call them parrots as they repeat things they don't understand) I have ever dealt with in my life are conservatives and progressive liberals.  Right now there is a growing "democracy is bad" right-wing talking point that's growing and growing.  I cannot tell you how many of them I have had to explain that the US is a democracy that functions as a Republic. It's insane. Anyone who says "Its a Republic not a Democracy" is using talking points they clearly don't understand.  


Saying the left is winning any war is laughable..... its a race to out stupid one another.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Okay go do an experiment and go to what you consider a moderate right wing sub, start saying things they disagree with, see what happens. Im telling you I am the definition of politically moderate, I will talk to anyone about anything, I promise you, you will eat those words.  


What you are experiencing is the product of ideology and you will experience it everywhere as a conservative. I am not going to go into an entire ideology lecture but when it comes to collectivism the left is almost always going to beat the right.  Individualism is an inherent right-wing ideology.  Understanding that will help you realize why you are perceiving them as being a majority.  They are not.   


Reactionary vs radical, the individual vs the masses. When pressed right wingers group up, when pressed left wingers individualize.  None of this is new.  Humans like to get into groups and not like other groups. Its the same thing but just presents different. Like nationalism vs communism. They are both forms of collectivism, they have all kinds of similarities.  Understanding all this shit helps see the forest for the trees.</div>

They totally planned on people like you though lol it’s why the country isn’t run on political tribalist hot takes</div>
