    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">But they're not censoring viewpoints.  The viewpoints of TD were crammed down the throats of All leading up to the elections, with no repercussions.  That's because they weren't being censored.  They're being made to follow rules that, yes, were put in place because of them.  They were brigading other subs by linking to them, and Reddit made a rule against that.  If they weren't being such gigantic dicks about everything, that rule wouldn't need to have been made.  And the other subs that they enforced that rule on, actually followed it.</div>

I'll see you in 36-48 hours when you can think of something you think is clever to say.  Something like this, perhaps:

&gt;HAHAHA I can't attack the librul with any facts or substance so I'll seize upon that question mark!  Checkmate, librul!!!!!!!!!!

Your 10,000 number is meaningless.  90,000 people voted for Osoff, who raised 8 million dollars for a *special election* that people don't usually give a fuck about.

There's a special race in fucking Montana where the polls have narrowed to a single digit lead for the republican, where your orange God emperor carried the state by 20 points.  They even had to send Pence and one of the little trump trolls to campaign because it's being fucked up so bad.

People all over cant stand what Trump is doing (or not doing), so you're going to see a lot of blue in 2018, gerrymandering or not.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Most of those donations came from national donors.

And I won't argue with your point that the liberal ideology is dying, because you made no point, you provided no evidence to back up your thesis.  You just spouted your opinion on something, which I'm not going to argue with.  If I did, it would be tantamount to saying "nuh uh!" and what's the point of that?

If you want to have a real discussion and provide some evidence to back up your claim, then I'm game.  

For instance, I could point out that Democrats have won a majority of total votes in the past few Senate, House, and Presidential elections, but the way things as divided it has led to less elected officials from that party.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The problem is that you're associating this with a regular House race, which it's not.  Historically, no one gives a flying fuck about special elections, and voter turnout is minuscule.  Most of the American population, Democrats and Republicans, don't even know it's happening.  When the vote is nationwide in 2018, you will see a huge turnout.

And we already have the results of the first round of this election to prove you completely wrong.  Osoff already got 92,000 votes out of the 192k that voted.  So your 10,000 number of people who donated in-state is meaningless.  The votes will be there, even if Osoff doesn't win, to get him this close in such a red district shows where Democrats are.</div>

And 2016 was never supposed to be a "wave."  The republicans were always polling to keep the House and Senate.  And the "calculus" as you call it, was actually pretty accurate when it said Hillary would win by a couple of percentage points, it just didn't factor in 80,000 voters in three states that flipped the EC.</div>
