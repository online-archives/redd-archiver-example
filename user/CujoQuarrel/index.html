    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>You have to use sneakernet as I said it's not very flexible. I'd also say it's more like a book cypher than a one-time pad unless you did only use each character once. Since I'd say your messages would be so small compared to the 'book' any repeats would happen so irregularly that you would not be able to use frequency methods. Lets face it with 4 billion characters and messages of about 1k I don't think repeats would be likely. </p>
<p>Generating the pad/book has to be random. One of the best I've seen is the way TrueCrypt/Veracrypt does it using random mouse moves. i'd say that that is pretty much random since even if you tried you couldn't repeat the EXACT same mouse gestures. If you aren't familiar with their method you move the mouse all over the screen for several minutes and it uses that as the seed for the generator.</p>
<p>If you were a spy you'd carry your 'key' on a micro SD card till you got into the targeted country. If you got caught infiltrating the country you'd not send the 'I'm OK' back to tell your compatriots that it's safe to send you messages. The messages you receive should be small with things that you are supposed to preform. To get the message to you it could be posted somewhere that you and they know like some obscure web site message boards , like VOAT, that almost no one reads at some fixed time. Or some cat themed message board . Etc.</p>
<p>You could add other obfuscations to the message if you wanted like an offset that is dependent on some other factor such as date but I doubt that it would be needed.</p>
<p>What do other systems use to encode a message where you don't have some form of sneaker net? Since anything sent electronically is vulnerable how to you get the key/decoder to the other party? </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>BTW there is a simple absolutely unbreakable cipher that has been around since forever. Book ciphers.</p>
<p>I wrote a Python version once to learn Python. You make a huge (mine was 4gb) file of random data. Copy it and put it on two computers. To encrypt some text you pick an arbitrary place in the file and search forward from this spot to find an instance of the letter to encrypt (like 'A') . Record the offset is some manner. Continue with the rest of your document and you will end up with a translation of your document to offsets. </p>
<p>Take the file of offsets to the other computer and do the process in reverse (look up the letter at the given offset). </p>
<p>Since there are only two copies of the file in existence the message is absolutely unreadable except by the sender and receiver. There is no form of analysis that can be used to map the offset to a letter since there will be 4,000,000,000,000 (using my 4gb file) different characters representing the 8-bit (one byte) encoded characters. That means approximately 4,000,000,000,000 / 256 symbols representing 'A'. You would be unlikely to ever use the same offset to represent the same letter.</p>
<p>It's absolutely secure but not very flexible.</p></div>
