Advice you'd do well to take, yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; There are options for anyone regardless of your income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Defeating you in an argument (twice now) is not a sign that I need any kind of "help."

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The repetitive circular nature of your blogs and websites is not normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just set up a few blogs which I now intend to use. Yes, they link together. As for why that's supposed to be an issue, I don't know and I don't think that you do, either. What was that old saying?

"If you can't wow them with substance, baffle them with bullsh\*\*."

That's what you've been doing. You're a vindictive troll with nothing of value to add to this or any other discussion, who has wasted my evening with innuendo and head games, because you weren't man enough to handle the fact that you lost an argument. You're a pathetic, bigoted excuse for a human being.

I am thankful that you are not a relative of mine. If you were, I'd always wonder where we had gone so wrong. I pity your parents.</div>

&gt;This person has an innumerable network of shitty blogs and tumblrs 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;which are all interconnected and give away a shocking amount of personal information.

&amp;#x200B;

They really don't. If you read my blogs, you're going to learn very little about me.  That's by design. You'll see some photography, a few op eds, things like that. The most you will learn is that I live in Chicago, proper, like 2.7 million other people, and that I'm a Jewish grad student in Math. Where in Chicago, I never say. No personal photos, no comments about my family, etc. etc.

But notice how he has responded to reasonable criticism, first of what he said scientifically, and then of his out of control behavior afterwards: with a barely veiled threat of stalking, with support for racial abuse, and with an attempt to abuse the complaint system on Reddit by using it as a tool of personal revenge.

This is disgusting behavior on his part.</div>

&gt;:  I [Doesn't like antisemites](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiSemitismInReddit/comments/lg6ff3/this_post_was_praising_the_oppression_of_jews/gmsycl1/?context=3), another [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiSemitismInReddit/comments/lsw6yu/risraelpalestine_antisemite_says_that_judaism_is/govl9re/?context=3) 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, we've seen u / OmicronCeti try to act as if the fact of my Jewishness was a damaging revelation and it was, for him. When one of his "arguments" is

"Hey, you all know the guys is a Jew, right?"

there's nothing subtle about his anti-Semitism. Now, we have him pointing to the discovery that Bear doesn't approve of anti-Semitism in much the same tone, acting as if it was a great piece of dirt he just dug up.

The reality is that outside of some echo chambers on the social web, most Americans really don't like Nazis very much, and Chicagoans typically like them less than most Americans do. Opposition to anti-Semitism is the rule, not the exception, just like opposition to racism, misogyny, homophobia, and any number of other forms of bigotry. Support for the freedom to say ignorant, hateful things isn't the same thing as support for the ignorance or the Hate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This why you'll see [/u/bear\_in\_exile](https://www.reddit.com/u/bear_in_exile/) show up to [defend poor little /u/minimal\_art](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/ln0b73/better_not_talk_about_it_one_of_the_latest_scary/gnymt7k/?context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Follow the link and you'll see something damning, to be sure: it casts u / OmicronCeti in a very bad light. u / minimal\_art reports a history of "pretextual harassment" on Twitter that goes back a few years, to a time when a time when he was "dogpiled" by some of the Nazis on Twitter. Even since then, he has been getting locked out without cause, most recently just for logging into his account. He mentioned the incident, and then got slurred.

&amp;#x200B;

That wasn't a discussion. That was just racial abuse. It was ugly, stupid, shameful behavior, but take a good look: counting u / OmicronCeti, we're looking at a grand total of four members for the local Hitler fan club. They're the lunatic fringe, not the norm.

Finding somebody who is opposed to their Hate in Chicago is about as surprising as finding somebody who isn't a fan of Saddam Hussein in a VFW meeting. That's the norm. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By now, I think I'm made my point. I also think that OC has wasted more than enough of my time with his derangement. I will say that I find it a little troubling that when somebody like OC or the people in that other discussion show up, that the people in this sub get so quietly, so quickly.

Are you all really that scared of crazy people?</div>

What an interestingly judgmental comment about about my posting history to see come out of the moderator for r/Areology. You're running a subreddit about the geology of Mars. 

r/TheLiveOn is another subreddit about Mars. You see two people posting to a discussion on your sub. Then, after you decide to go dig up some dirt on me in order to get even with me for the fact that I showed you up in an argument, you point to the fact that we both showed in another subreddit that happened to be about Mars and act like that fact is damningly meaningful.

People who read one subreddit about a particular subject are likely to read other subreddits about the same subject, especially when the first subreddit is being modded by an abusive, psychotic man-child who cyberstalks and drives off his own membership. What's next? Are you going to try to dox me?

That having been said, let's take a look at my history on r/theliveon. Here it is: I posted a comment explaining why trying to make Mars into a second Earth was probably not a good idea, even in theory

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping\_mars\_or\_transform\_it\_not\_terraforming/gpc9gbe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping_mars_or_transform_it_not_terraforming/gpc9gbe/)

along with a short continuation 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping\_mars\_or\_transform\_it\_not\_terraforming/gpt7qqp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping_mars_or_transform_it_not_terraforming/gpt7qqp/)

that linked to another comment on another subreddit

[https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/lwf0go/atmosphere\_on\_mars/gpt6m60/](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/lwf0go/atmosphere_on_mars/gpt6m60/)

in which I explained why one could solve the problems I mentioned by just using less air.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I posted there once, posting one comment followed by a link to a comment of mine somewhere else, and never posted there, again. How does that qualify as "being active" on that subreddit? Of course, it doesn't and you know it doesn't. Your hope seems to be that by acting like an aggressive lunatic, you're going to intimidate those reading this into going along with what you have to say.

Is this the sort of behavior that one should expect to see out of a moderator, or even out of a functioning adult?</div>

&gt; C [Active in /r/RussianFood](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how_to_use_cold_smoked_mackerel/gpccwb5/) 

&amp;#x200B;

To be exact, I posted there once. That hardly qualifies as being "active" on a subreddit. While browsing Bear's profile, I saw that a legitimate comment he posted had been censored, and said something about the mod abuse. That comment can be found at

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how\_to\_use\_cold\_smoked\_mackerel/gpccwb5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how_to_use_cold_smoked_mackerel/gpccwb5/)

Let's take a look at what I said, in its entirety.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Going to u / bear-in-exile's profile, I see a comment about curing through the use of cold smoking being a form of preservation, not one of cooking, one that prevents spoilage but doesn't do anything to get rid of parasites.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1393/pdf/circ1393.pdf](https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1393/pdf/circ1393.pdf)  
&gt;  
&gt;His comment is accurate, yet, when I come into this subreddit, I don't see it. One of the mods must have removed it. This is not acceptable. Correct information about a health risk should not be responded to with censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The quote above is the sum total of all that I've ever posted to the Russian Food subreddit.

Follow the link to the government website. Everything I've said is correct, yet you have the nerve to act as if there was something damaging to be found in the fact that I posted that comment. This is a continuing pattern of behavior with you. You have repeatedly taken the position that a user who does a fact check and a provides a link to relevant documentation has committed an offense which he must be confronted over. This is the pattern of somebody who is flying into a narcissistic rage.

Let us note that you then tried to amplify what was not merely a weak argument, but a psychotic one, by describing the same post twice. First you referred to it as a time I supported Bear, and you referred to it as my history of being active on a subreddit focused on food I can't eat. Russian food is not particularly kosher. 

&amp;#x200B;

What else did you claim?

 

&gt;Very similar username

&amp;#x200B;

Because we both use punctuation. Impressive 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[4th comment ever is about /u/bear-in-exile](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how_to_use_cold_smoked_mackerel/gpccwb5/)  
&gt;  
&gt;[6th comment ever is in a month old thread /u/bear-in-exile was banned for](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gpchg8j/)

&amp;#x200B;

Not a coincidence. I see stupid stuff on the Internet every day, like everybody else, but what you posted stood out. You said  that fossils would be killed by radiation, and that only organisms with bones could leave fossils behind. After I provided you with three classes of counterexamples to your claim (plants, insects and jellyfish) and links documenting the fact that you were wrong, and watched you throw that starting mini-tantrum, I had no trouble knowing who the voice of reason was in that discussion. I start browsing his profile, to see if I could find anything interesting on it.

I would have browsed yours, but I've never been a fan of copypasta.

Bear has been on this site since the lockdowns began, and found his way into more than a few fights. Out of all of those, the only one I've supported him in is the one that I just mentioned. I did so for the same reason I helped out the guy in r/Twitter, who isn't me, either. Because right is right and wrong is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The sequence:  
&gt;  
&gt;[/u/bear-in-exile](https://www.reddit.com/u/bear-in-exile/) was banned.  
&gt;  
&gt;They make a new alt and immediately try to back themselves up.  
&gt;  
&gt;They are found out and banned again, and reported to the admins for ban evasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Your theory is that I'm Bear's sock puppet, that he invented me in order to get back into your subreddit? Just one problem with that theory, aside from the fact that I've been running groups on Flickr with thousands of members since I was a tween, which would make me too time consuming an identity to fake. The problem is that I have tweets going back to 2009, and Bear's run-in with you happened this year. Your position, then, is that Bear knew what you were going to do 12 years before you did it, and he invented me to give himself cover for a fight, 12 years in advance?

Do I really have to explain to you why that sounds crazy?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I actually unblocked this clown in order to respond to his latest bout of abuse. I believe that what I am looking at is known as a "gish gallop." The idea is to bury the person one is responding to in so many specious arguments, that he doesn't have time to respond to them all. But, I'll see what I can do.

&gt; [/u/the\_very\_least](https://www.reddit.com/u/the_very_least/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Very similar username

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously? How is "the\_very\_least" similar to "bear-in-exile"? The use of punctuation to separate the words? I don't believe that I invented that. But if so, I've been a busy boy. Just count the number of active blogs, groups and websites that have hyphens and underscores in their urls, all of which would seem to have been created and run by me. Oh, however do I find the time?

&gt; B [Math grad student (but no publications...)](https://i.imgur.com/Yh9iFkl.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

As anybody who has actually been in graduate school knows, one doesn't generally get published until after one has defended one's thesis, and is no longer in graduate school. An already granted PhD is a minimal requirement for the publication of research, so this supposed distinction that you point to is one that I share with everybody who (unlike you) really is a graduate student in a STEM subject.

We're a small segment of the population, but we're not that small. There's certainly more than one of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; E [Lives in the Chicago area](https://i.imgur.com/ccftmb8.png), another [example](https://i.imgur.com/kVhI9Uq.png), also in their twitter bio. 

&amp;#x200B;

Along with [over 9 million](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/news/chicago-still-losing-population) of my closest friends. In case you haven't heard, Chicago is a very large city and home to more than one PhD granting institution. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  A Interested in math and science. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we are to take you at your word when you speak about your background, you would have those same interests. In case you've forgotten, you've tried to pass yourself off as a second or third year PhD student in Planetology. The last I checked, Planetology was a science, a branch of Astronomy to be exact.

Therefore, by your logic, we're the same person. Fascinating.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Links to [twitter](https://i.imgur.com/IlfzBcC.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at how that came up, and just what an incredible s\*\*theel you are. Somebody [reported being locked out of his Twitter accoun](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/m1sd30/locked_out_of_hacked_account/)t, which had been hacked. He was running into a problem of poor planning on Twitter's part. Since the hacker changed his account's contact email address, the system would not let him report the hacking. I attempted to help him, by posting a message about his post, directing it to Twitter support, and giving them a link back to his problem report here on Reddit. [I then told him about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/m1sd30/locked_out_of_hacked_account/gqhuojx/). Assuming that the user is a he. If I'm misgendering this individual, I apologize.

So far, we have you trying to make use of my effort to help out somebody who was in a bad situation in an attempt to throw some mud in my direction and see if it would stick, but this gets better.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; [/u/minimal\_art](https://www.reddit.com/u/minimal_art/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Another alt. Happens to the the twitter [/u/the\_very\_least](https://www.reddit.com/u/the_very_least/) linked to..., AKA u/_waterscapes_ as well)

&amp;#x200B;

No, that's not the account on Twitter I linked to. I linked to minimal\_arts on Twitter, not to \_waterscapes\_. Let us note that I have not edited that comment.

You lied.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; G [Crossposts everything to their own page](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_very_least/) 

&amp;#x200B;

Not even close. Every once in a while, I crosspost a video or a picture I think looks nice. Who doesn't?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; H [Refuses to use /r/ or /u/ correctly in writing](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how_to_use_cold_smoked_mackerel/gpccwb5/), or see this very post. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was informed by somebody already on Reddit that direct linking to other subs tends to encourage brigading, and that direct linking to an individual profile is considered a form of harassment under the terms of service. I've seen a number of mods insist that their users refrain from these practices. As I have no desire to antagonize Reddit or create problems for responsible moderators, I saw no reason to not comply with these demands.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I Is [Jewish](https://i.imgur.com/hZ4ExTC.png) so understandably doesn't like antisemites. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I am indeed Jewish. Like 230,000 other Chicagoans. Is that a problem for you? Are you maybe a little bit bigoted? By the way, Jewish mathematicians are about as rare as Jewish lawyers, doctors or agents in show business. We've been "overrepresented" in my own field since the Middle Ages.

&amp;#x200B;

 J ["Centrist with libertarian leanings"](https://i.imgur.com/PTaxQNm.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

No. That's a false quote from [the screenshot you give us](https://i.imgur.com/PTaxQNm.png). Let's take a look at what it actually says about that user's politics.

"Politically Centrist (recovering libertarian)"

That suggests a rejection of libertarianism, not an embrace of it. Note the mocking reference to the phrase "recovering alcoholic." Somebody who called himself a recovering libertarian would be somebody who was embarrassed by his earlier ideology.

I think that I'm about to hit the character limit for a comment, so I'll post this and continue.</div>
