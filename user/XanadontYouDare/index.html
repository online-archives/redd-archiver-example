The act he literally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs act? That's made up? 

> Increasing deficit is not the president, but congress.

So biden has nothing to do with any of the spending during his presidency? Or the tax rates? Or is it just Trump?

>Removing pandemic team is like, sure hindsight is 20/20.

Yea, he removed a team to stick it to the libs, and it bit him in the ass. Just another one of his many fuck ups. 

> If you ask the question on Reddit they will quickly google what their group think response is supposed to be, which is probably what you just did.

huh? What the fuck are you even talking about? Do you really not believe people could come to the conclusion that trump sucks without the help of outside influence?</div>

No, You can definitely change your body. Hormones and surgery are a thing. But you can not change your chromosomes. That is different.

>Identifying as a woman don't make you one.

not biologically, no. No one has been arguing that. You've actually been mistaken this whole time lol.

>Tell me: if you identify as a woman but you have XY chromosomes and a dick, are you a woman?

That's not what's happening. That's entirely your own fantasy that you've created in your own head. That's the sad part. You're all projection lol.

>Nobody cares if you think you are better than the religious. If you think a cracker can't turn into a man without having it's appearance change but a woman somehow can turn into a man without having her appearance change, you are ALSO religious.

I don't think i'm better than the religious. 

>Congrats, today you learned you are religious. Instead of worshipping God, you worship the mutilation of kids and sexual psychosis. Go to jail.

Still not religious, and I support neither lol.

Huh? This has literally nothing to do with disease lol. Neither of them are morally wrong. 

>You are right though, it is immodest and it would be better if nobody wore them either.

What would be better? Your feelings? Should we dictate society based off YOUR feelings? 

>That is whataboutism.

The one logical fallacy you're able to recognize. Unfortunately you're not able to recognize the many you use lmao

>But aside from that, I'd still be upset if I saw a girl in a thong pole dancimg in front of a kid. Why? Because it's pedophilic behavior to get off sexually in front of children.

No one is advocating for stripping in front of children. Pole dancing is not the same thing. 

>If you can't see why sex performers reading to kids is bad, call your local ethics teacher for an emergency ethics lesson before you end up in jail.

Drag queens are not sex performers lmao

>Finally, transgenderism is PSYCHOTIC DELUSION.

I'll listen to the experts, not the schizos. 

>It's not that they are simply picked on.

That is what leads to the depression and suicide, it does not lead to being trans.

>You are calling ME schizophrenic? You think a man can be a woman lmao.

I am not saying that at all, actually. I think there is gender and there is biological sex. Two different things. We could actually debate this if you wanted to, but you don't have it in ya. 

>Men cannot be women. Why? Because the chromosomes are different. It's like saying u are a dog. It's UN REALITY.

A trans person is not saying they have different chromosomes. A trans person is saying their "gender" (which is not tied to chromosomes) is what they feel more comfortable with. Not that they are biologically one or the other.

>Finally, I'm a liberal not a conservative. Classical liberal democrat. It's just that I have a brain.

No you aren't. And clearly haven't done anything to educate yourself on any of these topics with any sort of honesty. So whatever you call yourself doesn't matter, you're dishonest and really bad at forming arguments without resorting to shitty childish insults.</div>

You don't get it, I'm ANTI-religion...

Yea, sure. Anyone who talks about demons on a regular basis gives serious rapist vibes. So keep up the projection. The name is no accident.</div>

Of course they deal with a lot of mental anguish caused by those who are against them. It's a conservative problem, not a transgender problem. 

Dressing in drag is not inherently sexual lmao. I went with my wife to a Star wars themed drag show, it was not sexual, just comedy and a bunch of people wearing more clothes than the average person does. 

Drag queens wearing full dresses piss you off, but going to the pool and seeing straight up thongs isn't a problem?</div>
