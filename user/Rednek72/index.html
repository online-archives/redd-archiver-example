    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So, the base progressive, woke ideology playbook. It's sad to see the road that this has led the US down. The idea that people claim to want a debate but scream and yell as their form of presenting an argument is so unproductive. I joke that I have lost all faith in humanity, but it's becoming more and more of a true statement these days.</div>

I never specifically spoke about the police unless I was responding to someone. I am not under any misconception that police are sworn to protect and serve citizens. They are sworn to uphold and protect the Constitution, or at least that is what many of the Oath of Offices state.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I forgot to add the original post. It was a post about Rep. Lauren Boebert commenting how gun owners should claim their firearms should be reported as lost in a boating accident, and there were a lot of replies and comments with the normal Conservative bad, Don't Tread On Me bad. The first comment I posted spoke simply about the actual meaning of Gadsden, Molon Labe, and the Thin Line flags/stickers. No profane language, Personal attacks or any other violation of Reddit Policy or even the subreddit policies. I was attacked from the outset with what I felt were unwarranted attacks &amp; language. The multiple responses I recieved were not going to be unanswered. When I posted the final, lengthy post to the jsin character that's when I got the "not enough karma" removal. So I then addressed the moderators directly since they allowed those attacks, and I will not be silenced by my critics. I'm not overly upset about being banned, however I feel it was unwarranted for the simple fact that I was "returning fire" to against those attacks.</div>
