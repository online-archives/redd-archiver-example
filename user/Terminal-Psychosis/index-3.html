You can spew all the crapola you want, without any backup, (and there is none, ever, with your type) nobody can take it seriously.

T_D mods got suspended for calling out admins on their blatant hypocrisy.  Not any type of rule breaking.

(rules that other subs break constantly, with full admin complacency, mind you)</div>

They dug their own grave, the hypocritical idiots.

T_D is a fan club for our president.  They recieve constant abuse from every angle, with full admin approval.

Calling out the admins on this hypocracy is what got those mods banned, not in any way breaking the admin's nebulous and selectively enforced "rules".</div>

The admin's SRS powermod darlings get away with so much real-world abuse, let alone just breaking site rules.

There are many, many more.  T_D is subjected to doxxing, threats and bot manipulation constantly, all with full admin complacency.

And when they called the admins out on it, the admins suspended their accounts.  It has noting, whatsoever to do with "broken rules".

It has everything to do with the admins being hypocritical assholes.

They control the site, they can do that if they want, but they can also deal with the reputation they've built for it.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Right,  because T_D follows the rules.

T_D continued, and continues to call out admin hypocracy, because the mountain of abuse they get from other subs and groups, with full admin complacency.

You've seen... yah right bud.  Go ahead, show it to the world. 

You think with all the harrassment they're subjected to, T_D mods would allow anything like that?

No, T_D is simply a fan club for *shock*  Donald Trump. It is that simple, if you like it or not. They should be allowed.

All the shit slinging , actual real-world doxxing and threats you and yours are trying so desperately to attribute to them, come from others *against* them.  Pure projection.

There is real-world proof of this.  You have zero to the contrary, unless you wanna actually back up the constant flow of bullshit.  You can't, and nobody can, because it is all lies.  If there was anything of the sort, the admins would have been ALL over it long ago. 

Truth is, reddit admins got pissed off at being called out on their bullshit, and suspended a few T_D mods for outing them.  No amount of your baseless, non-factual crapola you're talking will ever make it true.

"it's their website!" is your excuse?  yes, admins can do what they want,  and they can fully expect to be called assholes for doing it.  This could easily happen to you and yours, for any number of opinions you hold that the admins do not thing are profitable. 

Diff is, T_D members would be right with you, calling out that crap, While you're trying to shovel even more of the same shit on them.

T_D has followed all the ridiculous special rules admins have shoveled on them,  put up with all sorts of abuse the admins ignore.  And when they said enough is enough, admins suspended them for it.  :(</div>

Revenge for calling out the admins on their blatant hypocrisy.

While T_D was fully complying with an ever increainlgly opressive set of special "rules", as well as site-wide ones,

the admins completely ignored other subs and groups breaking site rules with wild abandon.

A few T_D mods called out the admins on this bullshit, and were quickly suspended for it.

The admins here have proven, once again, they have not one shred of integrity.</div>

No, T_D did not doxx.  They actively discouraged it with extreme prejudice.

T_D mods and posters were *actually* doxxed by other groups and subs though, which the admins consistently ignored.

When called out on such blatant hypocrisy, admins suspended the mods calling them out on their shit.</div>

As OP clearly proves, there is an abundance of evidence of such manipulation from the other side,

and a deafening silence from reddit admins. :-(</div>

Reddit banning the site where POTUS did his AMA would be a public relations nightmare. 

Bad for business.

So the admins simply try to bury it, again and again, with shady software "updates",

while allowing / encouraging actually abusive subs to run amok.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The SRS powermod cabal is constantly on the warpath to take over any decent free speech zone that gets halfway popular.  With full admin approval. :(

This has been going on for years. Especially ramped up after the Elen Pao debockle , and recently, holy shit, political groups such as CTR, and now big papa ShareBlue have completely taken over the major politically based subs.  Not to mention anything that gets decent viewer numbers. :(

remember when /politics use to be a *default*?!?   Even the admins can't allow that anymore, that's how poisoned that place is with the political propaganda industry.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, seriously criticizing dedicated circle-jerk subs is kinda low-hanging fruit.

Well, unless they organize / condone very abusive behavior such as SRS &amp; Co. 

Donno of any major doxxing or brigade campaigns from the latestage sub... though they are obviously related to the SRS mob.  

Best keep our eyes on them.

Sad thing is, other dedicated circle-jerk subs like T_D that follow actual reddit rules 1000% better, are  constantly under attack, from admins and various political groups (hello Shareblue) alike. :/   </div>

Also, they ban people for using phrases like "criminally insane", in case someone might get their feelings hurt.
