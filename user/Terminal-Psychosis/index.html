And the ones  pushing these gene therapy experiments get VERY nasty about it. Even calling for death of anyone not joining the Covid Cult.

These gene therapies do NOTHING to prevent infection. A fully vaxxed person will catch the virus just as easily as anyone else. The drug companies themselves have stated this very clearly. 

All they do is try and keep the symptoms from getting so bad. And it turns out they're not even so great at that. 40% in real life compared to the drug company's original 95% claim.

It is incredibly dangerous to tell people that the vaccines keep them from catching the virus. This turns them into super-spreaders. They will go out sick, thinking it's just a cold, and spread the virus like wildfire.

Of course, they won't say which ones, and have been banning subs that document such forever. :-(

Best check through your favorites.

To be able to participate in a quarantined sub, use a browser to visit the sub. First visit it will ask you if you want to enter.

After answering yes, it's open to you again, and will be visible on apps as well.</div>

Lockdowns have been proven, by peer-reviewed scientific studies, to be ineffective at slowing, let alone stopping the spread of this virus.  All they do is massive damage to people's lives, businesses and entire economies. Promoting them is harmful science denial.

/NNN constantly and consistently made accurate predictions, well ahead of the mainstream,  based on solid science and professional medical opinion. The ones *against* /NNN's accurate information are abusive science deniers. Many of whom are directly working as shills for shady drug companies.</div>

An abusive ban from the admin's rabid leftist SRS mod cabal here and there is NOOO problem. 

Let any sub that is actually speaking about scientific fact go  against their monetary or political agenda though, and they are fully open to abuse and harassment without end. Even with full participation from admins here.

Subs that do not fall in line with the admin's agendas are subjected to nebulous, selectively enforced "rules", without any clear explanation of what such rules are. Endless threats to "conform" without any idea what was done wrong to begin with.

Massive conflict of interest. 

Also, most social media monopolies have been pushing drug company propaganda from the start. 

So yes, absolutely getting paid to lie about. 

Sometimes, so much evidence is exposed they're forced to back off here n there (virus came from the lab in Wuhan, China,

but they're still constantly censoring actual science in favor of profit &amp; politics.</div>

The BLM organization is racist. Supporting them is supporting a racist organization. This does not strengthen your assertion that you are not racist. I believe you, just also believe you are completely misinformed and totally naive about the BLM org.

You're right that /WPT is also incredibly racist and you getting banned there for such a valid and reasonable comment only supports that fact.</div>

They do not help black people or their communities in the least. Not one penny of their millions in donations has gone to anyone but the leaders of the scam organization, and equally corrupt DNC politicians. 

The BLM organization is founded by rabid leftist Marxists. Their entire goal is destruction of America, family values, and they are notoriously racist against people of European &amp; Asian descent. 

The ideology is good, that is self evident. The organization is pure evil, run by selfish, dangerously deranged bigots, liars &amp; scammers.</div>

Rabid leftists / progressives are the opposite. Massively authoritarian and collectivist.  There really is no comparison.

Sad that the moniker "liberal" has been so polluted these days, *falsely* referring to downright Marxist boot lickers. Commies even.

The media completely lied about the circumstances of her death.

In reality, it's come out that the police did knock, repeatedly, but her and her boyfriend refused to answer the door.

When the police broke in the door, the dude shot at them. Of course they  returned fire. She died because her boyfriend was using her as a shield and she got caught in the crossfire. 

It's a sad situation, but nowhere near the lies the media were spreading about her being shot in her sleep or other such complete bullshit.

The hysterectomy crap is just a complete lie with zero evidence, let alone proof. They probably didn't want that one up because it is such an obvious lie it makes them look bad. Not such a big deal.

The Taylor thing though, that is absolutely huge.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Many of their useful idiots are white, but the puppet masters behind it, are not. 

Members of an extremist, cult ideology have no interest in what outsiders are thinking. They are literally trained to stop all logical thought that might threaten their indoctrinated beliefs.

This is how people can be so brutally inhuman, when they believe anyone with a different opinion are on the "wrong side of history". Still feel themselves morally just after committing even the most vicious crimes against their fellow man.

reddit, and other abusive, monopolistic social media sites (twitter, ytube, fbook, etc..) are only interested in pushing such rabid leftist, belief based indoctrination. Stomping out those that might disagree with their political &amp; social agenda.

As this newest ban list, and the blatantly racist new "rules" clearly show. This is nothing new here, but it has gotten so glaringly obvious, that even casual redditors are shocked by the blatant abuse.</div>

The next day /politics turned into the rabid leftist cesspool of propaganda and disinformation it is today. Literally overnight, it became 100% Orange Man Bad bullshit. 

Their cancer has taken over most of the major "politics" and "news" subs. With full admin support and approval. Well hell, they have an ENORMOUS propaganda budget.

And yah, now that the communist Chinese government is reddit's second largest investor, their shills are giving even Shareblue a run for their money. Unfortunately, their agendas are aligned pretty well here, so we get a double-whammy of censorship, disinformation and political harassment.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Admins literally say the rules against racist hate speech only apply for "minorities". They're just fine with hate speech against the "majority" race. It's right there on the new rules they just published.

Obviously they're only considering America, though reddit is used world-wide. I mean, this agenda has been *obvious* for quite a while, but they really do abhor white people, especially conservatives.  Have no problem being racist against black conservatives either, really. But they just put it in black and white, for everyone to read. 

/blackpeopletwitter is still there, btw. The biggest racist hate-sub on the site to date. Go wonder.  :/

And the constant abuse and harassment of T_D, over YEARS,  is so obviously an attempt to manipulate the upcoming elections. Banning t_d now, even though admins killed the sub months ago... 100% political censorship, as are most of those on the list.

Cute they threw in a token tankie sub, that was guilty of FAR, FAR worse hate speech than was ever seen on T_D. And they've let dozens of /CTH quarantine evasion subs live on this entire time.

Reddit is a PUBLISHER, and has zero claim to Safe Harbor protections. They must be held accountable for their treason against America, to normal, conservative citizens, for the real-world damage their publication of hate and harassment has caused, and prosecuted for it, to the fullest extent of the law.</div>

This is a typical Shareblue / rabid leftist propaganda tactic.  Thinking Mr. Hik3r is deliberately trying to derail a valuable and reasonable conversation. 

Again, hard to say with the link they provided being unreadable, and no explanation to the meaning meant.

"socialists" ... or neolibs... they're pushing for massive lockdown, deamonizing any reasonable objections against as insane,

but go on to fully promote mass riots, looting, arson, rape and murder over media hype. 

Laughably, after fully promoting HUGE congregations of people, they are dead set against personal voting, pushing for mail-in ballots that are notoriously prone to massive voter fraud.</div>

Why is that?  Because conservatives bring actually logical, reasonable arguments.

And rabid leftists screech "NAZI!!" at anything they disagree with, try to shut it down. When the forum declines their abusive censorship, they either stay, and are swayed by wisdom and reason... 

or go running away screeching, with their hands over their ears.

This is not a theory, it has been seen again and again all over the internet, and IRL.


---

The entire brutal, terrorist riots Antifa &amp; Co are responsible for, have zero political legitimacy.  They have no reasonable ideas or ideals, they are NOT interested in talking...  only control and shit slinging. With lots of attempted murder thrown in.  This is obvious to anyone that is paying the least attention to their methods.

Look at the cesspool of rabid leftist / Shareblue propaganda that /politics has become here.  All major "politics" and "news" subs are full of such cancer. They allow no dissenting voices. 

There is hardly a place on reddit, facebook, google (Ytube), twitter, etc that allows conservative views.  Rabid leftist cencorshit abounds.  And all the while, they let their darling, rabid leftist subs get away with calls to violence, doxxing, swatting, brigading, on the daily.  Promoting arson, robbing, rape, death and destruction on the ones they disagree with politically. 

You say that both sides are equal.  Sorry, you don't even have a legitimate "side" to the argument. Just blatant propaganda, violence and censorship.  

Show me any forum, on the web or tv / radio, that really allows free speech, that is run by leftists such as Antifa, rad-fem, BLM, etc... There are none. At all.

Such rabid leftist, terrorist authoritarians are directly *opposed* to free speech. For exactly the reasons I've given.</div>

The left is fond of such false flag operations, for the opposite reason. Their demand for "right wing violence" so far outstrips the actual supply, they constantly and consistently try to manufacture their own.</div>

IF it was fake, there would be actual word from Twitter, or some legitimate reporting.  

Of course their terrorist subreddit is going to deny it (while they organize more terrorist riots off-site).

This ONE could be fake, but they're well known for exactly this kind of crap. 

Also tons of ads in the papers before these latest terrorist riots started, offering cash for such terrorist cells. Most of the instigators of the violence and destruction were from out of state too, which is their typical M.O.</div>

They have no legitimate political ideology, so they resort to physical violence and censorship to force their authoritarian control. They are not interested in discussion. They have proven again and again that they have nothing to say. Just calling normal people "Nazis" to dehumanize and excuse their violence. 

There is no comparison to anything on the right today.</div>

No 2 million people died, or are going to die, because of Trump. Quite the opposite. He's saved countless lives because of his fast and  decicive actions. (Dems screaming bloody murder at every step too). 

95% of world-wide infections and deaths are the fault of the communist Chinese government, and their lap-dogs the WHO. And you're not allowed to post about how you want them to die either, though they absolutely should be brought to *justice*. 

You absolutely wished death on an innocent man, and are completely ignoring the REAL perpetrators of this  entire mess. The CCP has blood on their hands. Lay the blame where it belongs, and don't promote death on innocent people because of some ridiculous political indoctrination.

The rules about requiring a source (any source) are pretty selectively enforced to favor leftist bias too. 

Conservative ideas get downvoted to hell, and the most rediculous rabid leftist crap (with source or not) is constantly top comment.

Hardly "neutral" at all.</div>
