I know this post will be down voted half way to the caretaker's array, but that is fine, I have been a Trekkie since the early days of TNG so yes I know Star Trek has always been inclusive, even before it was cool to be so. Also I am by en large socially liberal and am calling for nothing more then what George Floyd's own brother is calling for... Peace.

As soon as I saw the full video of Floyd's murder I like everyone else was disgusted. I knew the cop would be prosecuted because there was no ambiguity about what happened it was murder.

I have to say I had to wait to see the full video because of the medias nasty habit of only giving half the story and using that to rile everyone up and divide us unnecessarily.

Everyone agrees Floyd was murdered Everyone was united in that fact, and now everyone is divided again because rioting and looting are being done not in the name of Floyd, but people taking advantage of his murder.

Every Trekkie should stand up against lawlessness and anarchy, because we all knew someone who lived in a society that was ruled by it, Tasha Yar, Turkana IV, The planet's government began breaking down in the 2330s. Dozens of factions developed, and civil war broke out.

[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Turkana\_IV](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Turkana_IV)

[r/startrek](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/) is being linked to provide bail money for rioters? for looters? seriously? If these were peaceful protesters being arrested for executing their constitutional rights, I would have no problem with that. But some of those arrested are guilty of arson, brick throwing, looting, and general violence. What happens to society in general when we excuse that behavior? again I say ask Tasha Yar.

then to make it even worse then finding out I am all but exiled from the Trekkie community for being against rioting, I am given a link teach me how as a white person to not be racist?</div>
