Okay idk what you're talking about for the rest of your post so I'll address this. I mean the bots wouldn't work on Reddit. The Donald was fueled by real, live people. Bots wouldn't function in this climate, only real people made it happen. Aka the silent majority isn't so silent anymore.</div>

I guess to clarify my point I mean that honestly I think everyone is using bots. And until I see a clear, large-scale pattern of "bots" favoring one side it's ultimately a net-zero. Logically speaking, if both sides spend $5mm on bots, it essentially evens out no?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">To address your first point, yeah definitely. You'd be a fool to claim any political group ever doesn't do sketchy shit. I meant more how reddit/GOP was doing more typical dirt digging while the media/DNC was doing some wayyyy sketchy shit like slanting news and straight up rigging the election against Bernie (not that I like the dude but doesn't matter). 

As to your second point I mean yes, to an extent. I want to win of course. And unlike most people here, I'll admit I'm okay with taking a few shortcuts if the net benefit to America is positive. The thing is, I really do believe Trump will drain the swamp. But part of draining the swamp is transparency, which is something I missed since I didn't get it after our last president immediately sealed his records after taking office.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'll be real, that's kind of sketchy. And I honestly haven't seen that stuff before. But until somebody gives me proof the other side isn't doing that (which they won't because you can't prove that, and r/politics is heavily biased anyway) it's just too hard to say Trump has an upper hand.

To be clear, I'm definitely not saying there isn't bot involvement. But during the election, man we had energy there that you couldn't find anywhere else. There's a reason the donald got banned from the front page. I simply can't chalk that up to bots.

Also, it's worth mentioning that pro-Hillary sources have egregious examples of similar posts.</div>

No I mean it's definitely suspect but when you look into it it's a really far stretch to think Russia fixed the election considering how many avenues you have to go through and Hillary didn't even get elected and the Democrats fixed their primaries (and that we DO know).

Nobody is comfortable with Russia interfering with anything domestic but the fact is like what 17 agencies investigated the Russia connection and found no evidence of collusion? </div>
