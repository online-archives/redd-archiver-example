I'm pointing out that the average person not in the weeds of specifics about Chinese domestic and foreign policy will be significantly less likely to associate Tiennanmen Sq with AKs versus, say, tanks. I'm not against the post or the protest, idk what you think you're arguing here.</div>

So, they leave, vote for the same kinds of policies instead of surveying the political landscape and learning why things work how they do where they do. See: any major metropolitan area in a primarily red state, most notably Austin vs the rest of Texas.

Edit: also wanna add this is a complaint from even other liberals from, for example, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, the list goes on. The trope of "Californians are ruining my state" is 100% a real thing.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Japan didn't lock down- why didn't, say, Tokyo become a covid hotbed if lockdowns are the difference between doing well and doing poorly? There even were cases early on in Japan, why didn't it spiral out of control considering they didn't lock down? Is it possible that other measures are just as effective as a complete and total lockdown while doing significantly less collateral damage? What about South Carolina? No lockdown, experienced cases, is doing MILES better than states that did lock down like for example New York. Is it possible that the lockdown has more downsides than it does upsides considering its effectiveness is demonstrably inconsistent or at the very least reasonable to question?</div>

I agree that  if it had just stayed online and had no greater consequences beyond her directly, that would be her just not being able to handle people. Actually DOING something or pushing for action to be taken simply because you don't like a personal decision they made about their own body is different than just spewing words at someone. Again, I never claimed it was 100% at the feet of these people but to deny their hand in it here is just ignorant of reality.</div>
