    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I believe &quot;CIA glow in the dark niggers&quot; means &quot;people who worship darkness&quot;.</p>
<p>They are common in governance because of useless monolithic power worship (though in my view, these humans are just asleep, which also sometimes accurately describes evil acts; they almost always happen out of some form of ignorance that isn't initially understood - tragically, only <strong>after</strong> the act happens is comprehension gained [the being turns back to the light], or worse...the ignorance is doubled-down and evil rises, though it is still locked to Earth forever and simply eats itself, infinitely...).</p>
<p>I doubt Terry would've had any real troubles with good black people.  Our preconceived notions planted in our minds are often strong limitations.  To me, this man was a genius and clearly doing God's work - just very different work than we are used to accepting...</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It is very likely that TempleOS will be the ONLY usable OS &quot;someday&quot; on this forbidden rock (perhaps when time divides into itself, a day that grows nearer, as the dark winds howl ahead and some of us can feel it coming).  By my observation, Terry/David/Solomon <strong>really</strong> was a genius, and those who make fun of him may even literally be damned by their own ignorance on these matters - though I hope not.  Sadly, only God knows who those people will be - my heart goes out to those folks, as I too have been mired in my ignorance for many years.  No longer.</p>
<p>It's perfectly okay to laugh at first, so long as you keep wondering where those laughs are coming from...and you keep changing towards good.  If you instead run away, in only animistic fear, towards the darkness, you are very likely to be surprised by <strong>just how dark</strong> this world will become.  
</p>
<p>Warnings only work when we are sensitive enough to understand what is being said.  We all make fun of that which we don't understand, and sometimes, only (endless) repetition is the mother of learning.  There is not a single human that has ever existed who is perfect.  Not one.  Any interpretation of reality that is different is a carefully procured lie to trap us.  
</p>
<p>So laugh, if you must, at his most obvious mistakes - but be sure to also laugh at your own, if that is possible, as well.  On some level, we are all just like Terry.  He is either in Heaven or in his next life, to set him up to get there (to me, he has very obviously done holy work to set up the future to help us off this rock, but such a thought is not understood by the majority yet) - only God knows.</p>
<p>You may make fun of me, too, if you so desire.  But I refuse to do that to you.  There is much more to be discovered than any of us can do alone, and some of you might yet understand what I say before it's too late.</p></div>
