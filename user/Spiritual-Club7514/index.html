    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">As much as I love arguing with Democrats, you are correct about that. Since I am a lifelong devout libertarian it really doesn’t hurt me to say that conservatives have a tendency to behave in a reactionary manner these days. They mean it in a “how does it feel vibe” but it comes off more like a “I’m a jerk” vibe. However, in examples, you and every other leftist has only really been able to point to that one Reddit whereas I can point dozens of examples offhand that practice this on the left side.
The problem is that left takes any criticism of their constant virtue signaling as offensive and mean, but they have no problem, turning around and engaging in the exact behaviors that they complain about us doing 50 years ago, and to tell you the truth comes off to nearly everybody is complete and absolute hypocrisy</div>

And if you watch the original Star Trek, the womanizing barfighting Captain Kirk is not what I would call a liberal minded guy. I believe the Pelosis of the world call it “toxic masculinity”.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Leftists have ALWAYS relied on a communist like mode of censorship and accusing dissenting voices of harassment, hostility, or racism and to respond by removing people’s right to talk at all. It’s interesting coming from a constituency that references free speech and right to protest so often. Shame they only apply these rights to themselves.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Star Trek was conservative: it was rooted in the unchanging nature of man, be they hooting hominids on the plains of Earth throwing rocks at prey, or civilized spacefarers. Money, power, lust, war: These were the constants, and Star Trek knew they’d be here forever, unlike leftists. At best we could find enlightened, savvy ways to avoid the pointless fights. But some people only understand a photon torpedo up the dorsal vent port, and we’d best be prepared to deal with them. The Federation, after all, had something called General Order 24, which called for the total destruction of a planet’s surface if the civilization was considered a threat to the Federation.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That is some kind of a joke. I’ve watched Star Trek since I was Three. And while episodes occasionally touched on political issues, it did so in a way that was tasteful and occasional. NOTHING like the constant barrage of left wing pandering that you see on discovery. You will never see so much time in an episode taken up with psychological drivel and snowflake level emotional nonsense. It’s like it was written more as a political statement and less for entertaining science fiction. You must work for a school or college, that kind of snooty leftist behavior is typical for one.</div>
