    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">A lot of the shit from California is just pure virtue signaling imo. I mean sure most people in Cali are decidedly left, BUT they don't really act like it.. if that makes sense? 

I lived in South Cali probably about 2 hrs from LA for 22 years. Lots of white supremacy, the poc I had met were more stereotypically bad than the ones here (gangbanging, selling drugs, stealing cars, type shit (actually a little off topic, literally had a buddy that stole a truck and ran from police and fired at them, got himself killed obviously and I just feel bad cuz he wasn't smart enough to see through the hood culture he was raised in, deep down he was a good kid, definitely deserved better)). 

Obviously stuff like that just reinforced stereotypes of both PoC being bad and white people being racist, which wasn't good. It honestly felt like everything in California was almost comically extremist but it was reality in California. And as I was growing up especially, (I'm 25) a lot of my peers hated or resented most people older than them MAINLY for political reasons which just never made sense to me. 

Here in the south everyone is so much more laid back and I love it. Peoples perceptions of each other are more healthy and nuanced, they can get along with each other regardless of who they're voting for, it's nice. 

Basically long story short, with how extreme everything is in California and with the sheer population of California, it's not necessarily surprising that a lot of liberals tend to see California as some kind of bastion of goodness while othering everyone else. 

Sorry for rambling.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">An even crazier addendum to your earlier point about them generalizing the south so much and hating them, is that that's where the majority of African Americans are. The people they claim to be helping.. 

I grew up in California and moved to Tennessee recently, I'd never met so many black people in my entire life! And not only that, but ALL of them are so much more polite and respectful than the few that I had met in Cali. It's insane the difference.

Funnily enough, I'd also met more racists in California than I have here. I see more interracial couples and friend groups here too. Idk man crazy. All the shit I heard about the south was dead wrong lol.</div>
