&amp;#x200B;

What did the complainers expect? That's obviously a problem. If customers show up and the face of the company isn't there, how are they going to react?

Sorry you ran into that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Suddenly, the mods intervened and said that I was breaking a rule against posting work-related content.

&amp;#x200B;

I just checked, and noticed the absence of any such rule. But I'm guessing that there was one right after the intervention? I saw an admin play that game on another site - take action, and then edit the rules after the fact.

I guess the mods there must live for drama. Good to know.</div>

That's a bad faith response. Again, this is what I wrote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not being a psychiatrist, I'm not sure whether your husband sounds more like a narcissist or a sociopath, but either way, I'm worried for you and your boys.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that I just said that I'm NOT qualified to make that call. That's not a "diagnosis," that's a refusal to make one.

I'm going to block you, now.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Because somebody will probably try to claim that I quoted something out of context, I'll now include the full exchange I had with the mods, as I appealed the removal. I expressed my incredulity ...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Me:** What possible reason could you have for removing this?  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103y282/comment/j3a534p/?utm\_source=reddit&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103y282/comment/j3a534p/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  
&gt;  
&gt;In no way was my comment offensive or in violation of the rules. You would seem to have deleted it as a power flex.  
&gt;  
&gt;Until I get a satisfactory response, I'm boycotting your subreddit. This was outrageous.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

... and the conveniently anonymous mod replied.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;\[–\]subreddit message via /r/AmItheAsshole\[M\] sent 6 days ago  
&gt;  
&gt;Your question is answered in our Rules and FAQ. Please read these two links carefully and in their entirety.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our Rules | The civility sections of our FAQ  
&gt;  
&gt;Rule 1 is written so the intent is clear from the first sentence. "Attack ideas, not people." Your comment was reported and removed because it is an attack under our rules. If you think we made a genuine error removing your comment, reply to this message with your explanation so we can take another look.  
&gt;  
&gt;We do not investigate replies which are clearly addressed in the rules and FAQ:  
&gt;  
&gt;"But I didn't attack OP!" Rule 1, as it says, applies to everyone. Including the person you attacked.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But I censored it!" Censoring the word doesn't change the meaning and you still attacked a person  
&gt;  
&gt;"But I was just telling the truth! They really are a \[insert insult of choice here\]" That's your opinion, not the truth, and it's still attacking a person.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But I see worse!" Please report comments you feel are rule violations. Other rule violations do not excuse your own.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But they started it!" Regardless, you still participated in a petty spat instead of disengaging and reporting. Someone else's bad behavior does not absolve your own.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But you could have just asked me to edit it!" The removal notice is letting you know the comment broke the rules. If you want to resubmit a revised non-rule breaking version, go for it.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But what else am I supposed to call them?!" Asshole. Or nothing. Saying nothing is an option if you can't comment within the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, let's note that the husband of the OP was not one of the participants in the discussion. In no sense could I have been said to have participated in a "spat" with him. I simply commented on the wrongness of the behavior reported to me, taking the OP at her word. We don't know what her name, her husband's name, or the names of either of their sons are. We're simply replying to her description of the events. The husband could, if he had wished, shown up in the discussion using his own account, and aside from maybe the OP, none of us would have ever known. Nothing I said was going to affect his reputation, either online or offline, so in what way was I attacking him?

Also, how is the word "asshole" not an insult? The rules, as given in that reply, are self-contradictory.

The theory of the mod's defense, however, was still easy to see in that reply: since the husband might not have felt good about himself after reading what I had to say, that made it into an attack. His / her definition of "attack" was that broad, except when the word "asshole" was being used, because reasons. Completely exasperated, I told the mod exactly what I thought of this bizarre abuse of power, writing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That is the dumbest, most snowflake-ish crap I've ever heard.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm done with your sub. To answer the question in the title, yes, you're the asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and got back a simple, arrogantly dismissive

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;k

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

leaving me with the thought that sometimes, moderation is little more than a form of trolling. This is one of the reasons why I decided that I definitely wanted to have nothing more to do with that subreddit, and probably not much more to do with Reddit, in general, or even with the social web. After I'm left with my blood boiling from the sheer stupid arrogance that I've just run into, I'm also left with a question.

What, as a user, am I supposed to be getting out of this experience that is worth the aggravation?</div>

just in case the mods decide to set that to private, later on. By no means am I suggesting that anybody should go over and bother these people. I would most seriously ask that people refrain from such behavior, which would only give political ammunition to this crowd, and lead others to forget who the genuine assholes in this case, really are.

But let's remember who these people are, so when in the future we see them again, and they claim to be these poor, misunderstood makers of peace, everybody will know what they are really all about. The mere fact of their presence on that team says it all.

As for myself, I'm just going to block them all and be done with them, and then think about whether or not this site is worth my time. From what I've been hearing, this kind of thing goes on a lot on Reddit.</div>
