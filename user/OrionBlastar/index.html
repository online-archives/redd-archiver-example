    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>In writing a lot of simple apps, you don't even have to know the whole language. Just enough to access data in a database and show reports and forums with buttons that can be pressed to activate stuff. For example you can write a program in procedural statements instead of object oriented designs. </p>
<p>I'd say easiest language to learn would be BASIC, Microsoft changed how Visual BASIC works so it is more like Java now since 2002 and Visual BASIC 6.0 was the last Classic Visual BASIC. </p></div>

<p>They auto-reject people based on resumes using AI programs to read in Word documents and index them. Those who meet the strict requirements and keywords get the interviews and are asked to build a sample app in one hour that does something like messaging in Java using frameworks and OOP and best practices. When they fail to hire someone they go for H1B Visa quotas.</p>
<p>You find some stuff like 5+ years of Visual C# 2015 as a requirement, it is insane.</p></div>

<p>They sort of gave up in the 1980s when the personal computer came out and it was targeted to boys. Women in computer science has declined since then.</p>
<p>Boys and men filled the void left by women who left programming jobs. </p>
<p>So really these gender politics issues are silly, women used to dominate programming at one time. The only reason why we don't have more women as programmers is lack of interest. Only 18% of computer science students are female. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>That worldview is not based on logic or reason, it is based on hatred of the white straight male. Hate never passes intellectual scrutiny. </p>
<p>The only reason why there are so many white straight males in computer science and information systems is that is the only group that studied them to get a degree in them to be qualified for the job. There is nothing to stop a female or non-white person to take those courses but few do.</p>
<p>Let me explain it with a 9Gag cartoon:
<a href="http://9gag.com/gag/a6ye7xR/gender-pay-gap-in-stem-fields-explained">http://9gag.com/gag/a6ye7xR/gender-pay-gap-in-stem-fields-explained</a></p>
<p>You got STEM and Gender Studies, women refuse to sign up for STEM and choose Gender Studies instead and then protest that STEM is mostly white straight males. If they chose STEM instead they'd have the same jobs as their male counterparts. </p></div>

That only the white straight male can be racist or sexist. White straight males are evil, the devil. When IT jobs start going to people with degrees in gender studies or women's studies you know the company is going into SJW mode because instead of hiring for information systems or computer science degrees they hire for humanities and art degrees and just let them attack the white straight males and drive them out of the company.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>This all started in the Opal project, when they wanted to remove a programmer for making homophobic tweets. What I read about his tweets was stuff like X+Y = Male and X+X = Female on a T-shirt image. It seems like biology stuff. But since Transgender people were offended by it, it became transphobic. There was a thread to remove him, and they refused, so there was another thread to make a CoC or code of conduct for Github projects. It was written by SJWs, and only white males can be sexist or racist according to their definitions. All other forms of racism or sexism towards white males will be allowed and they will not act upon it.</p>
<p>I think this sort of stuff is like another Gamergate scandal. The news media will most likely vilify the white males in this case like they did in Gamergate. It seems to be good for their ratings to bias the news on the SJWs worldview.</p></div>
