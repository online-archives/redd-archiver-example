    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Anyway, my point was that the website is not a beacon of free speech at all. In fact, the mods are happy to ban people for not agreeing with their political beliefs. No matter how you want to spin that, it's not free speech. Imagine if Google or YouTube banned someone because they were "being a shill" – who gets to decide what constitutes as a "shill"? The fact that non-supporters aren't even allowed is conclusive evidence that it's anti-free speech, not pro. 

Don't let partisan bias cloud your judgement. Call a spade a spade. The truth is that that place's mods are all for censorship. The fact that their politics align with yours should not influence this fact in any way.</div>

Title of the post: "IsItBullshit: George Floyd resisted arrest"

Content of the post: 

According to the [Minneapolis police report](https://www.startribune.com/mpls-police-still-haven-t-explained-misinformation-after-floyd-s-death/570970152/), George Floyd had "physically resisted" as he was being arrested. However, [according to one witness](https://fox6now.com/2020/06/05/witness-george-floyd-didnt-resist-arrest-tried-to-defuse-things/), George Floyd "didn't resist" and even tried to "defuse" the situation.   

I then looked to other sources to find out more.

When I went looking to see whether or not this was true (that George Floyd resisted arrest), I found several news articles reporting that George Floyd did not resist arrest. The following are a few that I found:

[Surveillance video does not support police claims that George Floyd resisted arrest
](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/video-george-floyd-contradict-resist-trnd/index.html)

[Video doesn’t appear to show George Floyd resisting arrest as cops claimed
](https://nypost.com/2020/05/27/video-does-not-appear-to-show-george-floyd-resisting-arrest/)

[George Floyd’s friend, witness to his death speaks out: He did not resist arrest
](https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-floyds-friend-witness-death-speaks-resist-arrest/story?id=71084042)

From the news articles I found, the evidence seems conclusive. From these reports, it can be concluded that George Floyd had not, in fact, resisted arrest. 

**Following up with these articles, I looked to the surveillance video to see what it showed.** 

I found a New York Times video that shows, with timestamps, how George Floyd was arrested: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vksEJR9EPQ8

In this video, it does not appear that he was resisting, as well as in the following pieces of footage I also watched: 

Also, in NBC's "Minute-to-Minute breakdown," it also shows a lack of resisting arrest from George Floyd: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiSm0Nuqomg

Finally, this Washington Post, another minute-by-minute breakdown video, seems to also show George Floyd not resisting arrest:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMGUAHBFmjk

**However, it was until I came across this following piece of footage of George Floyd being arrested that I thought it impossible that he resisted arrest:**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4ABfJCw9Ls&amp;feature=youtu.be

In this video clip – interestingly titled "George Floyd missing footage" – it does appear to show George Floyd, in some sense, refusing to cooperate with officers. In the video, George Floyd does appear to resist arrest. 

**Does this mean that George Floyd "physically resisted" arrest as the police department claimed, or does it not?** 

**Does what was in the video qualify as "resisting arrest"?**</div>
