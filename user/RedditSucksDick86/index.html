I'd build a site that functions like Reddit but actually allows dissenting opinions and operates from a first amendment perspective.

The only problem with that, is that you get actual Nazis that get on there and just spam some gay, 17 hour "documentary" and brigade everyone all the time so that you can't have a discussion about anything at all unless you mute or block them, which is honestly not too much to ask, because thats how we handled them back in the 90s on message boards.</div>

Nobody wants Nazis here and it's stupid for these retreads to assume that just because "DURRR it's the South!" That it's still some Jim Crow shitkicker paradise down here, because it's not and the only way someone would believe that, is if they're a skinny, lisping little bitch who has never lived outside of an urban shithole and pays $15 for toast with avocado spread on it in the morning because he's too spoiled to prepare his own meals.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>It means you sound like someone who might murder people because you’re a nutbar who compares Reddit karma to Nazi Germany and Mao’s Red Guard and that’s the kind of thing school shooters do.

This right here is proof that you can't read, because I never compared karma itself to those things, I made a completely unrelated statement that both of those groups were killed off when they outlived their usefulness to the regime.

But I absolutely did say that the karma system is designed to reward groupthink/propagation of establishment narratives and punish dissidents and factual information that is inconvenient.

I'm assuming that you like being able to hide comments that you disagree with, because your avatar is wearing a 🌈 jacket.</div>

I don't *want* to be around them, I don't want them interfering with my lifestyle, activities, or plans.

If it was at all feasible, I'd buy about 200 acres of property somewhere and fuck off to be left alone--

But here's the thing:

Those types of people will **never** leave you alone, because they are crypto-fascists who believe that they "know what's best for people" and in reality, everything that they've ever done "for the greater good" has been a net fucking negative for mankind as a whole. I do **not** want to be swept up in their bullshit and I'm willing to fortify an area to make sure that I can be left unmolested by the "It Takes A Village" crowd.</div>

What isn't great, is hiding their contribution to a discussion because you don't agree with it. It's more of that fruitcake "nO pLaTfOrMiNg" crap that's going to end in the people who "nO pLaTfOrM" others in real life, getting one in the head eventually, because they'll have outlived their usefulness.


My hope is that we don't make it to that point. I really don't want anyone to be killed for having an opinion, because I'm not an ideologue True Believer™</div>

Four years ago, this is the part where I'd link you to Bellingcat but now I know that they're just an outfit of one of the agencies and that they can't be taken seriously anymore now that I know this.

People think that there's some massive White nationalist problem in America because of California and prison gangs.   The current administration has seriously talked up the supposed danger that White nationalists/separatists/supremacists play, because they want to do something fucked up and use that as the excuse in the exact same way that the Bush administration was using "Islamic terrorism" as an excuse to do all of its awful shit in the aftermath of 9/11/01.

It's that exact reason, because I've *seen* this shit play out once before already, that I call bullshit on the Biden admins narrative... Unless Obama actually did fuck this country up so badly that he managed to turn a massive number of people who voted for him twice, into "Nazis"</div>

Not liking something isn't the same as having an irrational fear of it, but the term "Islamophobia" was invented by CAIR shortly after 9/11/01 to try and conflate disagreement with the ideology of Islam with "homophobia".

It's the same concept as the pieces of vile dog shit that use the term "climate change denier". They're trying to lump people who aren't on board with the ideology in with Holocaust deniers, which is extremely gross (and also hypocritical, as these people will usually hand wave other 20th century crimes against mankind).</div>

None of these guys in the picture are fat and they're wearing masks. 

Normally, the big scary Nazis that lurk around the corner in every shitlib's imagination have absolutely no problem with people knowing who they are, because they are usually preppers/bunker-builders and really couldn't care less about approval from society.

The narrative that USA is full of "nAzIs" and that they are well organized and around every corner is simply bullshit that's being spewed by Oba-- I mean "The Biden Administration ™" to justify surveillance and persecution of their political opponents.

Remember that Obama part deux has been slurring repeatedly about "White Supremacy" being "the most significant terror threat". This is all part of a narrative that's being set up to justify massive overreaches and unconstitutional actions within the next few months.

Ukraine has far more serious business, dedicated "NaZiS" than the US does and they have no problem sending them billions of dollars in weapons that only 30% of which make it to the front lines.

Of course, Reddit is mostly full-anal, race-marxist college students and teens, and they are almost always the dumbest people in the room that would actually believe that this was anything other than a psyop to add a little "See I told you so!" To the absolute batshit lies that the Biden administration has been selling the public for 4 years now.</div>

Reddit of course, being a thinly veiled shitlib propaganda dissemination system, "suggests" these threads and communities to you and I, because it's main purpose is to manufacture consensus.

I mean shit, the very system of upvotes and downvotes is designed to reward politically correct groupthink and punish dissidents.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This happens with a lot of posts wherein the subject matter or opinion stated isn't politically correct or at least consensus among blue haired anal types.

This happens because Reddit is now owned by Advance media/Tencent, and they are colluding with the US govt and European govts to propagate narratives that are favorable to the globaloid establishment.</div>
