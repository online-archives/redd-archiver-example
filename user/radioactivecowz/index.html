    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I mean there is a huge difference between the education levels of the working class and the countries leading scientists, who are often foreign-educated. Universities throughout Europe, Australia, and the US are typically filled with wealthy Chinese nationals. This video even says that this is the team that identified the bat colony that SARS came from. I'd imagine they have some understanding and experience in handling and quarantining bats safely. I'm no supporter of China but its really not fair to compare the leading epidemiologists and biologists to any random bozo that happens to run a factory or a steel mill.</div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">There are plenty of other explanations of why China could be hiding this person. For example, they may have been vocal about the disease against censorship rulings, or critical of the government's response.

It's also worth noting that it seems unlikely that the virus was transmitted directly from bats to humans. This is the third major coronavirus outbreak, following SARS and MERS. SARS was spread from horseshoe bats to civets, then from civets to humans. MERS spread from Egyptian tomb bats to camels, then from camels to humans. Especially considering the occurrence of the disease in trafficked animals like pangolins, it seems highly likely that the disease came through another animal more closely related to humans.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No doubt that the coronavirus originated from wild animals and spread to humans in Wuhan, but I'd be pretty shocked if it had come out of a lab studying the virus. Even in China, these top epidemiologists would understand the importance of quarantine and preventing animal to human transmission. For the virus to have originated from a wet market, with live animals slaughtered, prepared, and eaten in the same area, seems much more plausible. Those markets are a hotbed of disease, including SARS, and are operated by people who could not care less about emergent zoonotic diseases.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">But biologists don't use the term gender in a scientific context. You wouldn't talk about a frog or a birds gender, you'd say sex. A biologist would never talk about the gender of a flower or gametophyte, we talk about their sex. Likewise with humans, we talk about sex in a biological context rather than gender. Saying that binary gender is a biological fact is quite simply inaccurate, and not a claim a reputable biologist would make.</div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../r/RedditCensors/comments/97si8c/its_the_censorship_olympics_over_at_routoftheloop/#comment-e4askcl">It&#39;s the censorship Olympics over at /r/OutOfTheLoop as the mods have to deal with some uncomfortable but rule-abiding explanations of Dinesh D&#39;Souza&#39;s &#34;Death of a Nation&#34; movie. Next event: 4D Chess as they attempt to explain away their rationale for removing perfectly good replies.</a>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I certainly don't agree that all those comments deserved to be deleted, but after reading through a lot of them it is clear that many violated the rule three in a pretty basic way. Many weren't answering (or even addressing) the question, which is grounds for removal, as all top-level comments must be an attempt to answer to question. Any comments telling OP to watch the film or just talking about censorship definitely break this rule and should have been deleted. Its only a handful of comments that really don't seem to break any rules that were deleted</div>
