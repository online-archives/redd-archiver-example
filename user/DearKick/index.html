    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">To add context, and not in an argumentative way as the hypothesis has the possibility to be correct:

The linked hearing was extremely political and holds about as much scientific fact as any other US congress hearing. The Rep who held the hearing is in fact a physician, a Podiatrist to be exact, but is still a politician. The main witness, a virologist placed in charge of the CDC by President Trump is an expert in the field.

He stated (and reaffirmed in later statements): that his belief that a lab leak was possible centered around 2 main points. 1. The virus spread unusually fast for a human disease 2. The virus was discovered in Wuhan; a city that has a lab that researches coronaviruses for China. 

The opponents to the theory state in response that 1. Rapid spread could be of natural origin and 2. Most large cities in China are home to Labs that happen to study Coronaviruses (I thought this was a very interesting but strange fact). Therefore if an outbreak is discovered in any major city in China it is highly likely it is near a lab anyways. 

As stated explicitly in the hearing linked by the OP all of their conclusions are based on “circumstantial evidence”. This doesn’t take away from the fact that this is an official US government hearing so it is probably acceptable to show it to people in support of your argument, just be aware it is not based on any direct links or facts but rather circumstances and circumstantial evidence. The witnesses make no attempt to pass off their opinions as anything more and aren’t doing any deceptive but rather drawing conclusions based on the information they have available.

Personally I think we as the American public will never see any direct link or affirmative answer. This is due to 2 reasons: 1: China is extremely secretive and would never on wholesale admit to it 2: the United States is extremely secretive and most likely wouldn’t go public either if they have found such links. 

TLDR; 
Within the “intelligence community” of the United States including the FBI, CIA, DNI etc. 2 agencies have said a lab leak is possible with “low confidence” and 5 have said either unlikely or unsure without a confidence rate. The WHO says it is unlikely, and China has said (surprise surprise) “no way josé”.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Those coming to OPs side and trying to support them, please stop- they are trolling indeed.

As pointed out by another redditer, their profile is filled with many statements that likely prove this.

Within the past 14 days they have commented about “woke people canceling everything”, Illegals pouring into the country, and how Tucker Carlson is someone to listen to and he’s hated for no reason, multiple pro-trump comments

And my personal favorite comment:

*typical liberal treason upvoted on here*

To OP, please use a throwaway account next time.</div>
