    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> My question was why did they omit that info from the documentary?

I told you why.  Because it’s not what the uprising was about.  

> I did. 

You didn’t.

> I think it’s a load of neocon/neolib bullshit

This is just wildly ignorant of the conditions that make your quality of life possible.  You can call it bullshit all you want, but America’s economic success is underpinned by a free world order (relative stability, free trade, a prosperous world).  That free world order was made possible by the US’s military might.  

> “security” and “economic interests”

Putting those things in quotes doesn’t diminish their importance.  And it doesn’t refute anything I said.  

> economic and social decay

This is hilarious.  Our economy is the strongest it had ever been.  I think you’ve just watched too much Fox news.  

> We can fund billions for a conflict that most Americans aren’t impacted by in anyway

But they are.  And I explained how.  Which you just said “nuh-uh” to. You just lives in ignorance of how the world around you works and what makes it tun.  We live in a globally connected economy and world, what happens outside out borders has a strong impact on what happens inside our borders.  You haven’t logically explained how that isn’t the case, you just called it bullshit.  You seem to be happy living in ignorance, but I’m still going to suggest you watch [this](https://youtu.be/eUL8EvZkfEY?si=rvDKpWpIBmaUQ__Z) video on youtube by Perun.  It explains how military alliances fit into long-term US strategy and how the Ukraine war affects that.

> souther border

There was a bill that address the southern border that was bipartisan and that was endorsed by border agencies.  Republicans killed it because Trump wanted the border to remain an issue for the election and they went along with it.  

 > Ukraine isn’t a NATO member

NATO members are next.  It is blatantly obvious by Russia’s actions and demands.  So if you care about NATO, isn’t better to spend money to defeat Russia now instead of having to send our troops to die in a war against Russia later?  This is a direct threat and challenge to NATO.  Furthermore *we do* have an obligation to help Ukraine.  We gave security assurances to Ukraine in the Budapest memorandum in return for  it giving up its nukes.  Turning away from that only weakens our credibility and encourages other countries to develop their own nukes, unless you want to tell me lowering the risk of a global nuclear war isn’t in our interest either?  

> Ukraine is an insanely corrupt country

Ukraine is much less corrupt than it used to be.  [Read this](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/wartime-ukraine-ranks-among-worlds-top-performers-in-anti-corruption-index/).  Ukraine continues to improve in anti-corruption and is now ahead of Turkey, a NATO member, in corruption.  Again, this is Russian propaganda you are pushing.  Ukraine still has an issue with corruption that it absolutely needs to continue addressing, but the over-stated severity of it is Russian propaganda.  

> Fuck off with your “security” and “economic interests”

Yea this isn’t much of a response to anything.  It just reeks of ignorance of what makes your quality of life possible.  Having strong allies is in our interest.  Growing our alliances, both military and economic, is in our interest.  Is it not in our long term interest to have as many free and stable democracies in the world as possible?  Is it not in our interest to weaken countries who actively undermine us and those around them like Russia?  Is it not in our interest to have as much access to global trade and markets that is unimpeded by countries like Russia?  Is it not in our interest for those markets to be prosperous?  Do you really think a free and stable world is not in our interest?  You really need to educate yourself.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> So why did the director of Winter On Fire omit their involvement

Because it was not a neo-nazi uprising.  Their involvement is not a “key fact” because Euromaidan was not in pursuit of neo-nazi goals, nor did it result in a neo-nazi or fascist government.  It resulted in a more free and democratic country, and that’s what the vast majority of the people who were at Euromaidan were fighting for.  The fact that neo-nazis participated in it and supported it for their own reasons doesn’t change that.  

> Half the country was split on Maidan

The majority of Ukrainians supported it and want to be part of the West.  Even more so now than before.  They are literally fighting an all-out war in pursuit of that.  

> these are facts you’re attempting to hand-wave away

The only one attempting to hand-wave away anything here is you.  You haven’t even responded to most of my original reply, you know about how this is important to our national security and economic interest.  You’ve latched onto the fact that neo-nazis participated in Euromaidan to somehow argue that it was not about joining the West or about freedom, even though that’s what it resulted in.  You’re attempting to grossly inflate the importance of that fact, which is the Russian propaganda part.  Oh, and the implication that the West somehow controlled Euromaidan is also the Russian propaganda part.  It is truly jarring how many people in the US believe in Russian propaganda.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> That we financed and helped

Financed and helped how exactly?  With political support?  That doesn’t change anything.  

The fact that there are neo-Nazis in Ukraine and those neo-nazis participated in euro maidan does not mean it was not a popular uprising in pursuit of a free country that is part of the West.  Calling the documentary propaganda is just utterly ridiculous.  I fail to see how conversations between to us state actors prove much of anything.  

> An entirely one sided view of Maidan

What is the other side?  The side of the Berkut who beat student protestors?  The side of the corrupt Russian puppet government?  The side of Russia, who is responsible for the corruption in the first place?  What other side is there?  

You also conveniently ignored all my other points.  You want to call documentaries propaganda yet are repeating actual Russian propaganda.  I thought perhaps you might be a reasonable person that has legitimate concerns and can be reasoned with.  I was wrong.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">> We did the exact same thing that you accuse the Russians if wanting to do

This is utterly ludicrous.  The euro maidan was a popular protest movement by regular Ukrainians who were tired of their Russian puppet government and who wanted to be part of Europe and not the Soviet bloc.  The US did not fund jack shit.  But again, the notion that supporting a popular uprising against a corrupt and autocratic regime is the same thing as invading a sovereign nation to install a puppet government and destroy its national identity is ridiculous.  The notion that Euro maidan was a Western plot and not a popular uprising is straight Russian propaganda.  It is incredibly disrespectful to the Ukrainians who took part in that, and to the god knows how many Ukrainians who have died defending their nation from Russia *because they don’t want to be controlled by Russia*.  I strongly suggest you watch the documentary titled “Winter on Fire” on netflix.  It is about Euromaidan and is told from the perspective of people who were there and is mostly actual footage of the uprising.  

> There’s a broader geopolitical context

Yea and that broader geopolitical context is that Russia wants to control Ukraine for its own benefit because it wants to re-establish the Russian empire.  The broader geopolitical context is this is the start of an attack on the liberal world order that the US established after world war 2 and that has underpinned our economic success and prosperity since then.  

> to a corrupt shithole in Eastern Europe

Ukraine has made great strides in corruption.  But it was so corrupt to begin with because of Russia.  This is how Russia operates and undermines its neighbors.  

> has never been in the Western sphere of influence historically speaking

Plenty of countries weren’t before but now are.  It is squarely within our national interest to bring more countries into the West.

> while our own country is falling apart at home

Withdrawing from the world is not going to fix our issues, it will only make them 10x worse.

> Pardon me for valuing what happens in my own country over a country on the other side of the globe that contributes nothing to the west.

The point is that what happens in Ukraine affects what happens in our own country.  Ukraine is absolutely contributing to the West right now.  Russia is the one of the largest threats to the Western world order, and Ukraine is decimating their military capabilities which would take years to rebuild if the war ended right now.  Ukraine is a nation that *wants* to be a democracy and part of the West.  They had a literal revolution over it in 2014 and are now valiantly fighting a war against Russia over it.  Ukraine has the potential to be a strong ally in Europe, it is in our national security and economic interest that as many nations in the world as possible are free and prosperous nations that we are allied with.  It is harmful to our long term national security interests to let Russia grow in power by invading and annexing its neighbors.  Which by the way, will not stop in Ukraine.  The Baltics are next.  And then the US will be faced with going to war with Russia or abandoning the world order our success over the past 80 years has been built on.  I strongly suggest you watch [this](https://youtu.be/eUL8EvZkfEY?si=rFTF1CluVBclemqg) youtube video by Perun on how military alliances fit into US long term strategy.  

Ensuring Ukraine retains its sovereignty and that Russia is defeated is in our national security and economic interest because maintaining and expanding the free world order is in our national security and economic interest.  This is an attack on that order which will not stop at Ukraine.  Besides all that, we also have a strong moral obligation to help Ukraine.  Ukraine is not Afghanistan.  Ukraine wants to be part of the free world.  Its people fought a revolution in 2014 to move away from Russia and to the free world.  And now Ukrainians are dying by the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands to not come under Russia’s boot.  When we fought our own revolution we got a lot of help from other nations, it would be morally derelict to now turn our backs on a people in a similar situation.  Not to mention the fact that Ukraine gave up its nukes for US security assurances.  If we turn our backs in Ukraine then that will hurt our credibility.</div>

Especially calling it an “anti-war” opinion.  Ukraine did not start this war.  Russia is the one waging an aggressive and unprovoked war in an attempt to annex parts of Ukrainian land and destroy its sovereignty by installing a puppet regime.  Being “anti-war” in this situation is just advocating for giving up in the face of aggression.  This is not just some random spat that we are funding.  Furthermore, if Russia wins in Ukraine than a much larger and destructive war is likely to follow.  Ensuring Russia is defeated is preventing that.</div>
