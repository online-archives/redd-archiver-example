Per the article, everyone actually involved was ready for a peace deal with comical terms and then the prime minister of the uk said, as quoted in the article, “let’s not sign anything with them at all and let’s just go to war” so Ukraine said yes master and fought. Do you really believe this shit?

Please do find the many other sources that aren’t transparent garbage.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You should listen to what the person who invaded actually says, because most of the time it’s straightforward language about Ukraine being a fake vassal country whose people belong to Russia, with the occasional “oh btw it’s really about nato” which apparently suffices to convince people like you. Not to mention, Ukraine wasn’t particularly close to joining nato (and in fact couldn’t based on crimea’s situation post 2014).

Also, answer my question, in your hypothetical, by stop it, you mean destroy Mexico and take its people? Because, obviously and unequivocally no lmao. Even in your own wishfully made up hypothetical, Russia is wrong.</div>

But the answer is 2014 was murkier, some little green men taking over russian speaking enclaves vs. The Russian army invading with the explicit goal of taking the entire country. I agree though, we should have lifted a finger in 2014!</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It’s more straightforward than that. This goes for your other comment as well:

Russia is led by a dictator who is intent on subjugating Ukrainians ( who he does not believe are a real people). They don’t want that, and are willing to fight him over it. I think that’s worth 6 percent of our *military budget* to support.

The question is more: why does this bother you so much? It’s definitely not proportionate to the amount of money we spend on it</div>
