Or if you prefer, you can find what you're looking for in the initial comment I made

>Ugh, get fucked

We give words meaning, and in many cases, there are potentially multiple reasonable or justifiable ways to define terms and labels. That said, I won't insult your intelligence by pretending you actually believe this is nothing more than a semantic, etymological issue. I think I've given this significantly more thought and respect than it deserves just by virtue of being honest. While the other user was childish and actively disrespectful, both of you have misrepresented and diminished the reality of the experiences, challenges, and attitudes surrounding trans issues.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Why would I respect them, and what more thought is required? It isn't difficult to assess the validity of a bigoted statement, especially when they are outright dismissing medical and psychological facts because of their own issues with human sexuality and gender, and a desire to needlessly conform with rigid, simplistic social constructsm. 

What would you consider to be an appropriate and sufficiently respectful response to their content? Correct me if I'm wrong, but considering the way you are jumping to their defense, I presume you are inclined to either agree with them, or view their view as an equally valid perspective, in which case you're welcome to get fucked as well. If I'm mistaken, then this was way overboard and I'm fully prepared to apologize. 

I just don't know what you expect I should have done - politely explain to him why what he's saying is hateful, dismissive, deceitful bullshit, as if this could possibly be a simple misunderstanding? Incidentally, what about his comment gave you the impression that he was being even the slightest bit thoughtful or respectful, and therefore deserving of the same in return? I believe I adequately reciprocated the tone and intent towards one asshole that he levied at an entire group of people who just want the right to exist as who they are. 

Thought out and respectful enough for you?</div>
