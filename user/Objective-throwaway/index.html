As for when it’s come back to bite us. I mean the entire point of USA foreign policy in the 2010s was the appeasement of Putin in order to keep him from doing exactly what he is currently doing.

We’re basically fucking over one of our top geopolitical rivals with no Americans killed. And for dirt fucking cheap as far as wars go. Pretty good deal all things considered</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The USA budget is over 2 trillion dollars this year. Of that 50 billion being sent to Ukraine. The vast majority is either arms we were just storing or money being put back into the United States economy. Only 50 million is just straight up cash. Assuming that the USAs budget for universal health care was similar to other countries. About 3000$ a person, universal healthcare would cost a bit over 1 trillion dollars. About 40 times the total aid being sent to Ukraine</div>
