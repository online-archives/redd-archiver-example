    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Gang banger has evolved to not mean actual gang. They're mostly all posers. Wannabe gang bangers. No militarized chain of command exists anymore. The actual gangs that care about what gang they're in and opponents are, are all in prisons. On the outside they all get along if there's a profit to be made. There's a ton of infighting and that's why you don't see actual gang warfare anymore.  
Thanks for proving you are incapable of very basic modern general truths known to basically everyone.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Their fuck up was being next to gang bangers because gang bangers gonna do gang banging shit. Now in the news, we get to hear all day every day about a dead woman and 9 hurt kids, but not the gang bangers. 

Last year there was a mass shooting in Miami. No one saw anything, but thats because it was gang bangers ambushing other gang bangers. Called a mass shooting, when it was not. And the community helped the gang bangers by not being snitches. 

Fix that. Collateral damage stops happening as much. You're furthering the narrative and making innocent law abiding citizens less safe. You're standing on the corpses of children not wanting to solve the problem and want more piles of dead children to further your agenda. You're deplorable.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well full gang style violence is higher than ever without the proliferation of said gangs. I'm from Chicago, cousin was a disciple. Murdered in 06. Even back then people were getting out of the hard-core initiations and were dealing across lines to make more $. They also tended to get killed off way more. Nowadays you can have the same "gang" getting represented but 3 streets over is the same gang, and they're all still killing each other. 

What you describe is road rage without the road. And the simple fact that will always be true, the only sure fire way, is to have good guys with guns massively outnumber the bad guys. Don't give them a chance to let politicized judges let them out with a promise to reappear, which almost every time will result with a fugitive. One that's left to terrorize the public even more. 

And going back to outlaw days. We named certain people outlaws because they existed outside the law. If you went up to one and shot them in the back, you were called a hero. Handicapping the good guys with guns as we see happening, while ignoring the bad guys with guns is why we are where we are. And no where in the media is this allowed because it's counter to the narrative. It's all ever about gun grabbing. And I'm glad that I live in a state that won't stand for it. To make an ammendment reversing the 2nd, we need a 2/3rds vote in the house and congress and that aint ever gonna happen. So civil war is threatened by politicians that want to act in a treasonous way. A civil war that the military won't fight and the side that won't just leave the good guys with guns alone, can't win. Which is why we have more illegals mostly fighting age males coming up from the border, who now outnumber the amount of population in the least 5 populated states, and out pacing our entire countries birth rate. Force them into the military and they won't see a problem killing Americans. 

Yapping on about gun crime and statistics and political slants is accomplishing nothing. The law is on our side. Wanna fix it, create an industry of armed security everywhere, separate of the cops. Like... a militia. Armed teachers in every single classroom. Amnesty for anyone that puts down criminals with firearms. That would change the culture. That would improve every measurable crime statistic.</div>

If they went anywhere else in Missouri that wouldn't have happened. So the one big blue area has an African American gun violence problem and the whole country has to just act like that's totally not a thing. Then reclassify everything else to make it a mass shooting when it's gang related, until it makes it look bad and you have to drop other stats to form a narrative.</div>

But simply knowing that and spreading the counter narrative because the news won't, makes us a bigot. If you were as center on the political compass as everyone else, you'd be like us and say fuck off, I guess we're bigots now then. Instead you're oh so worried about what being labeled an ista phobe even tho you are the 1st to do it yourself. Like a child.</div>

What op did is not homophobia. It's factual info that the news won't allow to exist in the narrative. Like the many trans mass shooters that happened in the last 30 days no one even knows about. But we must be homophobes because we are aware of them. The %80 of people in the political center are sick of that. And you.</div>

Now the biggest reason for this is because the narrative is constantly changing. The over %80 of people in the middle are sick of it. So they jump to the side that won't call them a nazi because there's one small thing they happen to not agree on. There's a reason the left can't meme and that npc meme became a thing. If so many didn't see a ringing of truth to it, it wouldn't still be a thing.</div>
