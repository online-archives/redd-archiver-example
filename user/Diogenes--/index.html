Yeah you're doing something way different with children haha

You walked right into that one, seriously.  And you're so upset, sheesh grow a skin.  This exchange really ruined your day eh?  And I'm chuckling about it.  Don't complain about how hard things are when you're weak - make yourself strong instead.

Btw that's why I misread you as a far-leftist, you're weak.</div>

Your opinion doesn't matter to me at all.  I spoke my mind, and will continue to.

&gt; So you decide to call people you don't agree with online pedos?

In the human mind, there's a sort of "see-saw" between emotion and logic.  Most humans are too strong on the emotion, and that reply tells me you're among the crowd here.  There's no discussion unless you can calm down and think properly.  Sheesh, like children, stg...  maybe that's why you're so fixated on them.  Maybe it's some Freudian thing about the childhood your own childish parent denied you.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Why's it so important for children to be exposed to any adult themed content, whether gay straight or otherwise?  They're kids, they aren't thinking about sex, gender, etc.  The vast majority will flow more or less naturally into being a reasonably well functioning adult without having sex &amp; gender stuff rammed down their throat.

So... why?  It seems very self-indulgent to me.  There are a lot of people in the world who lack any sort of meaning or purpose.  Some become revolutionaries, others make their sexuality into the cornerstone (onlystone?  haha) of their personality and have a weird fixation on kids...  Few if any ever think to look inward.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My first post there was asking them what their favorite dildo is lol.  It got no votes or replies, I logged to another account and didn't see the post.  Then in the comments section of another thread I asked if they've ever gotten their testosterone checked and that got me a proper ban.

Long story short, I think they have one of those systems where your replies, but especially threads you start, get a look-over before a mod approves them, and the threshold may depend on your overall karma (to discourage throwaway account posts) - lots of subs do this.

It must be a ton of work for them, but since [92% of far-leftists live with their parents](https://www.wnd.com/2019/06/92-of-leftist-activists-live-with-parents-1-in-3-unemployed/), I guess that gives them enough time to go full Stalin with their censorship / control of their faggy sub.

Edit: Check out r menslibwatch.  Menslib also gets highlighted a lot in r srssucks.  Those links don't work intentionally btw, no need to stir up a ~~hornet's~~ soyboys nest by linking them.</div>

What's most likely is either they muted your accounts, or their subreddit doesn't allow comments from accounts which are new or don't have a certain amount of karma - many subs do this.  Many subs also have bots which automatically ban or mute accounts for simply posting in any sub they don't like.  This is almost exclusively done by radical left subreddits, and posting anything on a center or right-of-center subreddit will get you banned or muted from these snowflake safe spaces.</div>

Peterson's correct in that one's life is up to them and the choices they make.

The left has been indoctrinated to believe that anyone who's not white + male can't be more than a fry cook and that it's white mens' fault.  So don't "clean your room", eg. study, learn and improve yourself (the things it would take to be more than a fry cook) - just be hateful and blame white men.  The torch &amp; pitchfork witch-hunt mentality is much easier than growing and building one's self.

It's clear enough to see why they're so rabid about Dr. P.  They're like Christians talking about Richard Dawkins lol.</div>

What you're missing out on is participating in threads like...

"DAE cry all the time for no reason?"

"Had enjoyable consensual sex, was I raped?"

"Drank 3 bottles of hard liquor and don't remember anything, was I roofied?"

It's not exactly a great loss.  You can even still read it for the lulz.  Just can't participate on your main account.</div>
