    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">But why should they have to be filmed ? surely the bad ones should be weeded out well before they’re ever allowed to start doing actual work. But it’s not unjust, but it’s also not all security guards it’s just that it’s happened to so many people that it is a problem. 
That’s not the only way, for one why aren’t the cops taught de-escalation techniques, or why it shouldn’t be shoot first questions later. 
And the reason it is systematic racism is that POC are usually targeted or profiled even though they’ve done nothing wrong. There’s also the fact that POC tend to get longer sentences for the same crimes as white people which is systematic racism since it is the system.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1.Okay I’ll be honest if that first solution caused what happened in mineapolis then it proposes wouldn’t work, but unfortunately if that doesn’t work then we need to think of something that will.
2.The consequences should be at a minimum paying for the destruction they caused, and yes the masks make this an incredibly difficult job. Also why is brutality in “” that is literally brutality especially the hit them part, and pepper spray is being used on inocent bystanders and children so as of right not it is not a good solution. 
3. I haven’t seen the videos no, but i wadnt defending the majority of the rioters, and the police officer that was killed is terrible, they looters who did it should be in jail, but they all probably had masks so unfortunately that’s unlikely.
4. Floyd wasn’t shot no, but what the officer did wasn’t something that they are trained to do. I was also referring to the many cases of officers shooting black men who are simply holding an item in their hand (like a toy truck or a wallet). This could be something that happens less often with more training on how to interact with people and that shooting should not be the first option. 
5. I’ve never heard of that till now but that’s absolutely awful, did they get arrested?, because of not they definitely should’ve. 
6. What do you mean by respect the police? I respect them sure but i also don’t like them due to the system they protect. 
7. Also you can lean left and support the second amendment, i am extremely left leaning and i wholeheartedly support it since it is something that citizens should be allowed to have, and most dems are not pushing for gun removal just a stricter licensing system due to the incredibly high amount of school shootings. America also has an incredibly toxic gun culture which is why some people want to fully ban them, guns are legal in other countries and they have half the number of shooting if not even less. 
8. I don’t stand to disband it just to change it. The system is very racist which is problematic, the training is subpar since it is very physical heavy, and many cops are trigger happy and will shoot without reason. 
8. do you mean the political ideology or the overall violence</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I’ll respond to this part by part. 
1. Personally I am not black so I don’t want to answer for them, however my understanding is that the initial protests were to get the man who murdered George Floyd arrested. But now that he has been arrested it has now changed to protesting for an overall change in the police force.
2. That’s true, the problem was that some officers will never get charged since there is no evidence, so far in the riots there has been video evidence that conflicts with the polices reports of what is happening, this is causing increasing tensions among the protesters since they don’t want someone else’s death to be justified when the only information was coming from one officer.
3. That is very true and very unfortunate, the looters are definitely the worst of the bunch since there is usually no justification (with the only exception being if a store is refusing to sell supplies to the protesters(and even then the only thing being looted should be said supplies)). The majority of the looters are opportunistic and should be arrested since it is theft. The riots are a much harder thing to judge since one theory is that in some places the police is using undercover agents to start the riots so they can justify using force, if that is the case then the solution would be for the police to pull out of the area briefly so the rioters can calm down. But if the riots started with no provocation then there should be consequences for those who started it and possibly for those who joined and caused significant property damage.
4.We do need police yes, just not in its present form, personally i think that police should go through a much longer training program that doesn’t solely focus on physical and other similar training. A whole squad resigning is bad yes, but unfortunately that’s all they can do to show their solidarity, and although yes there is good cops the bad ones ultimately take the spotlight, (and also although they may be good there’s also a chance that they just stand by and watch a crime committed by another officer rather than help the one who the crime is committed against).
5. Yes i can imagine that scenario, it would be unfortunate yes but it might make the police force change how they do things to encourage people to join them. How they do this i don’t know. 
6. This situation “if you called and no one came” is unfortunately the reality for people today, sure an officer may turn up but they might do so little that it’s as if they never arrived, an example( this could be false but there is many similar so i believe most of it) of this is on tiktok there is at least one story where someone who is being abused, by a parent or a partner, has called the police to try to get out of the situation, and the police have just asked the abuser if everything is okay instead of talking to the abused separately. There is also the more mainstream argument when people say this and it is in response to someone saying what if you get robbed “What’s the police going to do, write down a few words on paper and never ask about it again”, personally i’ve never been robbed so i can’t speak on the validity of this claim but i have seen it so much i’m inclined to agree, i am aware that not all robberies will be dealt with like this but the fact that even a small amount are is incredibly worrying since even 0.1% can be a high number.
7. in my opinion the balance should be through the training, if they are taught more about how to respond to someone and not to shoot on impulse then that will cause an increase in police related deaths, of course if an officer has undeniable reason to believe that he will be shot, he can still shoot, but otherwise he has to try to calm the situation or to listen to the person, or the people around, the person who he suspects</div>

That’s the only time it can be justified. Also there’s at least 4 cases of people getting hit in the head with the rubber bullets so i don’t think they should be used.</div>
