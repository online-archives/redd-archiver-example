The liberals are killing them.

And eventually everyone wakes up.  You see people on the left snapping every day.  It's due to a weak psychological hierarchy lefties tend to have.  Too many of them worship government and government is fallible.  

Have you ever noticed that people on the left who are religious handle things better than the ones who aren't?  It's because they put a metaphysical belief towards the top of their hierarchies.  Thus if government falls out of favor with them... their world is still okay.  But when you worship government and your god (government) betrays you... it's a hard pill to swallow.  

I mean you have lefties who have be driven to such insanity that they buy guns and shoot at conservatives.  

Hey liberals... where's your god now?  lol          </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">...this guy has no idea what conservatives are about.  He knows absolutely nothing about their party and he wants to make judgement calls.  

Conservative:  holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation, typically in relation to politics or religion.

Conservatives are anti abortion.  So it should be no surprise that they oppose abortion now should it?  I mean fucking duh.  You don't even know what the fuck conservatives are about and you're acting outraged that they're following their own doctrine.

Consider yourself blocked.  

Word of advice.  Learn what the fuck you're talking about before you start making judgment calls.

I was in r/cringeanarchy and made a comment at someone who happened to be a mod of reddittopminds.  So he went into reddittodminds and banned me.  

He went to another subreddit I was part of, where he had power because he's powerless in r/cringeanarchy, and banned me where he could.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; You're right, but the Republican party doesn't offer much in the way of leadership, either.

I get sick of hearing people cry "but they did this."  As if it's a valid argument when it's nothing more than pure deflection and it's a lie.  

The Republicans/conservatives do have a message and direction.  Their message is "we defend the constitution and believe in safety and security."  That's where they stand and it's where they have stood for a very long time.  People like you don't understand that because you're looking past it.

Look at what they are doing.  They're strengthening ICE to purge the illegals from the nation, the supreme court has approved of Trump's travel bans and they are upholding their values.  They're also passing laws to prevent things like Sharia law from destroying American values.

It is you that lacks objectivity.  Conservatives are about conserving American values.  They're not about making radical changes and pushing towards globalism.  

Also I got some news for you.  There is no moral high ground in this world.  That's just some shit you tell yourself.  Every country has done some pretty terrible things and places like Canada, the UK and Germany are doing some extremely shameful things to their citizens by suppressing their freedom of speech and imprisoning them for speaking their minds.

Trump has made more progress than you give him credit for.  You just don't like the guy because he's not a traditional president.  He's a shit talker and he'll tell you exactly how he feels and that's one of his virtues.  Cause he can be rather honest in telling you what he thinks and he's not afraid to change his mind.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well to be fair... what else can the liberals do at this point?  

I mean have you really looked at the stats lately?  The democrats have been utterly destroyed.  The liberals have caused a massive rift within their party that prevents them from having a unified message America will accept.  They don't have a working platform, they don't have a message, they don't have real leaders... they have nothing.  

Reddit is a liberal safespace.  This is all they have left to retreat to.  So they tell themselves lies for comfort instead of addressing the issues and at the same time they try to suppress the fact that democrats are jumping ship.  

It's beautiful.  I have an entire mod team sending me harassing PMs now because they finally broke under the pressure.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I said something in r/cringeanarchy and mods in reddittopminds lost their shit and banned me from their subreddit and now they are freaking out crying at me in PMs.  They're having a meltdown and it's absolutely hilarious.     

It's not enough to suppress the truth now they outright attack it.  So of course they are going to try and downplay their defeats.  You don't see them talking about the Dakota pipeline and how it's operational either.  

They are a defeated and desperate group of losers.  They aren't going to act fairly.  They're going to be the biggest bigots on the face of the planet and live in complete denial until they snap under pressure.  

Interestingly enough that will make reddit thrive, as misery loves company and there are plenty of miserable liberal losers here.  It will destroy the integrity of reddit and in the long term... doom the platform, but it will also be a great show.  

This is a daytime drama for me.  I love this shit cause it's not fake.  These fools are real and when they freakout it's not scripted at all.  It gives me great satisfaction to watch these fools burn in their own fire.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">These people are holding onto a thread and everyday some of them have their threads break.  When this happens they lose their minds to different degrees and this false hope they put in the MSM lies... and only makes their fall that much worse.  Because there's nothing more dangerous than a weak ideology and false hope.  

This is what Nietzsche was worried about when he said "God is dead and we killed him."  Nietzsche wasn't a fan of the god theory, but he knew the value of having a metaphysical belief at the top of your psychological hierarchy.  he knew that normal people were weak and needed such. 

People with metaphysical beliefs at the top of their hierarchy have a foundation that can never truly be destroyed, but people without metaphysical beliefs are very vulnerable to psychological collapse/nervous breakdowns as their ideologies can be challenged and destroyed.  Which can bring into question all their beliefs and leave them in despair or a personal hell.  

Those people who are angry and rioting in the streets... they worshiped government and now government (their god) has betrayed them and that brings into question all of their beliefs.  They cannot psychologically withstand the fact that their god has, in their eyes, betrayed them and it is shattering their reality.  Look at the chaos these people live in.  They're so lost they don't even know what is real anymore.  They believe in 50+ genders, that a man is a woman as long as he dresses as a woman and all sorts of other madness.  They desperately seek a holy grail (virtue) to cure their sickness.  Yet they will never obtain it and as this reality grips them they descend further and further into hell.

Throughout all of humanity's history... we have believed in the metaphysical and used such belief to set rules for how to treat one another.

The Bible and many other faiths have warned that those without metaphysical beliefs will end up attacking those who do, but I don't believe they're doing this just out of smite.  I believe it's also the drowning man syndrome.  These people are desperate, drowning in their own hells and grasping onto anyone who isn't drowning in an attempt to either bring you down with them or desperately use you to bring themselves back up.  

If you pay close attention you will realize... they are not seeking the approval of one another.  They seek the approval of the metaphorical father figure which is those who disapprove their actions.  

An example would be a movie/tv show where there's the hardass father figure like Red from That's 70's show who always disapproves of what his son does, but on those rare occasions where Red looks at his son and gives him his approval... the music changes and they share a very special moment where the kid finally feels validated.  Suddenly whatever he suffered is okay because his father approves him and thus he knows he has done good and can be at peace with himself.

Sadly that's just not going to happen for liberals.  So everyone can just look forward to those children losing their shit for the foreseeable future.

It happens to liberals all the time.  They join the group because they want to part of some cause they believe is noble.  Then the group narrative changes, they don't agree with the new narrative and find themselves being labeled the enemy.  The tools they once thought were fair to use are now used against them and they realize (all too late) that it's wrong.  

It's "good intentions" instead of good actions that lead people to ruin.  </div>

I've noticed liberals in general don't tend to think ahead before making decisions.  Like when they destroyed part of the filibuster system thinking that Hillary would be the next president only to have conservatives take over everything and use their weapons against them.

It kinda like dating a girl who cheated on her boyfriend to be with you.  If she'll do it with you then she'll do it to you.  So it's better to play fair or fuck whores without emotional attachment.  </div>

You can blame feminists for igniting the fire under 4chan's ass.  They should have never messed with video games.    </div>

That is if you're from the doctrination that doesn't listen to opposing views because they are the enemy and you must not have an open dialog with the enemy.  So liberalism or scientology.  Take your pick.  lol   </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm sure you can ban people, but they can come right back and bot some more.  I mean anyone dedicated to shitposting with a bot could flood multiple areas all at once and more or less pollute the social environment till it becomes toxic.  The mods would be constantly burning out trying to prevent it.  Which would sour the reddit milk so to say.  The_Donald recruits new temp mods every month because they are constantly under attack.  So other subs would have to do the same.    

Another scenario is... you get rid of all the conservative views, but then the SJWs will just go on witch hunts either suspecting conservatives are hiding among them or lashing out at one another for not having the exact same opinion.  We've all seen them eat their own and that will also lead to an eventual death.    

It appears these people with their agenda have diversity in everything except diversity of thought.  This website looks more like tumblr everyday.  </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">One of the problems with allowing things like this is the other side will eventually learn these same tactics.  In essence they created an arms race.  So we're currently heading in a direction where both sides will start heavily botting each other.  That will destroy what little integrity this site has, open up opportunities for other sites to scoop up reddit's disenfranchised members and sour the milk for potential advertisers.  

I mean the moment information like this goes public and reddit gets accused of mass botting to boost their figures... advertisers will start steering clear of the site the same way they ran from youtube.  

So the problem really should be addressed unless reddit wants to become the next MySpace.  </div>
