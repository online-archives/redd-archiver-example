<p>Transistor technology can't match the power efficiency for neural nets that evolution has come up with. It's my opinion that evolution hasn't come close to scratching the surface of how far neural technology could be pushed, it was a random-ish process working within very limited constraints and materials. </p>
<p>Evolution had to solve the problem of how can I design a matrix multiplication, adder, and softmax function with living  cells via fucking over millions of years in an extremely chaotic environment. It also has to be robust enough to survive all the crazy shit that happens to living things, this obviously must reduce potential performance. </p>
<p>With a much smarter engineer at the wheel than evolution, with unlimited materials, construction techniques, and extremely controlled environments, I see extraordinary and scary potential. Transistor tech will be a very useful tool as the glue for building, training, interfacing with such a system, but it will not be doing the heavy lifting. </p>
<p>Could you train a NN to solve the problem of how to tap on the surface of a body of water in such a way that 3 seconds later, it very briefly flashes an image of your face? Go down the rabbit hole of where that could lead. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Neural nets can be programmed in any language that can handle basic math and variables. 
Some will be much faster at it than others. </p>
<p>If you really care about performance you will use hardware acceleration instead of half-assing it on a CPU or even GPU or FPGA, such as IBM TrueNorth and SyNAPSE, which they say has the equivalent neural power of a mouse. There's nothing stopping you from just hooking up 1,000 of them in an array, if they were available to purchase for us plebs. </p>
<p>If you wanted to make a breakthrough in AI that frees the world from the grip of the silicon industry, and possibly summon the demon that is the super-intelligent AI of our nightmares, you would create an analog computer system to do it. I've figured out research paths to making this reality but don't have the time to invest in it myself, and I am super paranoid about the intentions of any groups willing to fund such an endeavour . To any inquiring computer engineer minds, roll around the idea of making an analog computer out of the surface of a liquid body and see where it takes you.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Bill Gates is a very controversial figure on voat, rightly so, but he did get this right.</p>
<p>“I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.” </p>
<p>Hiring a large team to work long hours on software isn't ever the right way to go. There are very, very few pieces  of software out there that require such a large team. If it still seems you need a large team, it's almost certainly because you haven't found a smart and lazy enough person to properly address your project. If it can ever be done more simply by a smaller team I believe you'll be ahead of schedule, under budget, and have a superior end product.</p>
<p>it's basic quality over quantity.  people will pick this up if they try to outsource software development to India, 50 god damn Indians working for the same price as a couple Americans might sound like a good deal, but it doesn't work. </p></div>

<p>The first line of the assignment indicates to me you are not really expected to be doing this with classes, but rather loops and functions. </p>
<p>Make a list of all the functions you think you'll need to do this, and start fleshing them out. You could of course do it all in one function, they are just to help you organize. You'll want a function for saving the file, collecting the order information, calculating it, displaying the results, etc.</p></div>

This is VERY, VERY basic. It isn't going to get any easier. It's going to get much harder, soon. Buck up or become the 2/3rds college statistic. Stop slacking off, learn the shit, do the work, this plea for help is an embarrassment and could get you in deep trouble with your school if you continue, I would highly suggest you delete all traces of this and put your head down in your notes. </p>
<p>-Sincerely, a fellow college drop out</p>
<p>FYI I would have helped you if you had posted good code of a solid attempt but couldn't get it working. </p>
<p>As a starting point, rewrite this gibberish assignment into terms and math that are clear to understand, then put that math into code. That is the biggest thing stopping anyone from helping you more, it's just tedious and you need to do it. </p></div>
