I told them that I don't really care about my ban, I had just wanted to know the reason, but that I thought they messed up pretty badly by including you, who should be considered a model member. Hopefully that helps speed up the process for you. Good luck.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah I checked your post history a little bit because I was curious and clearly you are the model user for most of the subs that blanket banned. You will see that mine is 90% help posts in small car subs. I consider myself in the center, SRS does not appeal to me, some of what they post seems pretty intended to be jokes to me and I think it is overreacting, but I also do not read the subs that slant the other way. I try to stay away from jerking it either direction.

The 'worst' I have done is say maybe we should give Trump a chance immediately after the election since he was the president now and maybe we would be wrong. Clearly we weren't and he sucks, but I wanted him to get to prove he would be a terrible president and not just an asshole first.

What irritates me the most is that I'm open minded. If I advocate for anything it is for reasonable discourse as I truly believe that most (not all) confrontations are rooted in miscommunication and small differences of a opinion, where even if two people will never agree, they can at least understand where the other is coming from and they don't need to hate each other.

My mind is a little blown that I've laughed at the idea of a reddit SRS cabal when now it appears to be half true, as I do not think they are necessarily SRS but they obviously do exist. I'm not sure what they were hoping to accomplish but I for one am even more convinced that freedom of speech and dissenting opinion are more important than feelings than ever. 

I hope your ban gets overturned because your history shows that even if you don't agree with a person you can discuss things like an adult and reddit (and the world) needs more of that. For myself, I'm just going to +filter them and move on with my life, I suppose.
