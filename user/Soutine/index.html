    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is all very interesting. How you became this way. I don't get it, because it's so alien to reality.

You say: We don't remember how we treated women blacks and gays. As if that excuses how we treated women blacks and gays. And yes I do remember. So let me tell you, it was shit and America has never been perfect. 

Your rights are taken away when you get put in prison for what you say. It can happen under a bad government. This is basic knowledge of how countries work. Look at Turkey or Russia for recent examples.

You say: The U.S. isn't a representative democracy, because you personally do not like the Washington Post. The Washington Post has nothing to do with it, that was just the link explaining it to you. But here, have a very well cited Wikipedia article instead https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy
But that stuff doesn't work on you, your mind will just contort itself into any shape it can go deny even Wikipedia. Not healthy!

And this:
&gt;You can't explain why I'm a bigot.

And

&gt;Please say one thing I've said that's hateful

Later in the very same text:

&gt;Islam is a political theocratic dictatorship that spits on the United States... Their ideology is absolutely worth killing them for.

I'll just... I'll just leave that there. I know you can't see it, but that's the very definition of a hateful bigot (and worse words can also be used.)

Why do you keep talking about communism even after I said I despise it? Are you a closet commie? Do you actually love communism, and that's what makes you keep going on about it even when no one else mentions it? Communism is a sick and ineffective idea, stop thinking about it so much!

Anyway it was interesting seeing how a hateful bigot justifies their unpatriotic (going against the American Constitution) and undemocratic (denying people their faith) opinions. Now I know, and it was very incoherent but strangely resistant to facts. But I have no doubts you mean well inside. I'll leave you with the wise words of Imam Ali, preaching words of islamic ideology you would kill him for

&gt;See the bad within yourself, and see the good within others.

&gt;Free your heart from hate, for hate is a sickness. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; Change is usually bad

A person claiming this must not know much about history. When was america ever perfect? Do you even remember how women, black people and gay people have been treated in the U.S.? Change is the single reason why the U.S. doesn't still share the values of Nigeria.

Rights are still something made up by man, and can be taken away by man at any time. And they are made up from democratic values. In fact, the minute the U.S. stops being a democracy is the same minute our "god given rights" will be gone. But I see you explained now that you understand that it is just a phrase, and you don't in fact believe they were given by God. So then you are aware that they are a democratic values which will disappear if we don't guard against it.

You keep going on about how you don't understand democratic values, here is a short explanation so we can settle that part: http://www.ushistory.org/gov/1d.asp

And the part about you not thinking the U.S. can be a democracy and a republic at the same time: 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/13/is-the-united-states-of-america-a-republic-or-a-democracy/?utm_term=.c8fbccd97a80


I am not saying you are a bigot as an ad-hominem attack, I am stating it as a fact because of how you broadly and negatively you are generalizing a third of the worlds population. I am not comparing you to muslims to in any way denigrate you, I am trying to show you how your thinking is the same as that in Iran. So you can see how similar we all are and ease off your hatred. Just swap the names about and your words could just as easily come from the mouth of an imam. This is not an insult, it is just a statement which is true, that I thought might open your eyes.

I get you have been primed with a fear of the ghost of communism. I despise communism as much as you do, so I don't understand why you're bringing that up all the time.

And I'm not bashing Christianity. Christianity, Judaism and Islam can all be wonderful and they mostly are when practiced in the right way. It's just that they are old medieval constructs which I believe we should move away from. I'm not an atheist though, just not a follower of any religion. I don't "defend and insult muslims". You are focusing on the wrong thing. I am defending the basic western democratic principle of freedom of religion. Which you are attacking, seemingly unaware that in your criticism of muslims you are attacking the American Constitution itself. Which is quite the definition of being un-patriotic.

Thomas Jefferson:

&gt;Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.[9]</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I think you're getting confused about the whole individuality aspect. A democracy must protect individual rights at all times, that's a core democratic value, the concept of human rights. Also freedom of speech and freedom of religion and freedom of the press. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That is what you spit on to further your religious bigoted fanaticism. 

But individuals must also band together with other individuals if they want to create change. That's just reality, sorry. 

And if you believe courts will protect you if you murder a government official doing his job... That's just not going to happen.

And then came the deal breaker:

&gt;God given rights

You say that human rights are not an idea constructed by men, but something that God came down to earth to give some guy to put in writing. That makes you exactly the same as an imam or fanatic Muslim.

Thanks for giving me insight into how your mind works. It is much similar to that of an Islamic fanatic, I'm telling you this though I know you will not take that in. The problem with people sabotaging western culture is not Muslims. It's religious and political fanatics which are both Muslim and Christian like you. 

You're the same. We can have a great western culture if this religiousness and disrespect for values of democracy that you and fanatic Muslims share, keeps fading away. 

Also, the U.S. is a democracy as well as a republic. Don't spit on the American flag, show respect to the values that let you have your unpatriotic opinions legally.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You very much missed the point of why your view belongs in Iran or Saudi Arabia. Was that on purpose? Try thinking about it again. The way you think about Islam, is how they see Christianity. Do you understand that? Can you grasp that concept, that you have the same views as them, just with swapped names for religions?

I think your view on individualism is an illusion created for you by your government and major corporations so they can use and abuse you as they see fit. They fear crowds, they fear unions, individuals apart are very easy to control and have never succeeded in creating any change at all. Only as leaders of large groups can people together with others create change. And you will never individually protect your own rights. "Taking a gun to the government" as you say will only lead you to a long jail sentence. That is reality.

That you spit on democratic values only further solidifies the case that you should move to Saudi Arabia.

 
It seems you are attributing general basic human behaviour to Islam. All those negative traits, which I agree are very prominent in various Arab countries, are the same also in all other equally poor ignorant cultures in the world. Or is Rwanda a bastion of peace and tolerance to you? 

This is what bigotry is, you attribute all negative parts of humanity to something foreign, because don't like that it applies to you too.

Individual rights are a part of democratic values. They are an idea we've made up, along with freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Respect the Constitution, and respect democracy. You see clearly how countries are when they don't do this.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes I understand your point. It is unfortunately undemocratic and you would probably feel more at home with your opinions in Iran or Saudi Arabia. Here in the west we have freedom of religion and other democratic values to uphold. So this mentality you're stuck on now is just as dangerous to western culture as fanatical Islam. We must be clear on our democratic values and fight bigotry in all forms, be they religious or political like yours. 

Yes, fanatical religion is bad. Because of intolerance and discrimination. We don't fight that with more intolerance and discrimination.</div>

But anyway, tolerant countries are less religious in general. We can look at Christian countries in Africa to still see great Christian intolerance. So the difference isn't between Islam and Christianity, it's between religious countries and less religious countries. The less religion the better.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Interesting thinking about deeper cultural roots behind religion. The culture of our religion is of course originally middle eastern, but it has evolved as it has spread over the world. 

One thing to recall is also that our western ideas of tolerance and equality are quite new even to us. Only the past 70 years have they truly evolved. 

What did we do before that? Well, let's not forget Christians  invaded basically every country on the planet and killed and raped and dominated the local populations of the whole earth. I don't mean this in an especially negative sense, it's just expanding on what all humans had been doing for thousands of years before. But let's not pretend that Christians didn't do it more than any other.

So what happened to trigger our age of relative justice, peace and tolerance? Well first after hundreds of years of constant wars we came to the point where we slaughtered almost an entire generation of millions upon millions of young men on an industrial scale in just one war. Then with the next generation we did it again even worse. With truly industrial methods of mass-slaughter wiping out whole populations in a destructive global chaos never before seen in history.

Until we reached a level of technology where we realised we will actually wipe out the entire human race if we continue. That is where we're at now. We know that the next big war can end humanity. So we better get tolerant. There hasn't been a proper war between major powers since ww2 and the age of the nuclear bomb started. We've just fought proxy wars in the Middle East.

So the people there haven't gone through this massive harrowing violence which we did, wiping out entire generations. So their thinking is still kind of stuck where ours was before all our men killed each other. 

Yes we are more culturally developed, but we got there through unprecedented bloodshed. And if we misstep again humanity as we know it will be lost. Geographical and historical perspective can help a lot in understanding where we are now.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Interesting points.

I think what you will see correlates more clearly with western values is *lack* of religion instead of any specific religion. The most progressive countries are the least religious in general.

When talking about intolerable Christians you are forgetting about a whole continent. A redneck American and a redneck Rwandan I think will have quite different Christian values. Christian country Uganda kills gays.

So you can use Africa as an example to compare countries on a similar level but with different religions. Rwanda, Uganda or Ghana etc can let you compare them to U.A.E. or other muslim countries.

I don't mean to criticize Christianity, any religion if used right can be great. But being open minded I think maybe africa is the key you're looking for if you want to make fair comparisons.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's cool. Sounds like you're​ on the way to looking at things objectively. Yes there are many values in developing countries which are inconsistent with western values. Many of those developing countries are Muslim, but there are also plenty of Christian countries with horrible values and laws. 

That's why we have to vet individuals, not religions. If they ban Muslims but let tons of gay hating woman abusing Christians in then they've failed. Religion is just a very sucky metric to judge an individual by. Individuals apply for green cards, and it's made clear that western values of democracy, freedom and equality are what people are signing up for when they move. If the individual is not fit for that and has no good reason to enter, he shouldn't be let in.

Also, the opposite of religious ignorance isn't cultural ignorance, it's education and enlightenment. The American schoolsystem needs a haul over.</div>

But they don't like to talk about how many Christians are killing Christians, then they easily change the criteria to socioeconomic status or psychological problems. But if you're brown it's all because of Islam.</div>

And the people wanting to kill all Muslims or carpet bomb the whole middle east are not as few as you're trying to make it out to be. Plenty of them in r/uncensorednews and The Donald. There's a difference between crazy people who want to share bathrooms with the other gender, and crazy people who want mass genocide of a third of the humans on earth. </div>

It seems as if you're stuck on a detail explaining human behaviour and acting as if it's significant because you're emotionally upset about how foreign it feels to you. Abrahamic religions are all crap, let's focus on criticizing more concrete things like behaviour and specific culture instead. There's plenty to criticize about different backwards cultures, Islamic and Christian alike.</div>
