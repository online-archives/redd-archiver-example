    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If we can use throwaways to hit the trigger words all over subreddits on the brink of ban, that trigger the bayesian classifiers (ml algs) that report content over threshold for abeyance of reddit policy, thus causing admins to ban hundreds more subreddits, then that's a feedback loop that could result in an exponential solution.  The artful troll uses the energy of the opponent against themselves.  Each new subreddit banned throws a fresh supply of gasoline (anger being the key ingredient to virality) on the fire.   

The advertisers who initially posed the little ultimatum on reddit who started this little kerfuffle are going to be sorry they brought it up and just wish we went back to earlier times.  We're way past that jerry, come on out.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; they [muslims] are exactly the same as christians. Down to their core beliefs.

Not true.  Christians don't believe in male ownership of females and females being non people, Muslims do.  Jesus didn't command Christians make continual warfare with everyone who isn't Christian, but Mohammad did instruct all Muslims to make continual warfare with everyone who isn't Muslim.  

The statement that christianity is the same as Islam is the ignorant intellectual opinion.  Yes, all Muslims are ISIS.  Islamic State isn't a religion, it's an entire system of civilization stem to stern.  The religious component is only a part of it.  islam is government, military, social services, technology sector, the whole 9 yards.  

My, and uncensorednews's effectiveness at proving this to be the case is why the sub was taken down.  Give me another hour to persuade you, and I can.  As I have countless others.  The data is there.  Your grandfathers carried out a first and second crusade against the Muslims, and they were on the sight of right.  Trump may be creating the conditions for a 3rd.</div>

I'm the one calling party foul on all the above using effective communication and proof in no uncertain terms, and I'm the one who don't understand what is and isn't appropriate?  

Things are not as black and white as you make them out to be.  You can't just point at someone and say: "racist" and then automatically win the argument.  You have to show that hating ISIS fighters in the middle east is a bad thing when condemning someone who says ISIS fighters should be killed.  This is hatred toward a religious group, yet it's not wrong, because the world isn't as simple as you think.  You can't just be intolerant to other people's intolerance and say: "your intolerance won't be tolerated".  A deep inspection of the ethics of the situation shows that you're the one who needs to learn about acceptability.

This conversation is very deep and nuanced.  There's no one sentence recipe for determining rightness here.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The recent losses on the ISP net neutrality front are apparently spreading to other areas.  The progression of states that leads to what you're saying take many years to play out.  It'll take a lot more than a handful of nuked subs that had a lot of questionable content to lead the whole site to mutiny.  They timed this and suppressed things so that the great majority of reddit users will be completely unaware of what happened until after it's blown over.  So no, reddit has a lot of life left in it before it hits "2006 peak digg".

Personally I'm thinking that a permanent IP based shadowban would be what the doctor ordered, I waste too much time giving my best to strangers on this site already.</div>

"Fragile entitled leftists" is the theme for 2017 to 2018.  This is a retaliation from that hivemind feeling powerless and trying to score some little victories by silencing some free-speech areas.  In their defense, the communities banned were flying off the rails.  The trouble is the targeting strategy, there's a lot of garbage on reddit, and the stuff left untouched is still just as bad. </div>

You can't have the whole world Agamemnon, it's too big, even for you.

subreddit nuking is setting a precedent, they're willing to censor and have a big celebratory liberal democrat following, banning is a two edged sword though, so wherever we go and congregate will get taken-down.  So it'll have to be somewhere you're ok with damaging, one reinforcing leftist liberal democrat ideologies; the Californian ideologies from reddit leading that charge.

t_d overlaps some of the ideology of uncensorednews, liberal democrats are calling for the_donald to be banned next for being toxic and racist, basically all the hate CNN was pushing toward Trump in his run for presidency.
