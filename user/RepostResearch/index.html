    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't know about any of these things and I've learned to not go on wild goose chases based on baseless accusations on reddit. I've done this dozens of times, and it ALWAYS turns out to be hyperbole, clips taken wildly out of context, or downright lies. 


You all still repeat the "very fine people" lie. 


So show your work or take the F. 


How about some accusations against your party? Your side of the political aisle is unabashedly corrupt. They're willing to send our tax dollars and our soldiers to war in a country on the other side of the planet so "the big guy" can get his 10%. The big guys son sold access to his VP father and made millions in the process. They openly want to undermine our constituon and revoke basic human rights. They want to pack the court and open the borders in a feeble attempt to shift the demographic. They committed voter fraud and are weaponizing the justice system against their political opponents. Your congressional leaders are best known for insider trading and making millions off the backs of the working man. They want to genocide conservatives. Nobody is trying to hide it. They're proud of it. 


I'm not going to show evidence of any of this. I want you to take my accusations as fact, just as you want me to take yours as fact. </div>

What evidence of this do you have? Saying, "but they want to!" Isn't evidence. It's petulant. 


> Were the Nazis not genocidal until they seized power? Until they opened the death camps??


Your ultimate MAGA boogy man already had power for 4 years. No genocide happened. In fact, most of the things you folks accused him of, the democrats ended up doing. </div>

Aside from these behaviors though, you're welcome to voice your opinions and respectfully debate.

"I like to debate and usually civil"

Commented on /r/protectandserve




> Oh no dont block the rich people from getting to their drug fueled orgy!! That was a good protest, I imagine they'll get more attention than they expected. That cop was unhinged and of course not responding proportionally to the situation. Reminds me of the George Floyd protests. Oh btw the desert there is basically a big flat parking lot most of those ppl could've just went around.

EDIT: banned from bootlicker central, I'll consider that a badge of honor. Good day bootlickers!




Again on /r/protectandserve




> That's rich coming from a cop lol.. 7 years in the infantry and there's only a couple jobs im qualified for, being a cop, and rolling burritos.
