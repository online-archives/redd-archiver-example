Really people can talk about cultural Marxism like we all signed up to a group email to destroy the west (oh how I wish it was real) . 

But is there concrete evidence for it? That communists and socialists are infiltrating every facet of society with Marxist culture?  If we are doing it, nothing is happening because both the big two of US and UK are still inbetween third wave and neoliberal in policies

Calling genetic fallacy doesn't negate that the two ideas are pretty much identical if you ignore the Jew parts (though just from that thread you can see some are committed to that as well). The same flaws in the Nazis cultural bolshevism and it being propeganda, can usually be found in the idea of "cultural Marxism". No they're not the exact same by they are family.

It's been debunked by so many people at this point, the Threw Arrows and Shuan on YouTube have both had great takedowns of this idea. 

And everyone here forgets Marxism was born in the west by a Brit and a German, and not by the "evil Muslims" or by Russians.</div>

That's not evidence. Explain how that is evidence. Anyone can post a few photos and a headline and call that evidence, doesn't make it so. Facts don't care about your feelings. 

Again how does any of that implicate the left?

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">None of these "implicate" the left in being "pro pedophilia"

The first story is dubious at best and not even sourced. Which isn't surprising because it's obvious what has happened when you watch the whole video. They mentioned pedastry one time in the curriculum as an example of how societies views on sex change. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-pedophilia-school/ Snopes already debunked this one bro, by your logic if you teach about the existence of anything you're endorsing it which is not how education works. How is you failing to actually look at the syllabus "the lefts" fault?

The second story is basically someone not doing a background check. How is that the lefts fault? 

Third story again, how does Bill Clinton maybe being a pedo the lefts fault? I wasn't aware the left said "oh by the way Clinton can you rape kids for us? It's on our evil Jewish agenda"

Literally no connection with those stories and us lefties, use critical thinking and actually research stuff before you believe it.</div>
