    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My wife got my 8 year old account that I used to stay connected with Marines banned by r/conservative. I had asked a sarcastic question which resulted in a ban. My wife, months later, got into reddit (bc of a hobby) and commented on r/conservative. 

I didn't think to tell my not to comment on that sub. When she did, reddit dropped the ban hammer. 

Initially I thought I could appeal it as I wasn't circumventing the r/conservative ban. It sucked to lose my name as I was very active in r/USMC.

Ultimately, it was my fault. I should never have put myself in a situation like that. There's no point in engaging that echo chamber. Thanks for reading my vent</div>
