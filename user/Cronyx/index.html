    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;the mods of a subreddit will reply to it in the same way, in almost all cases: with an instant, permanent banning. 

Wow. What a great example of a complete lack of accountability coupled with unlimited power. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Every subreddit turns into an echo chamber punishing the most heterodox positions. As those positions, and who promulgates them, are defenestrated, the bar continues to migrate further upward towards greater and more vehement compliance and leader praise. The party members eat eachother in a series of ever increasingly severe purity tests to prove they aren't disloyal to the party narrative. With each subsequent purge, the crimes that are deemed purge worthy must become more trivial due to economies of scale in the marketplace of outrage. You can't even safely remain consistent with your own position, because no matter how safe and reasonably moderate your position seems in the moment, as the flames of heresy burn upwards, they force everyone away from them to the higher ground of ever more extreme positions. If you remain stationary in your position, yesterday's moderate becomes todays's heterodoxy, and tomorrow's heresy, and you'll burn along with them. This cycle must be broken, culturally wide, or 2021 will be even worse than 2020. It's going to be a rough ride.

&gt;In the case of r / WritingPrompts, I was told
&gt;
&gt;"No prompts referencing real world drama (including politics, recent tragedies)."
&gt;
&gt;so I guess the Black Death must have been recent. Who knew?  🙄 

Did you point that out in a reply? That this could be *any* kind of plague, even a zombie plague, or like *The Stand?* This is really something that should be argued a lot further.

Reddit also needs a kind of "Supreme Court" and a proper appeals process to deal with these situations of power abuse.</div>

I feel like "be faster" is a bad faith reply. It discourages good faith, reasoned, balanced, and researched grass roots journalism, and encourages a "fire from the hip, be first" practice, that sacrifices accuracy to advanced narrative.

Where is the place for long-form, traditional journalism?</div>
