The only thing that could be asked here is WHY was it changed for Covid specifically. They had been using protein boosters before without calling it a vaccine. So the method was already there, but it took until covid was out for them to change the definition of vaccine.  


Like a lot of things in life, always should see if there's something nefarious in the 'why' something is done or changed. It could be harmless, it could be that more people recognize vaccines as a good thing than protein booster which sounds like a weight lifting thing. It could be something to do with getting insurance companies to pay for it. This part I do not know.</div>

There are other ways to boost the immune system that included things like eating a lot of vitamin C or complete protein overhaul. The Covid vaccine is a lot like the latter rather than an injection of just the virus, it's protein or toxins.  


This would be similar to saying what the Japanese used to do by drinking a small amount of poison to build an immunity to it is a vaccine. Today's standard it probably could be called a vaccine.  


But knowing this, this isn't saying that using protein as a vaccine is a bad thing. It just their point is it had it's definition changed TO include the covid vaccine specifically.</div>

Yes, the Covid vaccines were rushed because they had to be, and especially since it came as a response to an outbreak that could and should have been prevented but the right people (cough fauci) kept all of it hidden until it became too big to hide. and then he kept lying until the lie became too unbelievable except to the weirdos who for some reason think "being for fauci makes me a good leftist and moral" which is a good tactic because the majority of people are idiots and actually DID believe it. But... less and less people are continuing to believe it.  


It's like the polio vaccine. The first version killed people. But after refining, it became one of the most effective with no side effect vaccines.</div>

It isn't loaded to call them cronies when Fauci literally uses the FBI to bully, arrest and silence people who speak against him. That is the fucking bill for being called a crony. The Covid epidemic wasn't just a bad judgment call, he was found to his Wuhan lab to not have been kept up to code, was performing illegal and unsanctioned studies there, and then it got out. That's why he tried to get the FBI to silence anyone talking about it until the lie couldn't hold up anymore. Don't you remember twitter and reddit also banning talks about wuhan?  Did you know they found out the FBI in the case of twitter was actually telling them they needed to ban accounts that talk about it?  


It wasn't about keeping people calm, it was about trying to hide his criminality and blunders again and again.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">First, I'm not saying he CREATED anything or intentionally released covid. The problem was the damage he did in his attempt to cover up his fuckups time and again...  


Except in the case of Opioids. That was him. He didn't create it, but he created the demand and the system of kickbacks that made doctors prescribe and then overprescribe it to get people addicted or killed by it. But then he washed his hands of it as if it wasn't him who lied about Opioids being safe when he KNEW they were addictive and in other contexts dangerous.  


But back to the coverups. That's what he's doing with Covid again. It came from Wuhan. His lab. His lab that didn't take proper mandated safety measures. That alone puts a stain on his credibility. So what does he do? GEt the FBI and other agencies to forbid people to even talk about it. The fact he went that far to censor people is still fucking evil. He did that with hormone blockers too, and HIV? The scandal starts with him 100% ignoring it because it was a 'gay disease' and only starting to care when 'straight white politicians magically got the disease, totally straight, amirite' and then what he did was campaign for donations and took tax money for 'AIDs studies'... so he was seen as a hero for a little bit of time, until you find out what he did with that money. Placebos and harmful 'pills' to kill the f\*\*s. Oh, but you may not know about that because once again fauci got the FBI to arrest and silence both LGBT activists and medical professionals calling him out for it and trying to make him responsible for the deaths.  


His career isn't to kill people, however, when he fucks up he's willing to kill more people to silence them and not hold any accountability.</div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I could give a lot of a reviews on it, as well as I wrote a 'fixed script' to try fixing the problems the show had.  


but the first problem was the world building.>! It had very little. For instance, they make a point that there's old magic (conservative republican) and new magic (democratic progressive) but didn't actually say what was different about them, they just arbitrarily decided "someone used old magic" and nobody viewing it understands why it's old magic vs new magic. Also old vs new magic was a lazy way to describe it. My fix here would have been old magic could have been something like Evocation where it required an oral component  and took too long, but while it took longer, the effects were better and new magic used arcana type magic assisted tools (staffs, magic globes, etc.) to create faster, near instantaneous magic but the effects of were less because of how much quicker the spells were to use, but make it a plot point that the speed came with another drawback such as taking mana from the air and plant nearby them so it would slowly decay the world. (There was a plot point about the Rot killing off the land, but we know nothing about it because while it was stated to be a central antagonistic plot, nothing was ever done with it).
!<

>!The second are the characters and hypocrisy. For instance, Rosemary is loud, obnoxious and completely self absorbed. So it's quirky and a fun! But she falls in love with a guy who is very much the same, and then he becomes a villain just because he has the same personality she has but is man, so now let's abuse men for doing the same thing a girl did. And by that I mean lots of physical assault. Rosemary also treats her sword like a toy, but nothing bad ever really comes from that, and she's supposed to be a 'warrior' type but is totally untrained so it makes it completely ridiculous just because her mama was some legendary swordswoman who never trained her.
!<

>!the lgbt issues were so saturated in this without making it relevant to the world it was kind of cringeworthy. And I say this 'as a gay'. When they drop the trans bombs, it's so unnatural. When they talk about lesbians, it's so forced and they also do it for the viewers because the characters who they're explaining they're trans/lesbian to don't react to it at all. The second trans (possibly) character Snapdragon could have been done well with his battle for identity between masculine and feminine, but the only thing we got from this was "maybe" and "bullied by toxic masculinity"
!<

>!The only character really done well was  Amaryllis who was designed to be a minor villain and we were supposed to hate her, except hatewatchers and fans alike actually loved Amaryllis (Crazy Axe murder Girl if you google it)!<  


basically... yeah, a lot of problems. and Genericusername went over some of it, but the show itself was controversial even before because crunchy roll asked for donations for JAPANESE animation studios and people donated a lot of money, but instead gave the money to a small studio of white girls who banked on being 'diverse' despite being only white girls  who were very much overpaid to make this shitty show and people wanted their money back because crunchyroll DID say it was going to go to Japanese animators. Not worthless flash students.</div>

this is closer to leftist totalitarianism where if you don't believe what they say unquestioningly and in the right order of words, it is to be destroyed. Or banned in this case.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">For context the thread was talking about a few different movies and shows and I said "I haven't watched star wars, but that's what other people say" and then talked about High Guardian Spice and it's awful writing and why it was awful and how it could have been fixed, but the writers didn't care.

So, I didn't complain about a movie I hadn't watched, none of the things I posted broke any rules, nor was I complaining about anything other than bad writing in a show?

And somehow this person went back way over a year to ban me for something not harmful. My guess is they actually liked High Guardian spice or some shit.</div>

but I can copy pasta at least!

The funny part of this is the post they found so offensive a year after was me saying I HADN'T watched some of the movies so I clarified what I said was what other people said about it and then went onto movies I had seen and was complaining about narrative pacing, motivation and general bad writing in some shows like High Guardian Spice.

But they're mad I said I hadn't seen star wars?</div>
