There's a whole conspiracy theory that this may be a set up to help Trump get elected as it appears the Mises takeover was funded in part by a Trump donor.  If that's the case they'll probably toss the body out the trunk after 2024 and we can revive it.  That said, the social right regularly tries to align themselves with pro-liberty movements and then corrupts them when they get enough people in the door so, who knows, they may stay.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">For hating MAGA and Republicans they sure act like MAGA Republicans.  They're doing a great job of removing libertarians from the Libertarian subreddit when they question Republicans, Trump, Abortion, or the Mises Caucus.

Further:

* They removed the abortion plank form the LP
* They removed the wording against bigotry
* They openly said they want to open the party up to social conservatives (which is why they did the first two actions).
* They regularly say things you'd expect to hear from the social right.  NHLP Twitter accounts have been called out by libertarians several times for saying stupid shit.

They're social conservatives, fullstop.  Hell their current big thing is using voluntary association to enforce their social code by not interacting with those who do not follow it; the grand vision being private cities that can expel those who don't follow the rules.  It's the new States Rights for them.  If what excites you the most about promoting libertarian values is the ability to enforce your will without a higher authority preventing you from doing so, you're just another authoritarian.  You're just one who knows your shit won't fly at a higher level and are settling for what little influence you can get.

They want to promote their brand of social right bullshit as though it's libertarian and don't want people like us calling out their bullshit and making their Trump supporting social conservative friend feel bad.  Its unfortunate but social conservatives have been trying to pass themselves off as libertarian for some time.  

I knew the Mises Caucus was bad, and that the take over was going to be destructive, but I guess I wasn't expecting them to get to the point of expelling libertarians.  It makes sense though, they are social conservatives after all.  I'm curious how much of this will happen at the Party level.  Hopefully it doesn't get further than Reddit but, social conservatives tend to be complete assholes, proudly so, so who knows.</div>

The social right Mises Caucus Mods took over the sub.  From what I've seen they're banning anyone who questions the social conservative Mises Caucus, Republicans, abortion, and/or Trump.  They're trying to purify the forum before the election, knowing that if there are actual libertarians on there we'll call out their social conservative bullshit.  

I guess they don't want their Trump supporting "libertarians" getting butt hurt over there, which in fairness they do seem to have some thin skinned social conservatives at this point who get really offended when you point out that Republicans aren't the good guys.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That explains why the list went private.  I'd thought it was easier to identify mods in the past.  As for volunteering I'm in Portland, OR.  I don't think there's much I can do because I doubt we have may libertarians here.  Our local candidates tend to be nut cases from what I can see, or at minimum they unfortunately come off that way in the voting material.  In fairness most of our politicians come off as completely nuts or just list pages of endorsements with some feel good bs.  Voting here is, awful, especially when you already have a good idea of the outcome and know you have no real say.

I hope to see more members join but, well like you said we'd need principled libertarians there to help guide new members but we're being purged in favor of social right extremists, at least here on Reddit.  They're almost certainly going doing this to try to sway people interested in libertarian philosophy away from classical liberalism and into their social right sphere.

Also glad to hear about great Mises volunteers.  I'd bet like most groups most of them are fine; their leadership though and the people who I think are most likely to act don't seem to understand libertarianism past how to attempt to fight progressives and weaponize principles to be exclusionary without government involvement.  All I see is the social right once again pretending to care greatly about individual rights and liberty, talking a big game about small government, all the while wanting to those limits to keep higher levels of government out of their way while they find way to force their values on others (in this case via exclusion as granted by freedom of association though I'm sure they'll find other methods or just go back to the idea of strong "love it or leave it" local governance).</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I mean, is it not the LP or is it the LP under Mises.  They seemed awful sensitive about something in my post, but it:

* Republicans being more likely to corrupt the LP than the LP being able to influence the GOP (I think we've all seen this, they flat out ignore us)
   * As evidence mentioned the takeover of the TEA Party by social conservatives (stated libertarian, then started seeming like social right bs.  When Sarah Palin was key speaker at an event I knew it was over)
* Abortion being a contentious issue in the LP
* The Mises Caucus still not convincing me that they're libertarians and not just social conservatives

The reason I was permanently banned is because "we have decided not to associate with you anymore", because apparently a few mods get to decide who the entire sub associates with.  I tried asking someone who I think is a mod there wtf is going on but haven't heard back (no idea if I will, we're not buddies or anything, was a shot in the dark).  Funny to see them weaponize free association.  After watching a Mentis Wave video where he was highly supportive of using free association as a means of social control it became pretty obvious that was the path of abuse that was about to appear from the right; the new States Rights if you will.

What I think is going on, given how friendly the Mises Caucus is to Trump supporters to the point that they apparently wanted to start a coalition with them is that they're doing just that.  They're purging actual libertarians in favor of their social right movement and the LP is dead.  Frankly I'd be surprised if the LP runs a real candidate this round for fear of taking votes from Trump.  They may not even run a candidate at all.  If they do, I'd suspect minimal support and the excuse of "stop thinking national, think local".

Hopefully I'm wrong, maybe it's just some Trumpers purging libertarians so that they don't look bad when we call them out, but this is what I thought would happen under the Mises Caucus so, really wouldn't be surprised if they've behind the purge.</div>

I messaged the admins, but they've done nothing about this.  It seems a clear violation of mod COC Rule 2, but doubt anything will be done about this:  [https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct)

&#x200B;

Edit:  I also find it concerning that a post regarding the US "Censorship Industrial Complex" as revealed in the Twitter Files was censored without explanation and without ability to have it overturned.  I'm very curious if this is standard stick up the ass moderation or something more.  I think a "Reddit Files" could be very revealing, though again it's just as likely this is organic and coming from someone who believes in censoring opinions based on facts which they refuse to acknowledge.

&#x200B;

Edit Again:  In case anyone wants the receipts on my claims:  [https://np.reddit.com/r/2ALiberals/comments/124ncrz/reddit\_is\_in\_full\_blown\_propaganda\_mode/je2isov/?context=3](https://np.reddit.com/r/2ALiberals/comments/124ncrz/reddit_is_in_full_blown_propaganda_mode/je2isov/?context=3)

&#x200B;

I keep forgetting that this stuff isn't universal knowledge because major media outlets have refused to air the content of the Twitter Files.  It's become a media litmus test for me at this point.</div>

Non-hateful, articulated, even fact based posts are apparently brigading now.</div>
