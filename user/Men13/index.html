        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Yes, until now he mostly took toy examples and considered them as if they were in a vacuum - completely missing the point of the example.</p>
<p>But he has raised a few very good points that I - as someone who HAS worked on a large number of big, complex projects with similar / recurring elements - have encountered and agree with:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In OO, who should be responsible for the interaction between two objects? &quot;Functions&quot; sound like a better option than &quot;randomly choose one of them&quot; or &quot;create a new interaction object&quot;. Example: readline between an std::istream and an std::string in c++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes - more often than I would have liked - I suddenly need access to the functionality of an inner object of an inner object of an inner object of the object I can see. The solution is annoying: create a set of &quot;proxy functionality&quot; for all the objects in the hierarchy. That is bad because: (a) I now need to create a ton of new tests for basically nothing, (b) I now need to &quot;change the story&quot; of each of these objects to explain why having that functionality makes sense with their &quot;design&quot; and (c) it's just a ton of extra code for something very small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Design&quot;, or &quot;what does this thing I need <em>really</em> mean&quot; is an interesting and fun exercise, but when you just want something that &quot;works&quot;, it's an annoying distraction that costs you money. How many times did you have code that actually did what you wanted perfectly, but you had to rewrite it from scratch because you found a better &quot;design&quot;? It happened to me very often. Is it worth it? In OO it's essential. But if it was programmatic? I'm not sure you need it then.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Small things make sense as objects - like strings and such. But even with strings - strings! - the rigidity of objects is creating problems. Want to add a &quot;write on change&quot; functionality where sub-strings are very cheap? Oh, sorry, your original design called for iterators to be persistent when changing a character. So you now can't do that very important thing that would have helped a lot and make some code substantially faster. Even when some people don't use iterators. Because OO. Too bad. </p></div>

<p>my experience, it's not necessarily an intelligence problem but rather a passion one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Exactly!</p>
<p>I remember when C++11 just came - I was so excited! I send all my free time (at home!) playing around with the new language features. I was reading about it for years before - when it was still C++0x - almost getting a boner about the auto and new for feature, and trying to wrap my head around promises and futures. And I wasn't alone - for months, all we talked about at work was this new thing or that new thing in C++11, and how we would write things differently, and how SFINAE works, and what we could use it for, and how we would change the codebase to take advantage of the new features and... and... and we were legitimately excited. Like the hype you get before a new video game / movie / whatever comes out.</p>
<p>Female programmers? No. They just &quot;OK, this is a new thing I need to learn. Hopefully I can just continue to work as normal&quot;. Not one looked like she would spend her free time excitedly reading anything she could find about the new features. They work, they go home, and at home they don't think or care about programming.</p>
<p>That's the difference I see.</p></div>
