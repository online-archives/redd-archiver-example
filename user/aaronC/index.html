        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>A good programmer is one who can use advanced algorithms and know when to apply them, while making code readable. Getting things to work is easy, specially in an age where you can get the answer to a lot of programming problems on stack overflow. You can do a lot with for/while loops and if/else statements, but there's almost always far better ways of doing things. I've had situations where I was using libraries and built in functions in PHP, I researched how they worked, and found out I could do it massively faster if I wrote my own stuff. </p>
<p>Bad programmers think everything is about the language, good programmers just view languages as a tool to implement algorithms that get computers to do what you want.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The most valuable knowledge for hacking is to know how everything works. Once you know how the OS, software, etc works (not just how to use it), you can start finding ways to break it. </p>
<p>Think of picking a lock. If you know how the lock works, you can carefully dissect it and break it open. If you don't know how it works (but you know how to use it), you can just kick it in or something. Obviously, kicking the door in makes it obvious you're there. Quietly picking the lock, however, doesn't really let anyone know. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The standards for completing computer science and technology degrees have fallen, because universities were not passing enough people. I've noticed too, that when you branch out from the main parts of the internet, you end up with a lot of broken stuff. People don't care any more. They also are being told they are capable of doing things when they aren't, and they're not being told they're incapable when they aren't capable. </p>
<p>Web development is easier than it's ever been. Browsers are standardized, there's no nightmares like in the IE6 and earlier days where every browser did things differently, and you'd be doing javascript hacks for each browser, and different stylesheets for IE. Now we have javascript frameworks and browsers do an extremely good job at following standards. PHP and other languages are extremely easy compared to things like Perl or CGI. You can now even use javascript for back end stuff. </p>
<p>We're heading in a direction where software is easier to make, and less talented people are making it. And they all think they're going to get rich quick. This is the result of letting people who hate math program. </p></div>

I suppose it only comes down to being in the USA. I highly doubt they'd use this if you're running a legit website to go after you, from what I've read basically ICANN can message you and tell you to change it or they can just take it away.

<p>This also explains it better. <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/2005/03/30/known-us-law/">http://www.politechbot.com/2005/03/30/known-us-law/</a> I guess doing it by itself isn't a felony, but if you get caught breaking any IP laws (which can be really easy to do), you can get in some serious trouble. Moreso than if you were just breaking those IP laws.  These bills passed a while ago and I guess no one really made a big deal over them when they were passed. </p></div>

I highly doubt they'd do it right off the bat, but technically in the USA it's a felony. It's worth the extra money on the whois guard just to keep yourself safe. Realistically, anyone who wants your domains could talk to ICANN and get them taken away if they can prove there's fake info there, which wouldn't be difficult if you're just writing in generic stuff. Not trying to fear monger, but it's the truth, you can verify this stuff if you like. </p>
<p>Whois Guard is pretty important, a while ago, people wanted to take it away, which means everyone who wanted to start any sort of site on their own domain name would have to basically give their full personal information to anyone who knows how to use whois. Some bad people use it, but it's a good service to have and you should be supporting it. An internet where small sites that don't have business addresses different from their home and they can't hide that fact is pretty scary. </p></div>

I know it's a meme, but you'll learn a lot from installing it. You can just do it in a VM too, no need to install it and start wiping parts of your storage. </p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>They bully people into accepting them. They create situations where you are in a lose lose situation yourself, and you choose between accepting their nasty CoC or being slandered. Example is you could have a project and not care what anyone is and only accept their code based on merit. And then they would show up and ask about the demographics of the project. And there, it's nearly impossible to make your employees/teammates/etc have a population that perfectly resembles the national population demographics. So they cherry pick where you're not &quot;diverse enough&quot; and use that to say you're some sort of *phobe or *ist and slander you and your project. Social Justice has developed a huge, contradictory web of crap and they can find something to harass you over no matter how much effort you put forth. This post is a perfect example: <a href="https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/814142/4036621">https://voat.co/v/programming/comments/814142/4036621</a></p>
<p>The sad thing is most people cave and don't want to be slandered and have their google results completely ruined, so they take the CoC. </p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/812483#4028102">Cultural Marxism and the attack on the OSS community</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The key difference is OSS is merit based and social justice is not. Social justice is just another term for affirmative action, except it's applied on a much greater scale. SJWs would rather have a team of 50% X and 50% Y representing population, even if it means turning away qualified people from the group they believe is privileged. </p>
<p>OSS looks at what you've done and judges you based on that. Social justice looks at you at what you are and judges you based on that. OSS is not quite communism. It has some far left ideas but it's much more akin to capitalism in the fact that you're much more heavily rewarded for producing something than not. </p>
<p>Your large mistake is you think Cultural Marxism is communism. It's not, it's communist theories applied sociologically. I.E. Marx thought all works should be taken care of according to their ability and according to their needs. However, Cultural Marxism is more along the lines of </p>
<blockquote>
<p>this group makes up X% of the population and only .5X% of this project
therefore we need to double the amount of that group to achieve parity
their merit doesn't matter as long as they fit the criteria for what they are</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a bastardization of communism and Marxist ideas applied to sociology. While it's very similar, it's not the same thing, and it varies on key points. </p></div>

They run around saying that they are women developers and just as good as men, but all they do is lurk repositories and complain about things. Well, I say that, but SJW is just a giant melting pot of talentless hacks of all genders and races that only have the ability to bitch about things as opposed to actually doing constructive things. </p></div>
