They muted me, too. Didn't tell me why. I'm guessing because I am a "Russian troll", aka anyone who disagrees with or questions the government and media.

Eventually these folks will realize what is going on and they will feel really silly. I suspect they're about to that point right now, which is why they are on a banning and muting spree, to protect their echo chamber and keep the charade going just a little bit longer.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I was also banned/muted from /r/activemeasures for questioning the narrative. The irony of their sub is they are an echo chamber of US propaganda, attacking anyone who questions it, calling everyone a traitor, which is exactly what the point of Russia's active measures campaign was, to get Americans to turn against each other. If the Internet had been what it is today back when Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, these people would have been online saying the same shit they're saying now. "Don't you care about 9/11?! Saddam is an evil doer! Look at all the terrible things he has done to his own people! He obviously planned the whole thing! If we don't invade Iraq and stop him he's going to use chemical weapons on innocent people! What, are you some kind of Saddam sympathizer or apologist?"

Really it was easy to get people to this state. It all comes down to Donald Trump. They managed to convince millions of Americans if people say X, Y, Z, they are Trump supporters. Literally that's all it takes. If they want people to accept or oppose a policy, they just tell them Donald Trump is for or against. It's actually a pretty handy tool to manipulate people. Almost like that's the whole point of Donald Trump.</div>

Well, probably because the director of the CDC, White House officials, media pundits, told people on live television and on social media posts to get vaccinated to prevent *getting* Covid. These folks want to pretend that never happened, but DefiantL's has reposted their posts multiple times. The Internet does not forget. And now they act like *you* are the crazy one for throwing their rhetoric back in their face, "We never, ever said that!"</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the perception of contradictory information. Relevant items of information include a person's actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, values, and things in the environment. Cognitive dissonance is typically experienced as psychological stress when persons participate in an action that goes against one or more of those things.[1] According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent.[1][2] The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.[1][2][3]

&gt;In When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World (1956) and A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the real world.[1] A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.[1][2] They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance (rationalization) or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance (confirmation bias).[1][2][3]

&gt;Coping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve the dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I mean, I don't really care to participate in those subs if they're going to promote the kind of environment where only Groupthink is allowed. Good idea though. Kinda funny that it's that easy to avoid their attempts at insulating themselves in a reality bubble. 

I just wonder what that conversation was like. "Hey guys, if Reddit isn't going to censor people that hurt our feelings and trigger us by spreading dangerous misinformation that goes against the gospel truth given to us by ole holy government, why don't we just shield ourselves from those people and ban anyone that posts on a sub we don't like?" Or did they think they were punishing people by preventing them from interacting with their subs? And what happens if someone realizes they made a mistake in exercising Wrongthink, is there some kind of forgiveness ceremony someone can go through to achieve cleanliness and be welcomed back into their incredibly important subreddits? 

It's hilarious how far the Left has fallen, from the 60s and 70s fighting for free speech and against censorship and authoritarianism, where they knew the government and the media couldn't be trusted... to today where they support censorship and authoritarianism and call anyone who challenges what the government and the media says a Nazi. And what's incredible is they don't see anything wrong with their behavior, with supporting censorship, or with hiding away from people they disagree with in their own little reality bubbles where they can circle jerk each other, or with applauding authoritarian tactics like trampling people with horses, or seizing people's assets and bank accounts.</div>

Update:

The bans just keep coming in tonight! /r/Netflix, /r/Gifs now too! Well, Netflix has almost nothing to watch on it anymore, so I'll just cancel my Netflix if the people running their subreddit are going to quarantine people from their subreddit who trigger them.

Seriously, imagine being so triggered by alternative views to yours that you ban people and quarantine them from your subreddit. Like Mencken said, "The final test of truth is ridicule. Very few religious dogmas have ever faced it and survived." They show their hand by how fragile their beliefs are that they need to shield themselves from ideas that cause them to experience cognitive dissonance.

Still, I'm not sure a website that makes its money from advertising and selling user data is going to be successful after it goes public when everyone stops using their platform because they were all banned for disagreeing with people who lick the boots of world governments, the White House, and the mainstream media.</div>

Reveling in the death of others doesn't build community, nor does targeting people for harassment and bullying. You can go through Reddiquette and the site rules and then look at HermanCainAward and many other subs and it's pretty apparent how they're violating TOS. If there were a sub dedicated to mocking your average person who died from Covid, or died from Covid after getting vaccinated, the people who are on HermainCainAward would flip out and brigade that sub and report it constantly and stop at nothing to get it banned, but it's totally OK if they're mocking someone who dies of Covid because that person didn't get vaccinated, or because they're a Conservative, or just because they simply don't like them.</div>

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's a bunch of redditors circlejerking every time an unvaccinated person dies.

Exactly! TopMinds, IAmVerySmart, and many other subs exist simply to harass, bully, and mock people. While I'm not a fan of censorship and feel like they have a right to do what they're doing, Reddit will ban other subs simply because enough people get triggered and report that sub, while the above mentioned subs are allowed to violate all of these rules and guidelines...

"Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off. Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit, just to name a few. Behavior can be harassing or abusive regardless of whether it occurs in public content (e.g. a post, comment, username, subreddit name, subreddit styling, sidebar materials, etc.) or private messages/chat.

Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line."

"Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence."

"Do Not... Repost deleted/removed information. Remember that comment someone just deleted because it had personal information in it or was a picture of gore? Resist the urge to repost it. It doesn't matter what the content was. If it was deleted/removed, it should stay deleted/removed."

"Do Not... Be (intentionally) rude at all. By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us."

"Do Not... Follow those who are rabble rousing against another redditor without first investigating both sides of the issue that's being presented. Those who are inciting this type of action often have malicious reasons behind their actions and are, more often than not, a troll. Remember, every time a redditor who's contributed large amounts of effort into assisting the growth of community as a whole is driven away, projects that would benefit the whole easily flounder."

"Do Not... Conduct personal attacks on other commenters. Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation."

"Do Not... Insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged."

"Do Not... Troll. Trolling does not contribute to the conversation."

"Do Not... Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons."

"Do Not... Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts."

"Do Not... Report posts just because you do not like them. You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules."

"Do Not... Editorialize or sensationalize your submission title."</div>

&gt; I have gotten accounts in trouble with the admins by reporting them here, this is an admin level report so the admins can take action regardless of what the mods do

Funny you should say that. I moderate a conspiracy subreddit called /r/conspiracyII. The person who created the sub 4 years ago had their accounts suspended about 3 years ago. The new top mod invited an alternate account of theirs onto the sub as a mod. 4 years later, literally all the guy who was suspended and friends of theirs they appointed to mod positions (or alternate accounts of theirs) were doing was posting mainstream media articles about "Orange Man Bad" and "Conservatives are Nazis" that weren't even related to conspiracy theories. They were basically using the sub to push their politics. These folks started removing posts from people based on their personal opinions, removed comments, and banned users who questioned them. We told them that they could no longer use the sub to push their political views by abusing the mod privileges and posting nothing but Red Team bad content as their only contributions to the sub and that they had to be balanced so the sub didn't turn into TopMinds or Politics. A few mods left, a couple had to be removed because they refused to stop. In fact, one of the mods who left is active on another conspiracy sub were literally all they do all day long every day of the week is remove posts of people that they disagree with. Not even posts that violate community standards, or Reddit TOS. If this guy disagrees with you, they immediately remove your post then ban you.

Anyway, the person who started the sub but lost control of it years ago began to make threats that they were going to destroy the sub, they said they were going to "tear it all down." They kept saying "You can't do this" and talked like they physically owned the sub. They threatened to "destroy" me and the top mod. They said they had "dozens of alternate accounts." They said they knew the admins and they were in contact with an "elder mod" who was going to help show me "who is boss." They said we had "no idea what they're capable of." They said we made a "big mistake." They said "COME. AT. ME." They said they've been doing this since we "were in elementary school." They said they were a "pro" and that they were "special" and that Reddit made changes based on their input alone. They said we we're "surely not cut out for this." They said "You're not a real Redditor." They said they wrote a 240k word manifesto to get all conspiracy subs banned and that they paid a data analyst to help them write it. They said they "don't need Reddit to post it" and that "Twitter works well enough."  They said, "You ever chat with Snoop Dogg, Val Kilmer, or Taylor Swift? I have. I've spent many years developing contacts like this... You two are hell-bent on picking a fight with a very serious and studious motherfucker--all because you want to rule over a baby-/conspiracy subreddit with 15 users." They said all kinds of crazy things. Reddit TOS violations, Reddiquette violations, Moddiquette violations out the ass. Tons and tons of threats.

After reaching out to Modhelp and Modsupport I took their advice and banned this person from the community, muted them, and reported them to admins. Immediately after this happened, some mod who moderates a dozen subs posted on our sub repeating everything the guy who started the sub said, but in a kind of veiled threat kind of way, like the person we're talking about told them their side of the story and they had come to the sub to scare us on behalf of them. They said they were there to offer assistance and all kinds of stuff that also violates Moddiquette and Reddiquette and Reddit TOS. It's actually a violation of moddiquette for a mod to go to other subs and tell them how to run them, let alone threaten them and put a ";)" after each veiled threat.

I reported all of this stuff to the admins. I posted in Modsupport to ask for help and advice and the people in question followed me there and started harassing me there. I reported them there and the mods of that sub who are admins just told me to report them to Reddit with the report form you linked. They didn't even remove the posts of the person who was harassing me and violating Moddiquette. I had admins contact me via email in response to my report form I filled out earlier in regards to the harassment from the person who established the sub 4 years ago, I told them about this new situation with the mod offering "assistance," and all they told me is report them if it happens again. I linked that admin to the conversations with hundreds of messages where the founder of the sub violated all kinds of rules and made all kinds of threats, I gave them links to the mod offering "assistance," and absolutely nothing has been done. We had to take our sub private because they were brigading it. They're still making threats to the top mod who has yet to block them. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if these people didn't show up here because they stalk my posts with alts, mass down vote me, and comment with more crazy stuff. Still, admins have done absolutely nothing.

So, with all of that being said, it really baffles me that you said you have gotten people in trouble with admins for death wishes, but I can get stalked by a person for two weeks who is evading bans, evading blocks, a person who has made and is making threats, who is guilty of brigading and all kinds of Reddit TOS and Moddiquette and Reddiquette infractions, and absolutely nothing has been done to this person, or this group of people.</div>

I love history. In all my years of studying history, I can't find any examples of people who were on the right side of history that wished death on people and their families, who used coercion and physical violence to push their agendas. In fact, the opposite is true. History is littered with many failed authoritarian regimes that were animated by masses of hate filled useful idiots who dehumanized their ideological enemies by parroting State propaganda that labeled their enemies unclean vermin, painted them as a threat to the State, and tried to round up and exterminate those threats.</div>

I've been saying this about these "progressives" for years. They use rhetoric to get people desperate to believe someone cares to give them money and power, and then they continue to use rhetoric to distract those people while pointing the finger at the other team crying "Racist! Nazi!" in the hope no-one notices. They are so successful with this that they've managed to convince at least half the United States that anyone who points out how fraudulent they are is a racist Nazi. The Blue Team, Red Team binary way of thinking is a way to control the herd and keep them fighting and distracted so they never notice both sides are fucking them.</div>

AOC attended a $30K a ticket event at the MET with a dress that read "Tax the Rich" and when people came down hard on her the sub was locked to prevent further commenting and most of the comments critical of her were removed. Pretty hilarious stuff. Even more interesting than the fact AOC didn't donate her $30K ticket she was "gifted" and use the money to help the poor is that AOC and none of the celebrities are wearing masks, I'm guessing because masks clash with their hundred thousand dollar clothes, while the wait staff and journalists, the help, are wearing masks. Rules for thee, not for me, huh? I wonder, did they have a sign like at a theme park roller coaster with a furry mascot cutout holding a hand over a stack of money with a word balloon that says, "If you have THIS MUCH money you can not wear a mask!"

I wonder, will AOC be required to pay taxes on that $30K gift she was given? And I wonder how much that dress cost to make? Imagine how many soup kitchens could have been financed with that money. Imagine how much she could've helped her abuela with that money.

I just find it amazing that people are still at this point hoisting this person up as a hero, and when they lose the narrative because people point out the utter hypocrisy of a person like AOC who lives in a luxury apartment complex, who went from a poor bartender to a wealthy politician over night, attending an event filled with celebrities, dressing like she is a celebrity, not wearing a mask despite forcing others to wear masks, they lock the post. They lock the post, shut down conversation, remove comments, not because the subscribers to that sub are upset by her hypocrisy, but because the post became "popular" and "some people are very upset" and voiced their opinion that AOC is a grifter, and then provided evidence to support the claim.</div>

&gt;Libs are dumb for not eating horse medicine

Ivermectin has two forms, one for humans and one for animals. Ivermectin is FDA approved for the treatment of parasites in humans, is on the WHO list of essential medicines, the creators won the Noble Prize, and it has been prescribed for years to not just treat parasites, but also to treat viruses in humans, including Zika and influenza. Like many drugs that are developed for one use, scientists and doctors later discover another use for that same drug. This is why Ivermectin has been called a "wonder drug." It is also being used right now by doctors all around the world to treat Covid in human patients and is going through clinical trials to prove its effectiveness. Suggesting that Ivermectin is "horse medicine" and doesn't work on humans to treat viruses is misinformation. I can understand the confusion on the part of people who get their information from /r/politics, Vice News, Rolling Stone, and their Facebook feed, though. 

&gt;Ivermectin proposes many potentials effects to treat a range of diseases, with its antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-cancer properties as a wonder drug. It is highly effective against many microorganisms including some viruses. In this comprehensive systematic review, antiviral effects of ivermectin are summarized including in vitro and in vivo studies over the past 50 years. Several studies reported antiviral effects of ivermectin on RNA viruses such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Furthermore, there are some studies showing antiviral effects of ivermectin against DNA viruses such as Equine herpes type 1, BK polyomavirus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus 2, and bovine herpesvirus 1. Ivermectin plays a role in several biological mechanisms, therefore it could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19 as well as other types of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. In vivo studies of animal models revealed a broad range of antiviral effects of ivermectin, however, clinical trials are necessary to appraise the potential efficacy of ivermectin in clinical setting.

More proof that what they mean when they say "Follow the science" is just "Listen to the State and do what the TV says."

As always, people should consult their doctors before taking any medication or receiving any kind of treatment, and they definitely should not take anything formulated for animals or do something just because the TV and the government told them to.</div>

&gt;"Rogan is a sociopath. He doesn’t care about the damage he does as long as he keeps getting paid."

&gt;By taking a medicine that has been prescribed to humans by doctors for years to treat viruses and is currently being used by doctors all around the world to treat viruses, including Covid? Interesting take you have. Surely not biased at all or driven by politics. 🤭

&gt;"Why do people hate Joe? He seems fairly middle of the road and open to listening and talking about both sides. I guess I'm not getting why people are hating on him."

&gt;He did something the TV and the Vice News and Rolling Stone articles on Facebook told those people who hate him not to do. The TV and the Vice News and Rolling Stone articles on Facebook did not give these people context that Ivermectin has been used for years to treat influenza and Zika, among other viruses, that doctors around the world are currently using the human form to treat Covid, and so they are foaming a the mouth and gnashing their teeth. Now they're flailing about because Joe Rogan is testing negative for Covid and is perfectly fine. It's tribalism and impotent rage from people whose attention can be diverted from one thing to the next as easily as flipping a light switch.

As always, people should consult their doctors before taking any medication or receiving any kind of treatment, and they definitely should not take anything formulated for animals or do something just because the TV and the government told them to.</div>

&gt;First off, you're assuming that the person you are talking to does not believe Covid exists. Second, you are assuming the person doesn't care about people dying from Covid. Third, whether they do or do not believe in Covid has nothing to do with the debate over abortion.

&gt;In a debate there is what is called a THESIS, or a PROPOSITION, and then an ANTITHESIS, or what is called a COUNTER PROPOSITION, and from the conflict between those two ideas we arrive at a SYNTHESIS, something that is closer to the truth. Your comments were fallacious, you can not arrive at any synthesis because what you said was sophistry and it appealed to emotion. The issue being discussed, for some reason on a technology subreddit, is abortion and whether or not it is morally acceptable to terminate a pregnancy. Notice I say *morally*. We're not discussing religion. We're discussing this from the perspective of morality.

&gt;What is morality? What is right, what is wrong? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells" that would develop into a human? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells" that would develop into a human if there are health complications for the mother? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells" that would develop into a human if the mother was raped? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells"  that would develop into a human if it's just an inconvenience to the prospective mother? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells"  that would develop into a human if there is a *heart beat*? Does a *heart beat* qualify something as being alive? If so, does a "clump of cells" cease to be a "clump of cells" and does it become alive? If so, is it *moral* to terminate a *life* period?

&gt;The US Constitution prevents the government from violating our right to *Life*, Liberty, and Property. The entire purpose of the US Constitution is to restrain the government from violating what are called *unalienable* rights, rights that we are endowed with by nature and/or our creator. They are *self-evident*. If a woman has within her a living being with a heart beat, is it *moral* to terminate that life under any circumstances at all? These are questions I'm sure we won't solve by engaging in fallacy filled discussions full of sophistry and appeals to emotion.

&gt;*If* a person wants to get vaccinated for Covid and consults with their doctor and the *doctor* tells them to, they definitely should get the vaccine. However, Covid is effectively becoming [endemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/dr-scott-gottlieb-expects-coronavirus-to-be-an-endemic-virus-in-us-after-delta-surge.html) to the population and current [studies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/previous-covid-prevents-delta-infection-better-than-pfizer-shot?sref=i4qXzk6d&amp;fbclid=IwAR3oOyXtiEG3pklD6x3OqNr6-VaxMV-Yv8C0Pz5-dTarMBpXQBN4fla2CIs) are suggesting that perhaps getting Covid is more effective than the immunity offered by the vaccines. There is [research](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58270098) that suggests seeking to arrive at 0% Covid is not realistic and is unattainable.

&gt;If a vaccinated person is worried about their health, they are free to wear a mask and take whatever measures they need to to feel safe, but is it right to force someone whose doctor told them they can't get vaccinated, or perhaps doesn't want to get vaccinated because they would rather deal with the virus when they get it and perhaps get better immunity to the virus in the future than a vaccine will offer, to get vaccinated just to make you feel better? Because, again, according to [studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/08/06/fully-vaccinated-may-transmit-delta-just-as-easily-and-new-variant-shows-signs-of-vaccine-evasion-early-uk-research-suggests/?sh=196668d81ac5) fully vaccinated people are getting and spreading Covid just as easily as an unvaccinated person. So, is it *moral* to force a person to get a medical treatment they may not be able to get, they may not want, and may not even need, just to make *you* feel better?

&gt;I guess downvotes will make the facts go away. Apparently the BBC, Bloomberg, CNBC, Forbes, and the scientists they quote are less informed than the people on /r/technology. "Listen to the experts," except for when they start disagreeing with the experts people have been listening to.

What's funny is they say that saying fully vaccinated people are getting and spreading Covid just as easily as an unvaccinated person "is misinformation, and at best a misinterpretation of the source material." And yet [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/evidence-mounts-that-people-with-breakthrough-infections-can-spread-delta-easily) is an article from National Geographic literally titled "Evidence mounts that people with breakthrough infections can spread Delta easily: **A new study finds that this dominant variant can grow in the noses of vaccinated people as strongly as in unvaccinated people**." And [here](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/vaccinated-people-spreading-delta-variant-just-as-quickly-as-the-unvaccinated-leaked-cdc-document/wcm/44cb4c25-91f6-4af1-86a2-533d0ef2d326/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) is an article from the National Post titled "Vaccinated people spreading Delta variant just as quickly as the unvaccinated: Leaked CDC document." And [here](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ultra-vaccinated-israels-debacle-is-a-dire-warning-to-america) is an article from The Daily Beast titled "Ultra-Vaxxed Israel’s Crisis Is a Dire Warning to America" that quotes an Israeli doctor who talks about how Delta spreads just as quickly among the fully vaccinated as it does among the unvaccinated.

As always, people should consult their doctors before taking any medication or receiving any kind of treatment, and they definitely should not take anything formulated for animals or do something just because the TV and the government told them to.</div>

[–]Spider__Jerusalem -10 points 1 day ago 

    If you're unvaccinated right now, delta is currently hunting you down and if exposed you're pretty much guaranteed to become a virus factory (not to mention rolling the dice with Covid yourself.)

"That's why so many fully vaccinated people are getting and spreading Covid, because unvaccinated people are giving them Covid, those darn virus factories. Ignore all the reports about fully vaccinated people still being able to get and spread Covid just as easily as unvaccinated people though. If they would just get vaccinated we could go back to normal! But make sure to keep wearing your mask because you can still get and spread Covid! A mask is effective, but make sure to wear at least two!"</div>
