Bro come on. Be fucking realistic here. 

&gt;most people find hot girls intimidating 

Its more like they admit to themselves they dont have a chance. Even then there are plenty of guys that shoot their shot but still fail and its not due to a lack of confidence its due to a lack of looks. Its not like i havent done this either, when i learned pua i approached all types of women, fat and ugly to victorias secret models. I shot the shit with random dudes too cause hey, gotta get out of that shell, gotta learn to be social. Guys were chill, smoke a cig and talk a lot of shit about music, events, hidden gems, etc. Girls however were much more guarded and the blackpill explained to me why i failed so much. Trash genes dont get passed on in a world without enforced monogamy, see any animal that operates this way for proof. When women pick they go after the best. When monogamy is the social norm the best have to pick one and remove themselves from the dating pool, constantly shifting the available best down as similar quality men and women shack up. Feminism and free sex will collapse society, were already seeing the mass exodus of men from society in general because why bother if you're not guaranteed a mate?

&gt;use visualization, cognitive behavioral therapy

Just astral project onto another realm of existence and get a universe gf bro.</div>

Ive approached even groups of women. Its always the same response from them: aloof disinterest, gotta suddenly check that phone and avoid returning eye contact, guarded body language, im busy, i have a boyfriend, im a lesbian, theres ALWAYS some excuse. Its not like i go after hot women either, i go after average looking girls mostly since at least theyre closer to my league than a near model girl is. Same shit. Women just dont want short and ugly guys.

&gt;what kind of inner game work did you do?

I havent kept up with pua in ages, what do you mean by inner game?</div>

If i had never done any of that and became an unironic basement dweller there would be absolutely no difference between the two lifestyles. 

All the skills i developed and all the experience i have that makes me an interesting person isnt enough. I could be the most interesting book you ever read but since the cover sucks most people arent going to ever crack it open. You can say "just keep trying bro" but after all this effort how many more times must i do the exact same thing while expecting a different outcome? How much longer do i willingly engage in the definition of insanity before admitting that its fucking over?</div>

The worst part is that IT is still up and running despite them literally driving people to suicide. Take a look at this users history and tell me whether or not he was bullied into killing himself u/uggocel. His farewell post is gone now that braincels was nuked but his posts on IT remain. His rope post specifically mentioned how his interaction with IT drove him to suicide as a result of the harassment he got.</div>
