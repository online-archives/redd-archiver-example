    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Ya, I thought my case was bad. But then I read what she was writing to other people and it's 10x worse. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with vaccinated people continuing to wear masks around unvaccinated people. Even the CDC says there is nothing wrong with it. The vaccines are not 100% effective and some people don't want a mild or moderate case of covid when it can be avoided; it's not even know if a mild case can result in long covid or other longer term issues. There could also be variants in the future that the vaccines are less effective against. 

There is so much unknown still about the virus, variants, and vaccines. We are learning as we go. There is 0 issue with people being cautious and it has NOTHING to do with health anxiety. In fact, I have read of **many** extremely smart, competent doctors doing this. I was just listening to a podcast with 2 ER doctors from NYU and they still wear masks in indoor public spaces, avoid restaurants, etc. and they are vaccinated. I can provide many many examples of people doing this, including infectious disease experts. It's a matter of choice. 

This mod is wrong and contradicts what the CDC says herself. It's all about her personal opinion and beliefs and doing what she can to spread that, while shutting down anyone that says anything different.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Thanks for your comment.

This moderator is nuts. She won't leave me alone and will not stop harassing me and posting in this thread, even when asked to stop. She ironically bans people left and right but then thinks she has all the rights in the world to say whatever she wants wherever she wants.

She is also lying and trying to spin all of this in her favor, saying whatever she can to "defend" her banning me and others. Now she is trying to make this about policing what she thinks is too "anxiety provoking" for people to post in the other subgroup when in fact all of this is based on her own biases and narrative and what she personally agrees or disagrees with. 

Not only that, but telling me that she hopes I can learn a lesson from someone standing up to me. SMH. This woman is nuts and the more she talks, the more I'm convinced of it. She is also condescending and rude. Someone like her should be the last one to moderate any type of "support group".

Anyway, thanks for the support and for taking the time to stand up to this moderator.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My comments were NOT inappropriate in any way. My initial comment received 4 upvotes. This had nothing to with that.

You have biases that are obvious from your comment history that you are very much AGAINST sanitizing surfaces. You go so far as to tell people that its basically stupid to disinfect things. That is your narrative. And if anyone challenges that, you censor them. 

90%+ of everything in that subgroup and on reddit is anecdotes and people discuss all kinds of things in that subreddit. Nobody had any issue with what I wrote. And as someone that has anxiety MYSELF, I can tell you there is not only absolutely NOTHING wrong with discussing things, it's normal and HELPFUL to people. You don't put people with anxiety in a bubble and block out the world. What if someone with anxiety posted about how they were anxious about x, y, and z and you didn't like it or claimed it made people more anxious? Like come on lady!! You are just being the reddit police. 

That particular post was also just a link to an article, not someone complaining about being anxious. 

And your own comment history proves that you don't actually care about anyone's "anxiety" or being supportive. You just have your own beliefs and its all about spreading them and censoring anyone that disagrees.

**Nobody is misrepresenting you. You proved YOURSELF with your responses that you are delusional. My initial post was about how your extreme censorship and policing was wrong. But you have gone out of your way to make things up, try to spin this in your favor, try to twist everything. And you won't stop. You do not know how to leave people alone. And everything is about YOUR "rights" to say what you want, but ironically you block people and ban them for saying what THEY want. Because its all about you.** 

I hope that YOU can reflect on your behavior, but I know in reality that you can't. Your behavior is so outrageous and you are so condescending that there may be no hope for you. 

And I don't care that I got banned by an obnoxious moderator. I just think that on a global scale, moderators like you are toxic and dangerous to society because you only allow people to hear what you want and censor everything you don't like.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Stop, just stop. Enough already. Your censorship and policing is obnoxious. My comment got 4 upvotes. I'm allowed to question surface transmission. People talk about all kinds of things in that Reddit group and question things all the time.

You just don't like the idea of surface transmission and you are biased. It's obvious. I read through your other comments. You just get rid of things you don't like.

Stop policing people and leave them alone. 

Heck, I probably have more freedom to say what I want in an actual therapy group. But on reddit you police the heck out of everything.
And you act like oh this is a support group, I'm just trying to protect people. Ha! That's hilarious. I've seen your responses to other people. You are far from supportive. And most of the comments are all over the place in terms of support.

Even so, to delete and ban people for posting respectful comments and questioning absolutely normal things is...crazy. People can discuss things in a support group. It's normal. Nobody flagged my comments and nobody responded saying anything negative 

You even told me that you were removing my comments because they were not "accurate" and now are trying to spin this differently.

Bottom line: your extreme censorship is wrong. You are doing what you can to push your narrative and therefore you are keeping posts you like and deleting what you don't like. This is all about you and your biases. You love to ban people left and right, it's clearly your hobby.

And the fact that you keep trying to get the last word and trying to defend yourself... it just shows you are desperate</div>

 "No, and you never needed to be doing this in the first place. It was never recommended by anyone."

Except, they have.

[https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleid=27245&amp;publicId=395](https://hartfordhealthcare.org/about-us/news-press/news-detail?articleid=27245&amp;publicId=395)

And I can give you more examples.

So when are you going to ban yourself from the group for stating something completely false?

And another guy on the thread said he worked in a grocery store and didn't wipe anything down as required because he didn't see the need to do that. And his comment is still up, even though he was describing a disregard for public health laws and protocols.

All of this points to you and your biases. You don't want anyone to mention covid spreading through surfaces. You don't want anyone wiping things down. You allow anecdotes when they support your narrative. And you want your point of view to shine through.</div>

And no you don't have the right to go around following people online in order to defend yourself. There is no record to set straight - I told it like it is. You don't like that someone is complaining about you, and now you are trying to make yourself look good.

a) 90% of the comments and posts on /r/covid19_support are anecdotes

b) The comment with my anecdote got 4 upvotes, so everyone was cool with it and many people even liked it and agreed with it

c) I had another comment that you also deleted that did not have any anecdotes, just my questioning the CDC on transmission through surfaces. You deleted that one right away too. 

d) The reason you deleted my comments:  "Your post has been removed as your information does not link to a reliable source and therefore may not be accurate"

e) This is no reason to ban anyone

You spend way too much of your time scrolling through and reading everyone's comments and deleting the ones that you don't like. 

And no you don't have the "right" to do anything any more than I have a "right" to post in /r/covid19_support. Hopefully the moderator of this group can ban you.</div>

Please, go ahead with the above. Would love to witness it in action and see proof that you are going about your day without doing any of these things and rubbing your eyes and mouth.

I am not an idiot and I know that you have to touch your eyes or mouth or nose after touching a contaminated surface. 

The entirety of the article assumes that you won't touch your face without washing your hands!!! 

And yes the **CDC says they don't believe its the main way that it spreads. So what? They never said that it doesn't spread that way.** And the CDC doesn't know about where the thousands and thousands of asymptomatic infections came from either. They are basing this off of what they know, not what they don't know.

Every doctor I talked to after my positive test result told me that it was possible I got infected from a surface. You need to stop harassing people. We still don't know everything about this virus, and experts say that it is in fact possible to get it from a surface, just like with other respiratory infections. 

You are wrong that surface transmission is impossible. Admit that you are wrong, and move on.</div>

When I was in grad school we debated all the time about different topics in and out of class. It was considered to be completely normal. We were even encouraged to discuss limitations of research articles.

This cancel culture on reddit (and in today's society) is really obnoxious. 

The moderator told me to go "rant" in some other reddit group about my experience, so I did. Then she follows me here, leaves a comment trying to control the narrative HERE too. And then proceeds to tell me that I need therapy (see her comments below). Really unbelievable</div>

You are gaslighting me and making it seem as if there is something wrong with me, when I actually have a right to be frustrated.

Any normal person would be upset about getting banned from a community by a controlling moderator who was banning people left and right to ensure that the comments fit with their narrative. I didn't post anything offensive or even factually incorrect. You just didn't like what I said due to your own biases, and deleted my comments.

Then when I go to a different group and discuss what happened, you follow me and try to control the narrative here too!!

And now you are telling me that I need to see a therapist?? What?? I have every right to be annoyed.

Can you just leave me alone? It is incredibly sick to go around telling people to go seek therapy when you don't even know them.</div>

"Yes, the virus lives on surfaces – door handles, countertops, clothing, furniture and much more. How long the virus survives on a given surface varies from hours to days, depending on numerous factors.  
Yes, you can become infected with the virus after touching a contaminated surface."

The reason that it is noted that this method of transmission is low is due to **frequent hand washing**, so experts are saying it is unlikely to be transmitted this way because people are sanitizing and hand washing, not because it isn't possible. 

So when we all go back to normal and people stop sanitizing and stop washing and stop wearing masks, the incidences of surface transmission may increase. 

But anyway, experts agree that it is possible to get covid from a surface.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are proving through this comment that you are nothing more than controlling reddit police. I don't care who you are in real life, but your life revolves around censoring people and banning them if you don't like what they say. This level of censorship is **wrong.** You spend your time policing people to ensure that everything fits your own narrative. I actually think that is dangerous.

Someone posted a link in the covid support group about covid on surfaces, and I responded to it. The original post wasn't about someone talking about their fears or concerns. It was literally just an article. And some of the responses to it were from people that said they were cutting corners at work and not sanitizing their grocery store or that thy will stop sanitizing and cleaning, even if it is required by their place of work. And you had no problems with those comments. Just MY comment, which was respectful and suggested something different - AND got 4 upvotes.

Every article that I have read says that it **absolutely is possible to catch covid from a surface; maybe less likely, but possible.** My own doctor and contact tracer told me that it was possible that I caught covid from a surface. And then I get banned by some moderator on Reddit for stating an "anecdote" that you didn't like. Most of what people post are "anecdotes" - so maybe just ban....everyone?

Also, my thought that what if asymptomatically or mildly infected people may have been infected from a surface (received a viral load) isn't some crazy conspiracy theory; it's plausible. Just has not been studied. But oooh how DARE I mention a hypothesis!

You must have been banning people who, early last year, suggested that masks could be beneficial. The CDC has flip flopped on **nearly everything** so it was actually the people that questioned them that turned out to be correct. And there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with bringing up opinions that may or may not fully align with what has been published about a still **relatively new** virus where were are still **learning about it.**

You also responded to someone's comment saying that **"nobody, ever"** told anyone to disinfect their keys or phone or personal items. WRONG. We were told to do that for months and months by top experts. What you said is your *personal opinion*, not facts. So you should ban yourself from the community. You are highly highly biased so your claim that you are some neutral party in this is absolutely wrong. You, from the beginning, have been against sanitizing surfaces and taking certain precautions.

Fine - go live in your echo chamber where you get to dictate every thing that is said and to control everything. You are contributing nothing positive to our society. This is not normal or healthy.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I only brought up the notion that it could be transmitted via surface more often than we know because it's really hard to track down surface transmission, and those cases might expose people to lower viral loads leading to mild illness.
I also noted that I tested positive for covid while living alone and having no exposure to people and when I talked to the contact tracer and my doctor they said I could have gotten it from a surface potentially and was told that a lot of people don't know how they got it, so it's not like every case is due to known exposure.

I could be wrong, but I don't think my comments should be removed nor that I should be banned. There was no reason to delete my comments when someone could have just responded and disagreed with what I said.

People are so obsessed with spreading "misinformation" that they start censoring anyone that dare question anything.

You are right that there were so many arguments made around covid that people were called conspiracy theorists for, but they turned out to be right.</div>
