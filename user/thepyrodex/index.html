This isn't new and sadly your just seeing it, remember when those crazy people said "if they can ban this they will ban you one day" well it's happening all over.

I remember the old days of reddit, back in the "before" when it was actually free, even for people that disagreed.  I miss those days and it's why I keep coming back hoping to find it but it's worse every time.</div>

No background checks aren't disarming people, making common use firearms illegal is.

I pass my background checks, I have multiple firearms, the left is actively trying to make my AR, that I use for competition CMP shooting, illegal nationally.

Go read the campaign site for Joe Biden, it's in his damn 100 day plan...

How about you stop trying to make a straw man out of background checks and deal with the actual fact that the current President has actually said he will ban a firearm that exists in the millions in the country.

That is disarming the people.

Imagine believing that only bad people are being censored or that it isn't happening.

That those jokes about hive mind and "useful idiots" are just anger from the right.

Untill one day, it's you being banned for not toeing "the new party" lines/talking points or asking the wrong question.

Wouldn't that make you wonder if the people who were also banned aren't what you told they were?

If you thought that only bad people with wrong opinions get banned, yet you yourself got banned but know you're not a hateful person, not a bigot or any "ist", couldn't that of happen to all the other people also banned?

Remember, the left and right aren't that far separated until you hit the extremes, it's not hard to see how someone in the middle would change sides once they've experienced the exact thing the "right" side warned them about the left.</div>

There's a reason 43 million background checks for guns were performed in 2020.

People are waking up to the lies they have been fed by the oligarchy that have been in power since the Vietnam war.

But not enough and the media is owned and controlled, so things like cheating and impeachment of a non sitting president are considered okay.

It's terrifying when you realize they also want to disarm innocent people.  There is no reason to disarm law abiding people unless you are worried they might stand up for themselves with it.

Why would they care if a law abiding person owns a gun and follows the laws?  

The next step is always removal of any "unallowables" which isn't a far step from "deplorables".

Also read *rules for radicals.*.</div>

The power of the Executive Branch is vested in the President of the United States, who also acts as head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President is responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress and, to that end, appoints the heads of the federal agencies, including the Cabinet. The Vice President is also part of the Executive Branch, ready to assume the Presidency should the need arise.

The Cabinet and independent federal agencies are responsible for the day-to-day enforcement and administration of federal laws. These departments and agencies have missions and responsibilities as widely divergent as those of the Department of Defense and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Including members of the armed forces, the Executive Branch employs more than 4 million Americans.

The President

The President is both the head of state and head of government of the United States of America, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.
Under Article II of the Constitution, the President is responsible for the execution and enforcement of the laws created by Congress. Fifteen executive departments — each led by an appointed member of the President’s Cabinet — carry out the day-to-day administration of the federal government. They are joined in this by other executive agencies such as the CIA and Environmental Protection Agency, the heads of which are not part of the Cabinet, but who are under the full authority of the President. The President also appoints the heads of more than 50 independent federal commissions, such as the Federal Reserve Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as federal judges, ambassadors, and other federal offices. The Executive Office of the President (EOP) consists of the immediate staff to the President, along with entities such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.

The President has the power either to sign legislation into law or to veto bills enacted by Congress, although Congress may override a veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses. The Executive Branch conducts diplomacy with other nations, and the President has the power to negotiate and sign treaties, which also must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate. The President can issue executive orders, which direct executive officers or clarify and further existing laws. The President also has unlimited power to extend pardons and clemencies for federal crimes, except in cases of impeachment.

With these powers come several responsibilities, among them a constitutional requirement to “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” Although the President may fulfill this requirement in any way he or she chooses, Presidents have traditionally given a State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress each January (except in inaugural years) outlining their agenda for the coming year

She wouldn't be third party if other supported her ideas...

&gt;I don't know where you think my perception is, but it's less flawed then your logical arguments.

You have not given one example of how anything she said would be achievable.

You claim my logic is flawed?

All you've done is say "I agree with her" and parroted her illogical talking points.

I've told you why her pipe dreams are unachievable from the office she is running for and your response has been "but we can just change it".</div>

&gt;&gt;She wants to put a put tests in place to determine if you should be allowed to vote (found unconstitutional already)
&gt;
&gt;I am against this and haven't seen it mentioned on her literature. 

&gt;&gt;She wants to allow social media to go unregulated.
&gt;
&gt;Good

So you're fine with large corporations controlling what can and can't be said on a *platform*?

You're fine with allowing limitations on free speech?

You do understand that a *platform* can't act as a *publisher* without crossing liability laws right?

&gt;&gt;She want to have requirements for vaccination of children in schools removed.
&gt;
&gt;Good. Especially since I'm one of those people who almost died reviving a vaccine. 

So because your parents weren't smart enough to get you a medical exemption we should allow everyone to refuse vaccination and allow antiquated diseases to resurface? 

Especially with her want to increase immigration how would you prevent the spread of those diseases without herd immunity?

&gt;&gt;She wants to shut down US funded space flight.
&gt;
&gt;Good. Elon Musk is doing a great job. Imagine if he had more competition. 

And so are the other *national and international* space agencies, how can spaceX compete with these space program when they don't have to turn a profit?  Not all science is profitable yet corporations must turn a profit.  How will that work?

&gt;&gt;She wants to remove many if the rules and regulations that prevents a corporate monopoly for existing.
&gt;
&gt;Great. These monopolies still exists in the form of hedge funds. They need to be transparent on who owns what. 

Do you understand what a hedge fund is?  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund

They are high risk investments not industry controlling monopolizing entities.

&gt;&gt;The only thing she makes sense on is gun....
&gt;
&gt;Not the only

No, that's the only one.

&gt;She wants to eliminate laws that create victimless crime. 

She can't do that, she isn't Congress.

&gt;She wants our troops returned home.

Yet she also states that military actions and decision are the territory of Congress and that anything else is unconstitutional...  Which is it?


She is a terrible candidate that is only appealing to people who have no understanding of what she could even do in office or how the electoral system works in this country.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;A president has the power to lead. Some of her ideas would take a constitutional convention. I think we need one for a host of reasons.

Leadership doesn't equal the power to call a constitutional convention and even than it requires a 2/3 vote from Congress to change it.

She doesn't have the power to make laws, she doesn't have the power to interpret laws.

She doesn't have the influence or power to make that vote happen, especially when she would be fighting BOTH parties that have power.

You have a very flawed perception of what a president can and cannot due in office.</div>

&gt;
&gt;Your logic is astounding. Here you advocate voting third party.

You are being purposefully dense.

The only place the third party stands a chance is in local elections.  If you can't see this I can understand why you believe in Jo.


&gt;Here in the same comment you suggest otherwise. 

For the president... 

&gt;I'm not taking a moral high ground. I'm voting for a candidate that meets has the most ideologies that align with mine. Frankly I see no difference between Biden or Trump ideologically. 

Then throw your vote away.

Your no better than a Bernie bro shilling for socialism.

&gt;&gt;If you don't want Biden in office, vote for Trump.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;I'd you don't want Trump in office, vote Biden.
&gt;
&gt;You know, if I don't want either there is another option. Jo Jorgensen.

Yep, a terrible choice and you won't get what you want, there's not a single chance Jo is going to win.

She's wants to *increase* immigration.

She wants to allow a temporary amnesty to illegals while saying she also wants them to be deported after serving a sentence from breaking the law...  You know like illegally immigrating isnt a crime....

She wants to increase work visas.

She wants to make the citizenship test *easier*.

She wants to remove pricing regulations on life saving drugs.

She wants to remove the government from providing mental healthcare and make it private when this country is in the middle of a massive mental health crisis.

**she wants to give foreigners the right to vote after 2 years living here**

She wants to remove political donation limits.

She wants to put a put tests in place to determine if you should be allowed to vote (found unconstitutional already)

She wants to allow social media to go unregulated.

She want to have requirements for vaccination of children in schools removed.

She wants to shut down US funded space flight.

She wants to remove many if the rules and regulations that prevents a corporate monopoly for existing.

The only thing she makes sense on is gun....</div>
