    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah - okay, buddy. Keeping telling yourself that you're an absolute genius for not falling for the left's tactic of turning conservatives into racist Nazi bigots so that they can more easily demonize us and defeat us. 

And I'm sure that all of the supposedly based black, Asian, and Hispanic conservatives out there will come to our aid and help us to defeat the left's cynical communist-idpol agenda. 

I've literally been hearing that shit for *decades* from insanely delusional conservatives. "This will *definitely* be the year that blacks will come out for us in droves!" Only for, like, 95% of blacks to continue to reliably vote Democrat...

And *even if* you somehow manage to convince PoCs to vote Republican, what exactly are you hoping to accomplish anyway? Protecting your precious gun rights? Lowering taxes, removing environmental regulations, and reducing the size of government? How can you still give a shit about those normie conservative issues as you're literally being racially dispossessed???</div>

I actually like the LGBTQIA+ tag since it makes it easier for me to avoid all of those degenerate freaks. Huzzah for bringing back the era of segregation! I just wish that you could exclude entire categories so that I never have to see any of these "oppressed minorities" *ever* again. 

Another reason why I like these ultra-woke tags is that they're probably unintentionally backfiring on their intended purpose by making White people more aware of their own identity while also alienating normal people and further eroding their trust in our liberal-infested cultural institutions. 

If our leftist overlords were smart, they'd just continue to pursue the strategy that they were utilizing throughout the 1960s to early 2000s by encouraging White people to be colorblind individualists so that the left could continue to advance their anti-White agenda without White people really being aware of what was going on. Instead, they've transitioned to constantly forcing White people to be hyper-aware of their own Whiteness and aggressively demanding that they act like groveling ethnomasochistic cucks and "allies" towards groups of people who openly despise them.

Imagine being a dreaded straight White male Zoomer that's currently trying to forge a path for himself through life by working hard in school so that he can hopefully secure a good job in the future and provide for himself and his family, only to get constantly reminded of how much our institutional elites absolutely despise him while also seeing all of these freaks and weirdos given all sorts of preferential treatment. What a perfect system for churning out militant Alt-Righters that want to completely destroy this entire system.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">To me it's mostly about the sheer performance and speed and the sense of exhilaration that comes with being completely exposed to the elements and other vehicles around you. And there's plenty of skill involved with riding motorcycles that doesn't involve shifting gears - e.g., body positioning, leaning through turns, and throttle control being the most obvious. And besides, both the industry and the market is clearly on my side on this one since almost all of the biggest manufacturers are moving towards quickshifters and automatics - e.g., the new Honda Rebel 1100 and Ducati Monster.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Relying on the loud noise of your exhaust in order to stay safe is extremely stupid imo. They'll still swerve into you. It's much, much better to simply maintain safe distancing and speed around other cars at all times - which will work regardless if your motorcycle is loud or not.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I honestly can't wait for electric motorcycles to become more mainstream. A lot of purists like being annoying by swapping out their exhausts to make them even louder while also looking down on riders that use quick shifters, but that's honestly my two least favorite things about riding my motorcycles. With electric motorcycles, not only will you avoid giving everyone around you permanent hearing damage, but you'll also be able to focus much more on what's going on around you without having to constantly mess with a clutch and gear shifter.</div>
