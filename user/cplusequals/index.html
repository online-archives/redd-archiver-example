    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Sorry, I've only been keeping track of places like Texas, Florida, Missouri, you know, the hotspots? They're not full. Never have been. Florida hospital CEOs had to come out and say they were "busy but able" at the height of this most recent surge. I mean, to my knowledge electives are on literally everywhere and hospitalizations are roughly half of what they were this last winter. They didn't get overfilled then how on earth are they going to now with half the population already vaccinated?

So if you are being both truthful and correct about your grandma's case, it's a very isolated situation and not a national pattern. I suspect that isn't the case and you're mistaken. Especially since COVID patients are explicitly segregated from other patients.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I agree. But backing it up with "that's what science shows" is braindead and demonstrates your inability to show how that conclusion is reached. You're also still ignoring the fact that you believe NNN is a conspiracy subreddit and that there's some sort of imperative to get people vaccinated. You don't understand the issue at all. You simply agree with me that for most people vaccination is preferable.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No, we most certainly didn't. NNN is overwhelmingly populated by people that simply don't trust the side-effects or dislike being coerced. You seem to paint them as conspiracy theorists. Those people make up a pretty small amount of the population. Additionally, you say "we all need to get vaccinated" which is not true. There's no reason to get vaccinated if you don't believe COVID is a danger to you. There's no benefit for anyone else except the vaccinated individual and whoever pays their medical bills.

Unless you mistyped in your first post which is possible.

&gt; That's what the science shows.

This is still a meme of a sentence.</div>

You catching it doesn't matter. The only people at risk right right now are those that don't want to get vaccinated. THAT is what "the science and evidence" shows.

I swear it's a fucking meme how many people say "trust the science" and then completely fuck up the conclusion they're supposed to draw from the data.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This isn't the post I saw, but the content is mostly the same minus all the other speakers that were supposed to be there (but dropped out). I guess with only 3.8k upvotes it's not surprising it was missed (most at the time were 10-15k).

I'll concede that this was posted (thanks for providing it, by the way), but it seems to refute your claim considering it directly voices opposition to the speakers' views and the most charitable thing I says about them is "don't punch right." which is an outgrowth of the left motto "don't punch left".

I'll restate, if you claim the posters at T_D are Nazis you are hurting our social fabric. This is no different than me claiming everyone on Sanders4Pres was a communist which is clearly not the case. You still haven't explained why their favorite commenters seems to magically be every thing the alt-right hates. Your argument has no legs to stand on now that we can see the post is clearly not an embrace of Nazi values.

Perhaps you should consider improving your trait openness. It will help your view of the world be less hostile when you're more charitable. Especially when you're supposed to be on the same side. We all want to make America better.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Saying "Richard Spencer will be there" is entirely different than saying "hey, it's a Nazi rally". CPAC hosted Le Pen who was a stones throw from Spencer and only a mini-Stalin would call that a Nazi rally. Obviously you shouldn't listen to mini-Stalins. There were dozens of posts stating traditional conservative speakers were invited and would be attending including the one you're probably referring to (link please, by the way). By the time the rally happened nearly all of them had distanced themselves and didn't show up. Why would T_D condemn them if they wanted to support Nazis? The actual Nazis don't. Why are their two most popular political commentators a gay man engaged to a black man and an orthodox Jew? Your claim makes no sense.

Please don't give purposefully misleading accounts of your political opponents. It's causing the degradation of our society and it's honestly not persuasive to centrists.</div>

They also stickied a message condemning the alt-right immediately following that.

If you aren't willing to give your political opponents the same charity you'd give yourself you're just another bad actor polarizing the political field. And you very well might be being charitable. I don't know. Just make sure you don't end up at a rally with antifa in it because I can guarantee you you'll be lumped in with those post-modernist mini-Stalins and you'll deserve it.</div>
