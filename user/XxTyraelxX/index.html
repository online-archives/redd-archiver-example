I'm not surprised that posting something anti-conservative got you banned - I'm banned from r/Socialism for trying to argue against socialism.

I'm also banned from r/Democrats for arguing against democrats.

If you want to argue with r/Conservative, join our discord - very few of us are active on reddit anymore, but there are plenty of leftists/democrats on our discord.

You will absolutely learn something talking to us - namely that most of us are pretty damn reasonable.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Ugh yeah - they were the first sub to ever ban me on reddit when I was new.

Every post had incredibly sexist overtones and anyone who pointed it out got the boot.

I'm glad that people like you exist though - it makes me feel a lot better about that type of thing.

It bothers me that this type of thing has become so prevalent - just tonight I was talking to my daughter (teenager) who told me that men should stay out of any discussion about abortion because it's a "woman's issue." I asked her how she'd feel if I told her to stay out of conversations because it was "men talking - we don't need a woman's opinion." I think she saw the sexism pretty quickly - and of course I went on to explain that it takes two people to make a baby - a man and a woman. There is some wild science coming out iirc that lets women conceive with one another - and of course I asked if trans men were allowed in the conversation since they can get pregnant too - and it became clear that she hadn't ever really thought about these things which is why discussions and reasoned dissent are so important.

Finally I ended with the fact that we're all human beings capable of empathising and discussing issues with one another regardless of our genetic attributes.

That's the lesson that should be taught in my opinion.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well I apologize for judging you so harshly but as you can see I'm here a lot for being censored lol.

Usually I try to avoid calling people names, but most recently I alerted someone to their deleted comment - they replied to me calling me a "loon" which was a single word at the end of their otherwise reasonable point.

They took my advice and removed the word and we ended up having a good conversation - one that never would've happened because he called me a name that doesn't bother me at all.

I'm on mobile or I'd link his censored comment - you can ceddit it here:

https://snew.notabug.io/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/hbp5wx/truth/fvbguwx/

It's worth noting that the rest of his comment was him saying he wouldn't vote for Biden - removed because of the word "loon" - see how it gets shady?</div>

Do we really want to raise a populace so sheltered that they can't even handle being called a name long enough to block someone on their own?

Everybody has the power to click "block" - they don't need you to do it for them.

If someone threatens violence or does something illegal, *then* you can remove their comment and report them.

In some subreddits, modding may also make sure that conversations stay on-topic.

Like if I run a sub about trains and someone comes on to rant about religion or politics, that would be an example of something that could be removed, BUT - you must be very careful to remove *every single instance of this uniformly* - and that never seems to happen. 

Best to play it safe as possible before you silence another human being by force.</div>

And note that nobody, anywhere is even talking about justified vs unjustified killings.

Imagine 100% of crime was committed by whites, all shootings were justified, and you were sitting here arguing that the system was clearly racist.

Would it be? And if your answer is still yes then it's "always racist" which is vacuous.</div>

&gt;Remember when you guys said "*if a single nazi is in your protest, then you're all white supremacists*"?

&gt;Pepperidge farm remembers.

&gt;Edit: [Here - so I'm not accused of making shit up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/ertxgu/gun_rights_rally_virginiarally/ff6lqtv/?context=8&amp;depth=9)

&gt;And [more examples.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/erd289/this_is_your_annual_reminder_that_if_mlk_was/ff4cj99?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

This is the kind of shit I'm talking about when they try to argue I'm defending nazis.

They're so disingenuous and downright vacuous with this bullshit.

As Trump said (which has been subsequently ignored):

&gt;[W]e condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.

&gt;And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.

&gt;Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.

&gt;We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.

When you have to troll someone's comment history in an effort to discredit them, you're probably an idiot.

When you find a sub where they gather to point out political censorship and attack them there to advocate censorship - how shitty are you?

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;if that is the case then the solution would be for the police to pull out of the area briefly so the rioters can calm down.

I kinda lost it at this line dude - [that's what they did in Minneapolis and it's part of the reason the city literally burned.](https://www.newsweek.com/minneapolis-police-flee-protesters-1507266)

&gt;But if the riots started with no provocation then there should be consequences for those who started it 

What kind of consequences? How do you capture someone wearing a mask in a riot unless you get them then and there?

Maybe you could taze them, use pepper spray, hit them with some sort of blunt object so that you can subdue them? Uh oh, here we are with "brutality" again.

Have you seen any of the videos of rioters beating innocent people in the streets? If you haven't, let me know and I'll send you some videos - they're getting harder and harder to find as they're being covered up. Suffice it to say, more than one black police officer has been attacked and killed trying to prevent looters from looting.

&gt;if they are taught more about how to respond to someone and not to shoot on impulse then that will cause an increase in police related deaths

I agree, but floyd wasn't shot. Also, watch a few videos of police getting killed during routine stops and you'll realize how dangerous it is to simply pull someone over in America.

The one that really got me is now used as a training video for a police force - the officer asked the men to open the trunk which was filled to the brim with bricks of marijuana - the 3 people pulled over beat him to death right there and left him to die on the side of the road - it was caught on dashcam.

People need to remember why we respect the police - and also, as you said, we should defend ourselves when we can (hence the second amendment being so important). It's actually for the second amendment that I generally lean right - democrats desperately want to disarm you and then - what? Disband the police force? 

Anarchy.</div>

None of us want police officers murdering people - that's why they've been charged and they're likely going to jail.

The other thing is that the movement itself has been hijacked by people who just want to tear the system down, who are opportunistically stealing for their own benefit, etc.

And finally, we need the police - a whole squad resigned recently - can you imagine if nobody wanted to be a police officer? If you called for help and no one came? There has to be a balance.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You seem to have an open enough mind and you're willing to listen so some facts, so here you go:

Democratic policy incentivized single parent households in black communities. More welfare was given out to single mothers than families that had a father in the home. The result of this is that it became profitable to be a single mother - which, unfortunately, meant that kids were being raised without a father.

Kids being raised without a father do far worse at many, many things - in particular:

&gt;Studies have found that children raised without a father are: At a higher risk of having behavioral problems. Four times more likely to live in poverty. More likely to be incarcerated in their lifetime.

So you may see where this disproportionate amount of black crime comes from - and I can tell you right now, democratic policy didn't help them.

There's some data here if you'd like to read further:

Which of course is a bunch of people screaming "Not all protesters are rioters!" - obviously the same thing as saying "Not all police officers are racist and evil," but somehow these facts get lost on leftists.

Not a single person is talking about the black police chief who was killed, the black people who are injured during the ensuing violence, etc.

We could make the same argument for mandating hazmat suits. Would you be upset about it then?

"*We can stop disease right now if we all just agree that we care about others and wear hazmat suits - use the decontamination chambers provided by your government/employers.*"

Or, alternatively, "*keep a t-shirt on your face you dolt!*" - it's the same b.s.

I actually chuckled today when I went to get my haircut and put on the required Cloth Mask™ (issued by my employer) and the stylist took it off of my face no less than 3 times to cut behind my ears. The whole time I'm thinking "oh crap, my required mask is off... she could be sick" until I remembered that it likely makes no difference at all.</div>

Isn't it nice that your opinions can be tested instead of me just deleting your comments and ignoring you?

Let's take a second to appreciate that... you absolute spud! 🙂💗

&gt;Who was it that made the post and comment with the INITIAL argument stating that the cloth masks are ineffective.

Maybe you've heard - idk if you're on the same planet I am... but if you are - **people are arguing an awful lot about the importance of wearing cloth masks.**

I didn't start saying, "put this on - for your safety" - [it was suggested by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html) (who initially argued that masks were not effective or suggested - now apparently recognized as a ploy to secure PPE for medical workers).

They literally say this in that link:

&gt;The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators.  Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders, as recommended by current CDC guidance.

If N-95 respirators work so much better, why wouldn't people want what actually works? Oh, out of selflessness - that's right. The "plebs" who are spreading this stuff and who we don't want to die should just use a t-shirt instead.

It's ridiculous and that's why I said the onus is on the people claiming a t-shirt over the face is effective.

Is it better than nothing? Sure - so is a banana I imagine. A banana would at least block some of the cough particles. Maybe we should all wear bananas on our face? The argument makes as much sense without data.

&gt;A good example of this is, when compared to exercise, yoga is much less effective at health benefits. When compared to nothing, yoga is very effective.

Yeah - try to keep up dude. "*Better than nothing!*" is the stupidest reason to do anything.

We don't wear helmets - remember?

&gt;You can’t keep using the slippery slope fallacy for the greater than zero argument. Do you not give a fuck about human life?

[This video does a better job of explaining why your argument is stupid than I would (it's more entertaining too).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXWhbUUE4ko&amp;t=14s)

&gt;If I can save one life through minor inconveniences throughout my day, I fucking will.

*But are you?* Or are you not doing anything at all? 

Do you have some data that shows you're helping? 

Is my banana saving lives?

&gt;You can’t compare wearing knee pads and helmets during normal activities because you aren’t at risk of inhaling microscopic particles which can kill you and your family on a day to day basis.

I'm not sure you're keeping up with the argument dude. My point is that we weigh the pros and the cons of particular behaviors based on how risky they are. If a t-shirt over the face prevents covid-19 spread by `.00000000001%`, is it worth wearing one all day? If you say yes, how about `.0000000000000000000000000000000001%`? Do you still feel like you're saving the world or are you provably doing nothing? Are you still following along?

This is why we use actual data when we make our choices and we don't all walk around with orange slices over our face because "*the acid in the orange may kill some of the virus! It's better than nothing!*"

&gt;You should take all reasonable action to prevent exposure.

There's the word we're looking for - "reasonable." Is a t-shirt reasonable? Or is it virtue signaling?

&gt;So sure, chuck on your hazmat and look down on me, you’re still doing me a massive favour by wearing it.

But you're not - you're not caring enough about people. You should be ashamed and wear a hazmat suit too.

Will you? Can we have you in a full blown space suit by the end of this?

Or would you just stay inside which keeps everyone 100% safe from you in the first place?

&gt;I really don’t think freedom of choice is an important thing compared to being fucking alive

Yeah, you'd make a good slave. Is that what you want to be? To hear? Come on now bro.

&gt;But when your freedom of choice has a measurable impact on other and could cause them to die, and you exercise that choice in that fashion, you absolutely deserve fairy tale demon burny death.

Piss off ya wanka! Honestly I don't know what else to say to someone who wishes suffering on others because they refuse wear a banana on their face and they're not comfortable losing their freedoms.</div>

Nobody knows how effective cloth masks are - there have been next to no studies on the subject which is why it's laughable to start drafting policy requiring it. A few have come out in the past couple of weeks - many funded by the same organizations making the suggestions. Here's one:

[Studies show that respirators actually make a difference. Cloth masks, not so much:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191274/)

&gt;Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective.

But it's not even on me to prove that they're effective - it's on you, the person insisting that they are. That's how the burden of proof works.

&gt;The stark contrast between you mocking changes to save lives in your “greater than zero is always worth it” to you boasting about building a sanitation station with respirators “because you actually care about society” is fucking retarded to say the least.

Greater than zero is **not** always worth it. That was my point. If it were, we'd all wear helmets, knee pads, etc.

And deciding the bar is "cloth mask" is equally arbitrary and fatuous. That was my second point. If you want to look down on people not wearing cloth masks, why don't we throw on respirators and look down on you... and then throw on hazmat suits and look down on the respirators... etc. ad infinitum.

It's fatuous to do so.

&gt;How easily and quickly Americans displayed their clear disdain for their fellow man.

No, I'm literally defending my fellow man's freedom of choice. I don't decide their choice is wrong and then try to force them to choose the way I would personally **because I don't have disdain for them.**

&gt;I sincerely hope there is a god out there, at least a bunch of very deceitful and dishonest christians will be burning alongside my atheist ass

You hope there's a God so that people who disagree with you can suffer for eternity... and I'm the one who has "disdain for my fellow man"? Lol - how out of touch are you fam?

&gt;This is the fucking shittiest take on covid I’ve read so far. You deserved the censorship you absolute cretin

I implore you to be a better human being - maybe pull yourself up from down under, yeah?

You'll notice that I don't wish death or suffering on the people I disagree with because I'm not, as you say, a cretin.</div>

So since you guys are getting all echo-chambery, I'll offer a counterpoint.

The reason "manly men" don't want to give an inch when it comes to fear is because once you do, that's how your life is forever.

You think that disease is going to go away after covid-19? Of course not. It will *always* be "looking out for others" to wear a mask. It will *always* be EVEN BETTER to buy a hazmat suit. You think the guys with t-shirts on their face are doing enough for society? I built a sanitation station at my house along with respirators and hazmat suits for my family because I *actually care about society* (unlike *some people*).

And helmets are good, yeah, but you don't just fall on your head. You should be wearing knee pads and elbow pads too - and of course, pads for your wrists.

We could go on and on with this and the fact that you guys stop at "cloth mask good enough" and think you're making a big difference is just silly. Do you even know how much of a difference you're making? Do you have the actual data on how well cotton fabric prevents the spread of various illnesses?

And, when you acknowledge that you don't because nobody does and that you're just virtue signaling without all the data (*greater-than-zero is always worth it!*) - but more than that, policing the lives of others because of your perceived "lack of an ego" and "righteousness" - you're a shining example of why "manly men" don't wear masks. 

We do not rush blindly into changing every aspect of our society because you decide it's "just a piece of fabric."

You're the same ones that were on our side when we agreed women shouldn't be forced to wear Burkas. It was "just a piece of fabric" then - why did you care?

It's really strange to spend so much time replying to things you don't care about.

Look, I'm guessing you're probably young and a bit confused about all this stuff - I'm not trying to be a dick to you.

It's okay to disagree but not really understand your arguments well enough - that's the whole point of having a conversation and why you find yourself drawn back into it.

We argue to refine our beliefs - that's part of the reason I'm here. I want them tested by people who are capable of testing them; it can be difficult to find people who make compelling arguments, but it happens.

Anyway, my point is this: I wear a helmet when I ride my motorcycle - I wear a mask in crowded areas.

I don't do it because I have to - I do it because I'm capable of making my own decisions as an adult.

This is called "freedom" and it must be preserved.

That's my $0.02.</div>

I've noticed there are two ways people view legislating the lives of others:

1. Assume everyone is functionally retarded.

2. Assume that adults are generally reasonable.

Can you understand why I don't believe that laws should be enacted assuming that we're all actual retards? I don't mean retard as in the "that's offensive" way - I mean it as in its actual definition:

&gt;less advanced in mental, physical, or social development than is usual for one's age.

We're all adults here and the whole notion of "freedom" in general relies on two principles:

1. Freedom is the ability to make the "wrong" choice (wrong being open to interpretation)

2. Adults have the right to make their own choices

So when I see someone say that we need to "legislate away freedom because people are retarded," I disagree wholeheartedly.</div>

I didn't call you a child and accuse you of crying.

Please, PLEASE - note your hypocrisy.

You can do it - I believe in you.

&gt;crying about being banned (for being disrespectful) and when I told you to take your tampon out and report whoever hurt your feelings like a big boy

&gt;I do feel sorry for the women in your life. lol They were right.

And finally, I believe you should be free to be a dick and not be censored.

Just take a look at the types of comments I receive:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/gizgsx/proud_to_be_murican/fqioag0/

^ This is breaking reddit's TOS, it's been reported, and it's still up hours later.

I find the double standards disconcerting and you should too - that's why this sub exists.

I don't care if you want to tell me to take my tampon out and call me a baby bitch or whatever other shit you want to talk to me.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Hello again,

The sub you are currently posting in is r/RedditCensors.

This is a sub where people post about or "complain" (as you call it) about censorship that they have experienced while using reddit.

Here's a brief snippet from the FAQ that you may have missed:

&gt;This sub is dedicated to recording and highlighting instances of ideological censorship of thoughts, ideas, comments, submissions etc on reddit. 

Imagine going into a sub where people discuss their broken vehicles and saying, "*You're crying about your broken car - I'm trying to shame you into self awareness.*" Once again, I implore you to look in the mirror.

&gt;For what to be ashamed of, I'd start with jabbing at the population of the subreddit

What does this even mean? "Jabbing"? Obviously not the literal definition. 

I'm guessing you mean expressing a dissenting opinion?

I'm not ashamed for disagreeing with somebody about something.

&gt;Then the moment when you decided being banned was censorship.

Here's a little bit about the definition of the word censorship:

&gt;Censorship blocks something from being read, heard, or seen.

When banned, your comments are listed as `[removed]` as you may or may not know from using this site. I was censored by definition.

&gt;Then the long post that is nearly unintelligible because you posted so many comments. and so on...

Sorry that I ... say too much? Is that what I'm supposed to feel ashamed of?

If you have anything else to say, I'm happy to address it.</div>

Seriously, point at one thing.

I never cried - this is a sub to point out censorship - I'm pointing out censorship.

The narrative is "*Women should be proud of their periods*" - I guess because only women bleed from their vaginas that they have - although that's not really right because not all women have vaginas... although the sub is literally called TwoXChromosomes (implying that "female" is biological in nature - which, obviously it is, but not on the TwoXChromosomes sub).

It's the kind of confusing, ridiculous, nonsense that causes the entire sub to fall into a logical paradox.</div>

Do you think I'm going to go cry to my wife and kids that "donaldslabia" feels sorry for them?

Do you think I'm going to feel bad about myself and change my mind about period blood in commercials or decide to treat disrespectful people with respect?

If you're only respectful because "the rules say I'm supposed to be" then you're literally the problem, not me.

I'm a respectful person by default - not because I'm ordered to be - because it's the right thing to do.

You, however, apparently need to be instructed to be a decent human being or you'll default back to being the pile of shit that you are.

Did I get that right?

I mean, you seem to be insisting the government step in and force people to do what you think they should do.

Are you completely missing this?

The rest of us aren't uneducated idiots either - we know what we "should do." We don't need the government to tell us to. In fact, tons of people were grabbing masks back in February when the CDC was arguing that they don't do any good 🙄

That's just like, your opinion bro.

You're welcome to have it, but I don't think you made any compelling arguments.

I'm getting really tired of hearing "here's what you need to do..."

I'm an adult living in a free country (formerly the land of the free and the home of the brave). 

It's actually scary (but sadly unsurprising) how quickly the leftist "progressives" hop into pure authoritarianism under the guise of protecting the collective. Did you guys miss history? Did you forget that protecting the rights of the individual is what keeps a society free of tyranny?

Good grief.

You. Can't. Get. Sick. If. You. Follow. Your. Own. Advice.

But you don't - you won't - you know you're not capable of doing so.

You want to be able to go outside too. You acknowledge that everyone would be safer if we wore hazmat suits, but you're not willing to inconvenience yourself *that much* so you argue that a t-shirt over the face is "better than nothing!" (literally anything is) because that's the max you'll inconvenience yourself, and then you push this on others self-righteously and pat yourself on the back.

Seriously, just buy the hazmat suit for yourself and stfu - there. Now you're completely safe. You can go anywhere and do anything. You don't need to police others - we just want you to leave us alone so that we can live our lives. Nobody is coming into your house and forcing you outside - stop trying to do the equivalent to everyone else.</div>

https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gioh4j/texas_governor_says_no_one_needs_to_wear_a_mask/fqgnu19/

My comment:

I live in Texas - if you're worried, stay inside.

If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask.

If you're worried about the doctors and nurses, they don't have to go outside either.

Nobody does.

The only real question is why people who are staying inside would care about this at all.

"*BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU AND WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU!*"

Lol, even if that was true (hint: [it's not](https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g7l5ta/a_friend_offering_some_advice_to_the_covid/)), we simply don't care. 

You do your thing - stay inside - we'll do ours.

Why in the world is this controversial?

**Edit: I get tired of arguing with you guys while throttled (6 minutes between comments), but [I found a video of you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUAG6t5aN8)**

**Edit 2: Replying to the slowboats below me here since I'm not waiting 8 minutes to post another comment.**

wullymammith writes:

&gt;Some people can't stay inside 100% of the time

Nobody* can stay inside 100% of the time. 

We don't even do this to prisoners because it's considered a rights violation.

&gt;It's about the collective public health

Ahh yes, destroy the rights of the individual for the collective. Pretty much every evil ideology has used this argument - you'd get along with Margaret Sanger and all the other fun eugenicists.

**Edit 3: Responding to AhDunWantIt who has difficulty sleeping because of me.**

&gt;Essential workers and immunosuppressed people like my mother HAVE to go outside for things like doctors appointments, and your unwillingness to help make the environment they are in so much more dangerous. Wearing a cloth mask only protects those around you, not yourself. This selfishness is why I cannot sleep at night and worry for my parents.

Your parents will never run into me since I'm avoiding the doctor's office like the plague.

Honestly, it's more dangerous for them there. That's what should keep you up at night.

In fact, just get them a hazmat suit and you can sleep like a baby.

Don't blame me for your shitty sleep habits - I don't blame you or your parents for mine.

**Edit 4: Responding to FuckenGruven:**

&gt;You can't spread obesity, or smoking, or drinking, or drugs, or diabetes, or sunburn. You can spread coronavirus.

So the new suggestion is that anyone who has a communicable disease is not allowed to receive medical care.

I don't know where you guys come up with these great arguments, but keep them coming because they're hilarious.

&gt;If wearing a mask is such an infringement upon your rights, can you explain to me why nobody is up in arms about having to wear pants when they go outside? What's the difference?

He makes a good point here: people cover their genitalia when they're outside, why aren't they willing to wear a helmet and knee pads when they walk down the street?

Why aren't we adopting middle eastern garb here in America under penalty of law?

These are some good questions, but I think the answers are pretty obvious:

You don't have to wear pants outside.

You can wear shorts - heck, you can get away with a speedo if you feel so inclined.

So, let's try again with your question:

"Why must we cover our genitalia in public"?

I never endorsed that law - if you can sway the majority, best of luck 😉

**Edit 5: Responding to jus6j**

&gt;Dude it’s so fucking simple to wear fabric over your mouth and nose to keep others safe when you have to leave your house. Grow the fuck up. No shit we are trying to stay inside. Go do some MDMA, you empathy lacking prick.

As we all know, fabric over the mouth completely blocks and prevents Covid-19.

The ONLY reason it's spread across the entire world is because people aren't wearing t-shirts on their heads.

Many claps for this brave soul - unfortunately, IMO anyone without a hazmat suit is being dangerously irresponsible.

**Edit 6: Responding to i_tyrant who went straight for the ad hominem with a usernamechecksout as he ironically insults my own (lol):**

&gt;Downvote and move on, he's a shitty Texan and person and you've got better things to do.

You've got better things to do than troll someone's post history in an effort to discredit them, but i_tyrant doesn't, because he's not a "shitty Texan."

I'd find you guys funny if I didn't think it was leaning more towards evil.

**Edit 7: Responding to zinoozy:**

&gt;Well by your logic the economy will be f*cked forever. Scared and sick people stay inside! Let me live my life! (That's you). Ok so let's say they do that, do you think life will be just great? You think the economy will bounce back? You need those people to come out and spend their money and keep things running. Your proposed solution only creates more problems.

The economy will recover in states that aren't full of cowards *coughs*.

The states that are full of cowards will either come out of their hidey holes or crumble into despair.

I hope you guys figure it out.

**Edit 8: Responding to Pink3y3 (gross, don't spread your disease please):**

&gt;This comes off as so defensive it's past cringy.

"Your boos mean nothing, I've seen what makes you cheer."</div>

While you're not wrong, seeing the same lies repeated thousands of thousands of times and knowing you have one quiet voice that will be removed altogether as soon as you open your mouth gets a bit frustrating.

🙄

&gt;West Nile Virus

&gt;Guinea Worm

&gt;Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

&gt;Lyme Disease

&gt;Ross River Fever

&gt;Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever

&gt;Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever

&gt;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

&gt;Valley Fever

&gt;Marbug Virus Diseasse

&gt;Norovirus

&gt;Zika Fever

&gt;Japanese Encephalitis

&gt;German Measles

&gt;Spanish Flu

&gt;Lassa Fever

&gt;Legionnaire's Disease

But yeah, "Chinese virus" is racist.

&gt;it's the White House's inaction, spreading of confusing, conflicting info and sometime straight up misinformation, and failure to adequately prepare for and contain the virus that has, in large part, lead to the state America has found itself in.

There's a worldwide pandemic - I guess the leaders all over the world are complete failures, huh?

[Even Sweden where they didn't even bother ordering a shutdown](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-why-hasnt-sweden-gone-into-lockdown-over-covid-19-pandemic-11966132) - definitely awful, right?</div>

This has never been my experience which is why I thought it might be worth it to talk through.

The last two is where I lost him though - where he admitted that he's racist (everyone is) by saying, "*Are you really saying you have no unconscious bias about anything? I certainly can* [sic] *say that, and I don't think I could name a person who could.*"

This is how they get you: 

"*Is it possible you just don't realize you're racist?*"

Wow! I never thought of that!

It's ridiculous.</div>

This is exactly what Biden did (and for more money).

Trump asked about it and apparently that's unacceptable.

The Ukraine leaders supported Trump in this too which is quite telling.

Most of reddit spends their time whining and crying about "the rich."

It's easy to look up and lose gratitude - that's what's happened.

Quite a few college aged kids aren't proud to be Americans anymore. 

Most of the same kids think America is super racist randomly too.

This rhetoric is so damaging and completely untrue.</div>

Our country can't and won't fall apart with one bad president - we've already survived for hundreds of years.

People were screaming "doomsday!" as soon as Trump was elected... I spent the first year trying to explain that it's okay and that if our democracy was so easily destroyed it would've happened already.

I figured it would taper off after that, but it simply never did.

They were literally talking about impeaching him [BEFORE HE WAS EVEN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE](https://www.politico.eu/article/could-donald-trump-be-impeached-shortly-after-he-takes-office-us-presidential-election-2016-american-president-impeachment/).

^ you can't even make this up.

&gt;Could Trump be impeached shortly after he takes office? Donald Trump isn’t even the Republican nominee yet. But his incendiary rhetoric, most notably about killing the families of terrorists and bringing back torture, has critics on the right and the left discussing the most extreme of countermeasures at an unusually early point in the race.</div>
