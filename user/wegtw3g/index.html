    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'd advise you to actually read the Bible instead of trusting what other parties tell you about Christianity. Understanding Christianity also takes way less time than Islam because unlike Islam, everything is in one book - the Bible.

Given Christianity's structure, it would actually be sufficient to read the Gospels only, since they have Highest authority and take about 4-5 hours to read.

Text analysis on Bible is not relevant because Bible is comprised of Old and New Testament. The two happen thousands of years apart. The New Testament is like an additional contract signed for an initial contract. Yes, Old Testament was violent to some extent, however the New Testament teachings, through Christ, basically forbid human punishment. So Old Testament rules only apply if not contradicted implicitly or explicitly by the New Testament.

Quran is violent mostly because it's directly inspired from Old Testament.

Text analysis also returns false positives on New Testament because it considers parts that refer to divine judgement (mainly Revelations but also others). The difference between Christianity and Islam is that for Christianity punishment by people is forbidden, it's strictly reserved to God.

I've written a post covering one of the issues people have with New Testament here if you're interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/6a6w6a/rworldnews_muslim_posts_a_list_of_positive_quotes/dhd9af3/

But as I said initially, i'd advise you not to trust me either, just go and read the Bible.

It's not about today's society. Societies change, the texts remain. The texts/teachings (Quran and Hadith) are bipolar.

&gt;but so is EVERY OTHER RELIGION.

No it isn't. One example would be Christianity, others would be Buddhism, Janism.

&gt;are 100% rule and law

Didn't say 100%, I specifically said:

&gt;Sahih Hadiths are not up for interpretation, or at best there's a very small margin for which they can be interpreted.

So while yes, you might end up refuting some specific verses, there will be others backing them up and on the grand scheme of things the context would be the same (intolerance for other religions, violence in "self defense" and many others.

The final nail in the coffin for Islam is his own prophet, Mohammed. By his actions he has shaped Islam.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Analytical data is useless, New Testament has many claims that are not rosy but that refer specifically to the after life. Whereas Islam has many claims that would happen in the current life. Which is why muslims are more violent to begin with. Mohammed being a warlord and being an exemplary character for muslims probably doesn't help them be more peaceful.

Revelations (after life again) also probably spike the data by a lot.

Just because it seems complex and has a fancy name (analytical data) doesn't mean it adds value.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; The positive of the Quran far outweighs the negative, and that I will vehemently stand by.

It doesn't, but we would obviously disagree on that. 

The concern is, and i'm not trying to be disrespectful, is that Islam is bipolar. Yes, there's obviously good stuff there, nobody can deny that. There's lots of bad stuff there also, and that's the problem. The main problem is the example Mohammed was, since he is the standard for muslims. Yes, he did nice things, but he also did an awful lot of reprehensible things, yet he's paradoxically an exemplary character.

Compared to Jesus of Christianity, Mohammed is not even a contender.

Sahih Hadiths are not up for interpretation, or at best there's a very small margin for which they can be interpreted. They have to exist and be accepted because Quran on itself does not offer that much information.

Yes, that's about Banu Qurayza.

&gt;He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam.

&gt;When the tribe of Banu Qurayza was ready to accept Sad's judgment, Allah's Apostle sent for Sad who was near to him. Sad came, riding a donkey and when he came near, Allah's Apostle said (to the Ansar), "Stand up for your leader." Then Sad came and sat beside Allah's Apostle who said to him. "These people are ready to accept your judgment." Sad said, "I give the judgment that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as prisoners." 

That's from Bukhari also. So yes, he was referring to the jews initially, and that's what happened to them eventually. He was also referencing Christians for some reason

The point is that the initial quote is just a small part of the attitude muslims have over other religions (especially non abrahamic ones). The second quote was supporting the first. We can go an find countless ones both in Quran and other sahih Hadiths. 

&gt;Does a couple verses in the Quran about war and the supposed future mean that all Muslim are angry extreme killers? Come on.

It's not just Quran, it's Hadiths too. And it's not just a couple of verses, it's about the attitude and the example of Mohammed. Generally muslims are nice until you do something that is considered hostile, whatever that is. Then you're fucked.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If I remember correctly, /europeannationalism was designed and admitted as safe space /echochamber for conservatives back when /european was still up and admins didn't ax it. Idea was to keep /european free speech(and you could've literally posted everything there) and the other sub to be
more of a thing where people get away from others.

The issue here is that most conservative subs, and i do agree there are plenty, are truthful for their orientation or bias, whereas huge subs that are supposedly "neutral" by name such as /europe /worldnews /politics are obviously left leaning and no mod admits it, and they shape the sub's narrative.

T_D admitted it's a sub concerned with circlejerking and that to keep the momentum up will ban other opinions. I personally think that's dumb but then again, at least they're being honest about it.

Incorrect. Those are sahih (authentic) Hadiths. I've chosen them specifically over Quran to show people Islam is not Quran only. Providing Quran quotes, while easy, would've missed the Hadiths again.

Hadiths are integral to Islam. Which is the main problem that most people don't get, that is they assume Islam = Quran. However, Islam = Quran+Hadiths. Most Islamic law is derived from the Sunnah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah , that is the life and teachings of Mohammed. Quran has little to none of that, it's extensively covered in Hadiths. Quran also references Mohammed as an exalted (standard of) character which is what makes the Hadiths integral to Islam.

When I mentioned the two are the highest authority hadiths it obviously meant they are the highest authority ones AMONG the rest of the Hadiths. Hadiths come in different degrees of authenticity, which is why it's not a good idea to quote lower authority ones (and which is why I've chosen sahih ones). The debates in Islam is whether to accept other Hadiths except sahih (authentic) ones like Bukhari Muslim etc, for example including hasan (good) Hadihs. You can read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith

As I said in the original comment, Quran has plenty of examples as well, and there's even more in Hadiths. My concern was to remind people that sahih Hadiths are integral to Islam, there's no such thing as Quran only Islam. That's just Quranists, a small group of people considered apostates by rest of muslims.

/u/ikulol this should cover your concern as well.</div>
