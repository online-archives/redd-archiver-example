It's a sub for mod deleted submissions. there was other subreddits like this because the defaults were working around the undeleted submissions.   One of the better methods was to just unlist it and relist for various reasons.

/r/UndeleteShadow and /r/UndeletePredictions are also subreddits that were used last election because reddit was die hard banning or deleting submissions en passe.    

UndeletePredictions was my favorite and I actually used it for the Covington Kids fiasco not long ago.  It was pretty accurate in 2016 because of the Narrative Reddit was pushing.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">politics helds its rules in such a way that it will let others break it if it is within the narrative of what they are pushing.   Recently /r/videos was doing the same with the Covington Kids.   They only post politics related videos UNLESS it goes against the narrative then they ban it.  

If you actually look at /r/politics in a day to day basis its 90% anti-trump often fake news (let me know trump is done this time).   None of those stories pan out and most are dismissed as fake news in 72hrs.

politics as a subreddit was never like this in 2016.   Some of those stories paned out.   

It should be for open discussion but I dare you to state something or use a source for that fact on something that is actual news and not clickbait or antitrump.  In the first 30min you are downvoted -50.   Whether it is true or not.    

There are many subreddits breaking site wide rules and the Admins do nothing this is brought up time and again.  Pay attention to /r/undeleted for a bit.  At one time there had been 3 undeleted type subreddits. only undeleted is still active semi.

If you pay attention long enough you start to read the code like the matrix.   It's not a ban here or a ban there I can read it like it is a picture.</div>

You will also see a MOD overhaul of most "Default" subs and mass bannings of anyone that spoke out against the Narrative to Be.   This actually lead to TheDonald and other subs that are considered Right wing.   You will also see subs like conspiracy get mass brigaded (I still see them using mediamatters as a source.)

Politics quit using Shareblue/Mediamatters after months/years of criticism but they still are being pushed hard on MSM literal fake news.

Articles state politics was sold off for around 2mil.  Other subs no clue but they all had mod changes around that time.</div>

People rely on that sub to understand what&#39;s going on. Those mods are controlling the conversation through mod abuse.</a>

He won't.  Most these guys who demand proof, citations, context, etc. Are just doing it to waste your time.   They only read headlines and refuse to read/watch the full context of the content.   

If they can't spend 5minutes to do their own research they won't spend 15min to read an article or 2hrs for a video.</div>

There is absolute proof via time and multiple subbreddits that the admins and mods and Super/Pacs talk in Discord.   These people are pure projectionists and whatever they accuse lesser subreddits of doing they are in fact doing themselves.

Most Default subreddits had their entire mod lists removed and switched in a course of a month or so.    Reddit is pay to play.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Back before Reddit sold out I called out a mod of OWS (occupy Wall Street) about similar things.  Turned out he was working with the feds and was a censor mod.  Really flipped my image of Reddit.   This place is counter info tech.   Most subreddit in the last year or so which were defaults were replaced of mods.  It's been systematic to the highest bidder</div>
