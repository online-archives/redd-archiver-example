    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You're struggling with the definitions of common words.  You make claims that are wildly askew of scientific consensus. You claim that I'm making ad hominem attacks by disparaging your disdain of actual science.

If you actually cared about science you'd stop using the right wing talking points. It also makes you look like you just learned about, and don't understand, the list of logical fallacies when you attempt to use them incorrectly. 

When someone points out something you're doing, guess what? It's not an ad hominem attack.

You want me to believe that you're arguing in good faith?  Right.

The only point you brought up was the lack of a measurable goal.  You don't think there's a measurable goal? It really shows that you have a completely bizarre and ill informed view of the pandemic that runs against every single country in the world. How could you claim that there's no measurable goal?

It's pretty simple. It's less death.

Are you going to bring up co morbidity to discount the covid numbers?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm guessing you can't parse the difference between the church and the bike shop because you haven't looked into the science behind this. There's a good reason the two are treated differently.

Who stopped you from going to your sisters house? Are people patrolling around and stopping people from going to family houses? I've seen plenty of idiots going to their family's houses. Pictures posted online, people in my neighborhood, etc... Guaranteed there's gonna be a huge covid bump in two weeks.

How were riots and Biden election parties allowed and who allowed them? Was there some sort of notice sent out? 

You really need plant seeds or a baby seat, it seems like there's lots of places to buy them. In fact I bought plant seeds recently and my brother had to buy a child's car seat.  Doesn't really seem like those items are banned or anything. Maybe it was a mistake at home depot. If you really need a car seat from that specific store maybe order it online.

It really doesn't seem like you know very much about what's happening with the lockdowns. Maybe you just need to do a little research and you won't be so angry.

Remember, just because a meme riles you up doesn't mean it's true</div>

See, the thing I think you still don't understand is that it's not any one person. The decisions to lockdown and enforce curfews are proven to work.  It's math. It's science. 

But I guess if you don't trust math and science they that doesn't mean much.</div>

Do you think the curfew helps prevent the spread in any way? Personally I've been horrified by people packing bars and house parties in a completely unreasonable response to social distancing requests.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">If anyone made the lockdown political it was the idiots that are unable to wear a mask, avoid giant crowds and claimed a virus that has now killed 262,000 people was fake.

A lockdown serves a purpose. There is lots and lots of science to back that up, unless you only like sources that confirm your bias of "lockdowns are evil". 

The idea that you could make a statement that broad and ill informed with your user name is what's really bewildering.

Not only is it akin to saying heart disease or cancer is fake but it's like going around giving people free cigarettes and deep fried butter sticks while laughing about how gullible everyone is.

You say you're looking for conservative subreddits.  A conservative subreddit should not be the same thing as being stupid or anti science. Please stop making it easy for people to conflate the two.</div>
