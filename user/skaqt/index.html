    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You seem to be very keen on being utterly in denial, so let me post some absolutely irrefutable evidence for you.

The nazis were never socialists, marxists or communists period. They rejected every vital tenet of socialism. They rejected class struggle, embraced private property (when it suited them) and their entire economic policy was one of privatization and corporatism, the literal opposite of socialism.

But you don't have to listen to me, why not listen to the leading authorities on this subject?

"Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the "common good", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organisation, which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism."

This is paraphrased from Ian Kershaw, who was literally the leading authority on Nazism outside of Germany for decades.

Or you could go straight to the source, simply read "Road to Resurgence" by Hitler himself, an entire pamphlet with the only purpose of appeasing to wealthy industrialists and promoting policies that *they* would like. 

Or you could actually read "Mein Kampf" and realise that a sizeable portion of the book is literally about **anti-communism**, "anti-bolshevism" and other forms of anti-leftism. Virtually every historian in the world agrees that the Nazis were fervently anti-communist, **even moreso than other fascists**, like the Italians.

You want empirical evidence? No problem. How about this study, where the author clearly explains that the party consisted mostly of small businessmen and civil servants, and never actually had a foothold with socialists, or even workers in general. (I refer to page 295): [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026569148101100302?casa\_token=cND3mjvsdAkAAAAA:EMVzs6umO8Lqhb9uK7uMQPXhpWYnn2NmBI-XBHxKDAaFb9-wiuX7O9XZRVDei4zwCAo4m827LqcL](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026569148101100302?casa_token=cND3mjvsdAkAAAAA:EMVzs6umO8Lqhb9uK7uMQPXhpWYnn2NmBI-XBHxKDAaFb9-wiuX7O9XZRVDei4zwCAo4m827LqcL)

The paper even specifically states that the Nazis only named themselves socialists *as a grift*, to steal people away from the SPD and KPD. And surprise: It did not work at all. Before 1930 less than 7% of the members were actually industrial workers, and the industrial workers were overwhelmingly supporting actual socialists.

Still not convinced? How about an actual photo of the Nazis literally calling for the death of all Marxists: [https://cdn.britannica.com/39/71439-050-F63172BB/banner-Nazis-Tod-dem-Marxismus.jpg](https://cdn.britannica.com/39/71439-050-F63172BB/banner-Nazis-Tod-dem-Marxismus.jpg)

Even a highly conservative publication like Britannica is absolutely unanimous about the Nazis not being socialists. 

Richard Evans, the leading british authority on 20th century Germany, had this to say: "‘It Would Be Wrong to See Nazism as a Form of, or an Outgrowth From, Socialism’"

Joachim Fest, who was a Hitler biographer and leading German historian of the 3rd Reich said this: "This ideology took a leftist label chiefly for tactical reasons. It   
demanded, within the party and within the state, a powerful system of   
rule that would exercise unchallenged leadership over the “great mass of  
 the anonymous.” And whatever premises the party may have started with,   
by 1930 Hitler’s party was “socialist” only to take advantage of the   
emotional value of the word, and a “workers’ party” in order to lure the  
 most energetic social force. As with Hitler’s protestations of belief   
in tradition, in conservative values, or in Christianity, the socialist   
slogans were merely movable ideological props to serve as camouflage and  
confuse the enemy."

The superb irony of you claiming the Nazis were socialists in light of the indisputable fact that the Nazis indeed murdered all of the German socialists they could get their hands on is at best comical, at worst utterly depressing. From Wiki:"German Communists were among the first to be imprisoned in concentration camps"

"Imprisoned" of course being a nice euphemism for killed. Some of my own relatives were killed in concentration camps not for being socialists, but just moderate social democrats. 

I'll gladly own up to the historical failures of socialism, they were manifold. Stalin's Russia, the Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot were all *to some degre*e socialist, and were absolutely horrible. Nazi Germany wasn't. My post may reek of someone repeating what they're told, sure, but that's likely because I actually did spend a significant time studying the 3rd Reich, unlike you my friend.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't think your post deserved a ban, but it was absolutely incredibly stupid. You literally take Nazi propaganda at face value to establish that the Nazis were socialists, s position that not a single respected historian today clings to.

In fact there is a mountain of evidence that lets us know that the main sponsors of the NSDAP were heavy industry like Thyssen Krupp, since they were going broke without a war to keep them afloat. We also do know for a fact that the Nazi policies - which matter much more than something Hitler said in some quote, as if he was reliable.. - were explicitly corporatist and capitalist. Lastly, the Nazis came to power by vehementlyopposing socialism and communism, the Nazis killed literal thousands of socialists and even moderate social Democrats (SPDler) were sonetimes sent to concentration camps.

The beautiful irony of your post is that you quote Strasser to prove that the Nazis were socialists, because apparently you're unaware that the Nazis themselves killed Strasser because he was too much of a leftist (he really wasn't, btw). This is all Wikipedia-tier knowledge that even highschoolers learn in Germany.

You call yourself an expert on Nazi and Communist propaganda, but your post reeks of someone who has never read a single monography about Nazi Germany in his life.
