As a programmer,  it would just irritate the shit out of me to be interrupted if I was making progress on something.  I tend to work in bursts. Sometimes only an hour , other times it could be 6hrs straight. Get a lot done in that time,  then spend more time getting basically nothing done.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/3208926#18612650">Why Software Engineering is hard</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>To me, this guys opinion shines a bit of a light on why big companies tend to end up writing shit code. If they basically fire the people who just want to code (and code well), because they think they aren't progressing enough, and they think that Software Engineering is the most important part (i.e. you can just outsource the coding). This is how you end up with really shit code. You outsource your coding to juniors/interns/indians, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, he is right in that there is more to Software Engineering than just coding, but without coding there is no software, and a Software Engineer who has lost touch with coding is liable to make some significant errors in design. </p>
<p>If Google etc fire good coders because they don't want to be software engineers, they are fucking morons. Some people just like coding, and are good at it.</p>
<p>Imagine if you got a really good architect to design your house, then you just employed a bunch of first year apprentices and immigrant laborers to build it. It would look something like the architect's design, but it wouldn't fit together well and wouldn't work well, because you need BOTH good design and good construction.</p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Ah, ok. no worries. My setup is a 17&quot; laptop with another 24&quot; screen. Haven't gone mobile for work, but I'd probably use a similar setup. Depends on how you're travelling. Are you in your own vehicle (can modify it), if so you could make your own office in a van or something. If you're travelling more conventionally, it could be trickier lugging all that stuff around. Maybe if you were staying in one spot for a few days/weeks, you could rent an additional monitor.</p>
<p>I know for marketing trips, my boss generally buys a monitor/TV for presentations when he gets to wherever he's going (cheaper than transporting it and having the baggage handlers break it anyway), then he gives it away to someone when he's done. But that's a more specific type of use case than coding.</p>
<p>I could imagine working from something like a caravan, but it's not something I've needed to do yet.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Been working from home for about 3 years now. It's pretty good for me as the alternative is a 2hr+ commute each way (though I do go into work one day a week. It's good to physically see the people you work with from time to time). A lot will depend on your specific circumstances, your personality, what your work culture is like, what your managers are like, etc. You will need to have a reasonable level of self discipline though, it can be easy to get distracted (like browsing Voat for an hour or so when you should be working). </p>
<p>As mentioned by <a href="https://voat.co/u/GlamourSpork">@GlamourSpork</a>, you'll need some equipment for stuff like webex, my work also uses an in-house (hosted on our own server) messaging app (we use Pidgin). Probably 90% of my communication with the office is done through that. Using text chat is handy in that it's not immediate (you don't know if the person you are messaging is sitting at their desk, they might be taking a shit or something) and there is a log, so you can go back and reference stuff that you talked about.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, it will depend on where you are. Where I am, I can claim tax deductions on much of what I use for my home office. That includes equipment (computers, keyboards, monitors, etc) and services (I can claim part of my power bill, part of my internet bill, etc). I just use a work supplied laptop with an additional monitor that I already had. Buy yourself a nice keyboard and mouse and a comfortable chair (since you'll be using them all day).</p>
<p>Anything else you want to know, just ask.</p></div>

<p>If you can't think of anything right now,  maybe look at something like Project Euler (<a href="https://projecteuler.net">https://projecteuler.net</a>) to give you some problems to tackle. </p>
<p>The language you use is up to you.  I'd probably start with either C# or Java</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The only way I can see this failing is if the variables are Objects, rather than primitive types. I.e. if they are Integer, rather than int.</p>
<p>If they are Objects, then use:</p>
<p><code>else if(x.equals(y) &amp;&amp; x.equals(z)) { point1 = point1 + 5; }</code></p>
<p>Like others have said, you can omit the third comparison as it is redundant.
Obviously here you will have to be sure that x is not null too, or that if it is null, that y and z are also null.</p>
<p>There is also a possibility that the problem is in the preceding if statement, since this is an else/if. Hard to say without seeing more of the code though.</p></div>

<p>More dangerous than a DDoS would be if someone was to hack into IoT stuff like internet connected switches (you can get them pretty cheap) and turn them all on/off at once. If a bunch of people have installed internet connected heaters, kettles, etc. You could cause a massive power spike which could cause significant damage to infrastructure.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Wouldn't worry about a formal degree. I have a degree in Computer Science, but rarely ever use anything I learnt at uni in the real world (have worked as a professional developer for over a decade). </p>
<p>I suppose programming is as much a craft as a science, you learn far more by just doing, and talking to experienced people. If you're lucky, you'll run into some good experienced coders who can help you learn things faster (i.e. you don't need to make the same painful mistakes as everyone else).</p>
<p>If you are wondering what your employer expects of you, maybe just ask them. They know you don't have any formal programming training, but they still hired you, so obviously they have some confidence in your ability to code. I'd recommend learning about aspects of programming that interest you, no point learning about something that you don't like, then ending up getting a job doing the thing that you don't like :-).</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>It's somewhat unclear what the age field of Girl refers to. Based on how it is used in the willGoOutWith() method, it seems to refer to the age of Guy, but it <s>is</s> [should be] passed in as a parameter to the constructor of Girl, implying that it would be a property of Girl. </p>
<p>Overall, this is shitty code on multiple levels, if someone produced this sort of code in an application to work at my company, they would not be hired.</p></div>
