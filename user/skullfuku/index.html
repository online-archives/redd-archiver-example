        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>RMS is an autismcel and (((lisp))) Kaspar Hauser who spent most of his life in MIT's basement. He has a vague understanding that he does not fit in and desperately cosplays as a real human for more cringe. His political stance was molded by MIT, a breeding ground for communism, degeneracy, and a magnet for jewry. RMS is a genius programmer and posix nerd, but he clearly overdosed the MIT kool-aid. RMS never got over the loss of his beloved pdp-10 at an early age, because the platform was abolished by DEC in favor of the vax, which RMS hated.. He is also frustrated by the fact that the bad guys keep winning, like Symbolics in 1984 and Microsoft in 1995. Also note that most people believe RMS is a retarded sidekick of Linus Torvalds, what he actually is, because Torvalds is less of an asspie and thus a better politician, leader and marketer, thereby out-jewing (((RMS))) as a genetic finoswede. So there he is, RMS, at the end of a life sentence without parole and without a bathtub, advocating degeneracy as if he weren't a complete incel while travelling the world dressed like Merkel at a barbeque. Perhaps you guys hate the man less if you understand his tragic past. RMS habitually makes it easy for enemies (most people) to quotemine his public utterances, thereby rendering him more batshit crazy than Noam Chomsky, also in the MIT asylum for the comically insane. (Noam Chomsky does not eat his own foot funghus in public and limits his talks to two hours.)</p></div>

<p>Loud, obnoxious, constantly swearing while </p>

<p>Not your fault, it's a management fail. 1 programmer = 1 office, or your
company leaves a lot of money on the table. He who manages a chip-factory
and puts the carpentry and the den with cats into the fab with the
high-purity filters makes himself the laughing stock of the industry.
He who manages a programming factory and jams thinkers into cubicles
makes himself a model of frugality for some reason. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our manager never trusted him to communicate with clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smart manager. Gifted engineers often suck with people. That's why
incellism is so epidemic among prodigy programmers. You will have
difficulty using a modern formula-1 race car in a dirt-track competition. 
Lock programmers in the basement and make sure they never see clients
or female employees, not even at lunch. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>pair program</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Might yield good results occasionally, but as a way of programming
it drives most people into contemplating suicide or leaving for a
company without pair programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Almost done&quot; is a meaningless fucking statement. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a piggy-bank for quarters in meetings. He who says &quot;now, that's
totally easy&quot; or &quot;almost done&quot; pays a quarter as a penalty. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stupid. Pointless. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Might be on to something; hard to tell without specifics. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>he thought an interface was the same thing as a class</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OOP is probably overrated for Non-UI code, but that gap in his knowledge
is indeed a red flag. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didn't understand that his poorly written code was 
in fact, not doing the same thing as the 
method from that very helpful library.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your library? I'm not trying to piss you off, but often
a maternal view is unhelpful. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he got stuck, time to bother our contractor for 
an answer, or just be completely lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Source code is only marginally easier to comprehend than a
hex-listing of machine code. Documentation solves most problems
if it is taken seriously and not as a hoop to jump through for
audits. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally took credit for things I did. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>OMG punch his face in minesweeper. Unironically very bad style, 
probably a criminal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Didn't own up to bugs he would create. Just blamed the 
codebase for being stupid and overly complicated with all 
these nonsense classes and such. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have seen shit like that where every one, including the authors,
agreed that that was indeed the state of the matter. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have inherited a project he was working on </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could be worse. Most of the time, the idiot who cobbled together some
crock of entropy that blows a fuse upon all edge-cases is the smart, efficient
worker-bee and you, who is later supposed to fix &quot;a few problems&quot; with
very slow progress due to clarity-fails, obfuscation, stack-exchange pasta
and cargo cult is the retarded under-achiever and low-potential. </p>
<p>You are totally right in that the software &quot;industry&quot; is fundamentally
broken, even without obnoxious work-mates.</p></div>
