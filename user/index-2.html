I based my prices off of USD, which is Index $999 USD (which comes with Alyx, so a better deal than I bought it for a couple years ago, damn) and Quest 2 at $399 USD.

Like I said, I understand. It was my first foray too but I preferred to get something that I knew the tech would still be current a few years down the road (which it is, it's still way ahead of the games right now) plus the added bonus of supporting a company that does things I like (usually, I didn't like that they built an alternative steam client for China, but I get it), but to each his own.

That's good that you're finding ways to block facebook out of your life. I hate everything that company does and stands for.</div>

Of course you haven’t. Why would he tell you something that contradicts his arguments about Apple. 

>They only have access to screens and batteries

And boards if they are an authorized shop. You don’t seem to know the difference between board level and component level repair. The important thing to know is that no factory repair shop for any brand does component level repair. The time it takes and the expertise required don’t add up when compared to replacing the board or device. The real truth about shops like Rossman’s is he pays his techs a fraction of what they are worth and can barely do repairs for less than the cost of replacement. His own videos complain about this. Apple doesn’t provide their own factory shops with components because the cost in time and labor is too high. They only provide boards to anyone, Rossman ain’t special. I don’t repair TVs anymore because the diagnostic fees were half the replacement cost. 

>Modular phones and other tech have been tried and failed because it’s niche, I’m aware of this but I have hope that it finally takes off.

Help me out here, what’s it called when you do the same thing over and over and expect different results? That’s what this modular laptop is. 

>Apple restricts their chip manufacturers from selling to anyone but them.

So does every other manufacturer with custom chips. This is in no way unique to Apple. Rossman is trying to make a business model work that died 20 years ago and blames everyone but himself. No one, and I mean no one does factory authorized component level repair on any device from any manufacturer.</div>

If modular laptops were viable, we would have had them 20 years ago. Further, Apple doesn’t do component level repair at any shop including the factory shops so Rossman’s shop is one of the unauthorized shops that doesn’t tell you how many devices become unrepairable and leaves a customer in the lurch because Apple won’t touch it once it’s been “repaired”. 

I’ve done component level repair on TVs and sound equipment so I know what this business is about. Rossman peddles outrage videos on the thing he makes a living from. I wouldn’t take your apple junk to him if someone else paid. 

Final note, if his shop was so successful, why did he have to move out and find a cheaper place? He would have you believe it was the rent going up, but the truth is more likely that he’s getting outcompeted by authorized repair shops because everyone’s rent goes up over time. He isn’t special and no one is picking on him. He just blames his failure on apple and new york and not his own business decisions.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don’t know why you’re trying so hard to convince me this is a good idea. I don’t dispute that. My point is that this has been tried several times before and they all failed for the same reason. A laptop isn’t a desktop. For the price point these devices are at, they are gonna get their teeth kicked in by the rest of the market. If the top end machine was $1200-1300 they might have a chance, but hardly anyone is going to spend more than a MBP for less than half the battery life and middling performance. 

That’s my point, it’s not that a modular laptop is a bad idea, it’s that these will fail for the same reason as all the other attempts. They are way, way too expensive for what you get. The final nail in their coffin will be that by the time these get any market penetration, everyone will be moving to Arm64, especially laptops. They are moving the wrong direction, way too late, for too high a price point. A niche market won’t keep this company going. 

Also, Louis Rossman is a huckster that wouldn’t agree to Apple’s repair shop terms so he makes videos talking shit about his failed repair shop and makes no mention of the dozens of other shops that have no problems getting Apple parts and are cheaper than Apple factory repair.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>So like with every other laptop?

Yeah, and pretty much every one of them is cheaper. 

>Wait, you mean if I break my Apple MacBook, I can take it to any Apple store only? 

Hardly. There are tons of authorized repair shops that are cheaper than apple. 

> Their(sic) schematics will be available to repair shops (meaning not shops with framework written on the outside) and these places will be able to order chips from suppliers.

That’s the same for any device, only you paid way more to be in that same boat. 

>I would gladly pay a premium if it meant I own the hardware and don't lease/ rent it from the manufacturer and if the rest of the parts are perfectly serviceable I can just upgrade the mainboard every 4 years to keep up.

The jury is still out on that and will be until these part become obsolete. I don’t know where you get the notion that you don’t own other devices. Finally, one thing that sets apple apart is you can trade your devices in and they hold value. For less than an entry level laptop each year, I can have the newest MacBook with coverage. The cost of entry is the same for an equivalent business grade laptop with software.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It is what it is. You’re paying for a laptop that only one company makes parts for and you’re dependent on them for all future support and upgrades. At least with Apple, if you have AppleCare, you can take it to any service center. What will you do if this company folds due to poor sales and you need to replace one of the components that only they sell?

You’re really just choosing a different walled garden and it’s a tiny one with little sunlight. Maybe it’s a good idea, but people have been trying to make modular laptops for years and they never get anywhere because you can always get the same specs for way cheaper and the market rewards cheap, not modular. MacBooks are hindered by their price and these laptops are more expensive than that.

Edit: they are also breaking it off in you with that licensing cost. It shouldn’t be more than $100 for Pro.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You understand that if it ships with windows, then you pay the licensing fee whether you use it or not? If they don’t offer a version without windows and lower the price accordingly, you’re throwing money away. 

Any laptop that mandatory ships with windows is ripping you off if you can’t get it without.  On top of all that, it’s a middling laptop with MBP prices. All these things combined mean it won’t last a year. 

There are plenty of windows laptops that will eat that one’s lunch on price at the same performance and if I’m paying a premium, I should get to choose if I have a $100-$200 dollar license attached.</div>

AGREE TO CONTINUE: FRAMEWORK LAPTOP
Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads. It’s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit “agree” to use devices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don’t read and definitely can’t negotiate.

**To use the Framework Laptop, you *have* to agree to:**

Request for your language, region, and keyboard layout

**Windows 10 License Agreement**

**Sign in to a Microsoft account**
PIN

The following agreements are optional:

Connecting to Wi-Fi
Set up the fingerprint sensor

Privacy settings, including Find My Device, inking and typing, advertising ID, location, diagnostic data, and tailored experiences

Customize your device for gaming, schoolwork, creativity, entertainment, family, and / or business

OneDrive backup

Microsoft 365 free trial

Let Microsoft collect and use information including your location and location history, contacts, voice input, speech and handwriting patterns, typing history, search history, calendar details, content, and communication history from Microsoft services, messages, and apps, as well as your browsing history in Microsoft Edge, to help Cortana provide personalized experiences and relevant suggestions

That’s six mandatory agreements and 12 optional ones to use this product.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">"Too much free expression," as though that's a bad thing? How can a service provide "too much" free expression anyway? What does that even mean? As though expression is this weaselly, slippery thing that needs to be kept firmly wrestled down lest it escape and accidentally get people to think in a different way, god forbid. 

It's the normalization of censorship. They're making restriction of speech the norm and freedom of expression the outlier because their end goal is the abolishment of Freedom of Speech in the US and likely many other first world countries around the world. And once that's gone, anything is possible.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You could potentially gain a massive increase in computational power, if utilized properly.

Prime number generation is notoriously slow in classical computers. We have a ton of ways to mitigate and prevent re-solving, but it's still slow. This slowness is what grants our encryption so much security, taking centuries or millennia to crack with current hardware. But with quantum computing, where you could potentially generate all of the combinations simultaneously, and remove the options that don't fit... There's a possibility we change the complexity from "Please write a word for word match of the thesis I have before me... without ever seeing the thesis or knowing the subject" to the complexity of multiple choice. 

Your GPS could suddenly find top three routes across the united states in a matter of micro-seconds instead of minutes. It could find the routes while considering all of the suburban and back roads instead of just highways and freeways.

The knapsack problem might be solved.

There are a lot of potential applications. From security to networking, probability to chemical structures, mathematics to art. We don't really know the limits until we explore them.

Nothing get financial backing here unless it has a recurring revenue model. No one is going to give you a loan to build these robots unless they come with a subscription. Case in point, motorcycle airbags that won’t work if you don’t pay the monthly fee. 

Russia isn’t hindered by bullshit like that, so they can make and sell robots cheap enough that grubhub can afford it. If they were made here, it would be cheaper to just hire someone.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I had nothing but bad experiences with Parler.

I probably can't even recall all of it but of what I can recall...

- They have "Delete" and "Deactivate" options. Both Deactivate. 

- When they came back from being shut down, you could not delete your account. Support wouldn't respond to anything either. Eventually they did respond to me and claimed they would delete my account.

- About a month later I got an e-mail from Parler suggesting accounts to follow. I was able to log in an delete my account. But this means they did not delete my account.

- A few weeks later, I got an e-mail from Parler with announcements and encouraging me to follow Parler Support. My account is finally "deleted" (probably just not active) but their e-mail system is independent of the actual site and there's no mechanism to let them know who is and is not active on the site. 

It's a mess. 

I'm sticking with Minds and Ruqqus. MeWe seemed okay too. I just don't want too many accounts.</div>

Then I create  a simple HTML file and open it with a browser. Even if you don't code the HTML is simple enough.

`<a href="LINKHERE">Text To Click</a>` 

Example

`<a href="https://www.ruqqus.com">CLICK HERE TO GO TO RUQQUS</a>` 

Result: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">CLICK HERE TO GO TO RUQQUS</a>

You just save the txt file with a .html extension then open it with any browser. You should be able to right click the link and save the video.

The link should end with a file extension like .mp4, .mov, .mpeg or whatever.</div>

It works for them because the cable is lowly buried, largely completely non functional steady light, disturbed by deformation. Most cables run parallel to existing infrastructure. Light is used instead of electricity, there is no processing capacity within the lines, only repeaters have that ability, and in the conus, runs are typically not long enough to require them, as they can run depending on conditions, 40 to 60 miles without needing a repeater. Now whether your neighbor’s ring camera or not is carrying data of you shitting on his lawn over the line, that’s another thing.</div>

He is a very wise engineering focused CEO, but he isn't the premium engineer people make him out to be.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Right, because success as a businessman is intrinsically tied to how safe your self driving vehicles are. 

Fun side note, since it'll tickle your funny bone: prototype Tesla was not his invention, or even his idea, he just provided funding and marketing. Yet he's lauded as the next genius inventor rather than the sponsor he is. He's like Mark Cuban, except people give him all the credit because he made PayPal once upon a time.

Nobody is treating Jeff like he's a rocket scientist even though he built his book selling website from scratch, and Blue Origin has a NASA contract.</div>
