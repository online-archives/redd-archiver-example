&gt;Oh really. Maybe they just don't put up with hate and bigotry and actual fascism and are sick and tired of right-wingnuts being the only ones that use violence. I applaud them for risking their lives in the interest of a better world - one where hate and bigotry is not tolerated. Tolerance of intolerance is not tolerance, it's foolishness.

You applaud violent authoritarianism? That would make you a fascist. Are you also a racist? You might be seeing so much white supremacy around because you are projecting onto others what is in your heart. Don't judge people by the color of their skin but the content of their character.

&gt;If there weren't hateful violent ideology behind the fascism of white nationalism, then there wouldn't be Antifa. There simply wouldn't be any reason for it to exist.

Incorrect. They would find a new excuse to violently promote their ideology (like they did at the WTO conferences and the G20 and G8 conferences). They are violent authoritarians.</div>

And attempt to push their ideology through violence.


&gt;What views are "Antifa" intolerant of? Ohhhh.. just intolerance, hate, genocide, bigotry, all the typical white nationalist things, and the fascism that comes with it. 

And free market liberalism. Black bloc protesters regularly attend G8 and G20 meetings and bring along their violence.


&gt;Intolerance of intolerance is not intolerance. You may think Antifa are fascists, but that's being very disingenuous. By your logic then we have two groups of fascists battling each other. Only one side is doing it from a position of actual hate of "the other". 

No. One is from a position of hatred of racial groups another is of hatred of economic and political class.

Yes there would. Antifa doesn't only "combat" white nationalists and fascism they also "combat" capitalism and globalism. Antifa are violent authoritarians.</div>

Those aren't "fascist" policies, they are just policies of evil regimes. Pol Pot is the perfect example that racism and genocide know no political affiliation.

They are fascist because they are intolerant of views, their actions show them to be exclusionary and want to centralize power to only the "faithful". They attempt to violently suppress their political opponents. They are violent authoritarians.</div>
