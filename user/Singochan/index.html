    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are right, but you are also somewhat off.  The conservative right is as you say, very religious and believe in bans on things their brand of religion does not agree with.  That said, they are more pro free speech.  But the real point I wanted to make is that classical liberals, and libertarians have also now been grouped in with the right wing, and these two groups do believe in freedom.  Basically anybody who actually believes in personal freedoms is cast out from the left and labeled right wing, so in that respect the vast majority of those believing in freedom are called right wing.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">He definitely is a grifter and thief.  The inciting an insurrection, give me a break.  I honestly don't even want to debate with a person who is either so stupid or so far up the medias ass to call Jan 6th an  insurrection, or that it was incited by Trump, who literally told them to go peacefully in their protest.  Those are the words from his mouth, from the mouth of Trump.  You are just running down the literal left wing news talking points,  which is funny because they claim he's destabilizing democracy by claiming cheating.  Then what the hell were dems doing when they claimed cheating in 2016 and 2000?  Or it doesn't count when they do it?You call them wanting to not have mail in voting election manipulation?  The entire mail in vote scheme was election manipulation, how blind can a person be to not realize that. 

But again, my entire main point has nothing to do with whether he is fit to be president or not, it has to do with the vast majority of people who have no actual clue other than 1 sentence news headlines telling them to hate Trump.   And as I already stated of course you can find real reasons in an online forum debate, people can look it up.  But ask someone in real life and their reasons will be paper thin, just proving people are sheep that do and think as the media tells them.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Now this is you buying into the lie.  Their brain does not think they are in the wrong body, they have been TAUGHT to think they are in the wrong body.  The vast majority are young women, going through puberty and struggling with body image due to society and how nasty kids are.  They don't like the changes and they are looking for answers.  Suddenly the media and all their authority figures are telling them "oh, you are in the wrong body, you are supposed to be a man"  and they are kids who are extremely impressionable and then they are given a complex.  There is a reason there has never been a massive epidemic of literal children believing they are in the wrong body at any time in history.  Because nobody told them they are were in the wrong body.</div>

"Tax cuts for the rich" is such a bogeyman statement that is constantly thrown around,  what were the actual tax cuts?  Not the 1 liner from CNN.   Increasing deficit is not the president, but congress.  Removing pandemic team is like, sure hindsight is 20/20.  Tried to overthrow the democratic process, now you are just taking the piss.   Secondly you're probably talking about comments on reddit, which is different from talking to a real person.  If you ask the question on Reddit they will quickly google what their group think response is supposed to be, which is probably what you just did.</div>

Now, I don't disagree with you, but I have been in arguments on reddit over this, and the leftists would hate you more for saying they have a mental disorder than for calling them transformers.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The funny thing is, if you ask anybody "why was Trump a bad president?"   or  "why was Trump a good president"  99.5% of them will not be able to give you an answer that actually involves his job as a president.  If they say he was a good president there answer will usually be along the lines of "I just like that he's not part of the political elite"  or "I just like that he says what he wants and won't be pushed around"  things to that effect.   If they say he was a bad president they will say things like "he's a horrible person,  he's constantly lying and talking shit to everybody,  he's not presidential".   Nobody will ever tell you "well these are the policies that he enacted that I liked or did not like"</div>
