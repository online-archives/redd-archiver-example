I saw a whole bunch of anti-Semites in Tennessee the other day.

Same kind that were in Wisconsin, a few months ago, and in Florida in the years before.

Were they all Muslim, too? It was all of the Muslims in Charlottesville, chanting "they will not replace us'"?

Anti-Semitic hate crimes are perpetuated in Europe and North America... largely by... Muslim populations? That's your take? It's all the Muslims causing that to happen? If we just... What... killed all of the Muslim communities around the world there would be no more anti-Semitism? Just gone from the face of the earth? All of it? Wow.

>What part are you confused of?

The part where that is not how genocide works, unless we can count the number of bullets fired per capita and use that to take everyone's guns away.

>Congratulations on also not answering anything about why somebody would peacekeep.

Gee, I have no fucking idea why countries would agree to mediate, versus allowing them to drag entire fucking continental regions into deep political unrest. No fucking clue. Remind me to keep you on speed dial the next time Germany gets uppity and says "we're just going to borrow Austria and Poland and these other countries for a bit". Why would anybody want to mediate that? Why would anybody want to mediate apartheid South Africa? Why would anybody want to mediate China / Taiwan? I dunno. Maybe I am just too soft and both sides should just be nuked off the planet, because Murica. Fuck Yeah!

>Instead of answering the question you pretended Israel was at fault and tried to redirect The topic unsuccessfully

I don't see what control the population of Palestine, currently cowering in the corner in Rafah has in the situation. Mind telling me how they are running the show?

>State who would do it and why. You trying to pretend the UN would actually be useful considering they've done nothing and have offered to do nothing to help Israel at any point in the past shows that they aren't a viable option.

Yes. 0 countries in the UN (how many is that, again?) have offered to provide support, under the banner of the UN. How many UN casualties have there been in Palestine, thus far? But no. Nobody with the UN has ever, never, never ever been anywhere near this conflict, ever.

> “‹The U.K. is considering a push to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations›, Foreign Secretary David Cameron said, as he tries to sell a plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza.”

Nobody is remotely considering getting involved... at all, in the least.

>You're saying that people are trying to kill brown people because they believe in a different God. The situation is the inverse. This is why people shouldn't form opinions on subjects they're uneducated on.

Jesus you are dumb. Profoundly dumb.

>Okay if Muslim being the state religion has nothing to do with authoritarianism fascism or otherwise, what percentage of Muslim countries give women and LGBT human rights?

What was the fucking state religion of Iran, in 1975?

https://www.npr.org/2012/02/16/146977562/foreign-policy-once-upon-a-time-in-tehran

What city is that? Where is that city? What is the fucking state religion?

Guess why I believe in separation of politics and religion. It's not because I believe that one day, Muslims might be elected. It's because I can't trust any right-wing authoritarian fuckers of any kind.

Turns out that Hitler was also bad for the Jews, and up until he started arresting the clergy, he was working with the Protestants as the official religion. Those Protestants must have been secretly Muslim, I guess.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>What do you mean prove?

Prove ***genocide***. Not "attacks", ***genocide***. That would be either the extermination of a people, the sterilization of a people, the subjugation and suppression of a people to the point of loss of culture and identity, or the removal and expungement of a people from their homeland. How far have Palestinian civilians gotten, there? In the complete decimation/sterilization/land-appropriation of Israel?

Those are the types of things that need to occur when using the word *genocide*, in the global forum. It's a higher bar than "firing rockets at", or it would be used all the damned time, in every damned conflict, every damned where.

>As for peacekeeping to mediate if that was an option why did nobody try to peacekeep or mediate the situation for well over 20 years?

Oh? It's been a lot longer than 20.

And I wonder why. Aren't there a *whole lot of countries saying Israel shouldn't start an incursion into Rafah*? Aren't there a whole bunch of Israelis calling for an end to the retaliation? What has the response been from Netanyahu? What would the response be from him if, oh, I dunno, there were calls to let peacekeepers in, to provide aid... or to deliver supplies and food... or to assess the situation? What would the response be, exactly?

>Who specifically would have done the peacekeeping?

Gee, I have never, ever seen a blue helmet, anywhere, in any part of the world, for any reason.

>You're worried about radicalizing people when you don't understand. The vast majority of Muslim countries are already radical. That's why women are property, can't get an education and can't vote. Everything you read about Christian extremist is generally baseline in these countries. They will stone LGBT people to death for existing. That's why all of your arguments come down to there should just be peace, and why you try to guilt me by saying I just want brown people to die. I've been a military intelligence analyst for almost a decade. This is the real world.

Ahh yes. The "brown people need to die, because it's not my preferred god".

And of course it's Muslims, just by virtue of being Muslim. Has nothing to do with authoritarianism or totalitarianism, or using fascist rhetoric to control the population. Yeah, pictures of Iran in 1970 compared to pictures of Iran in 1980... can't tell them apart at all. Not in the least. You are shit at your job if your analysis is fundamentally incapable of assessing what actually happens or why. Got some dumbfuck "it happens there because of Islam but it can't happen literally anywhere else because my book also says to stone people to death but we just fucking aren't yet, magically even if my god says so" logic, there. Yeah it has fundamentally nothing to do with the leaders or political/socioeconomic climate... yeah... Jesus Christ.

>The people made that decision

Use your big analyst brain. Which people. When. What year. What is the current demographic. Why did that decision get made. What factors led to it. C'mon. Big boy thoughts. Cause and effect... did they just wake up one day and say "right, today we are killing every Jewish person on the planet"? There are plenty of Jewish people in Canada. As well as Muslim people in Canada. Why haven't there been more murders of Jewish people? Why hasn't Montreal just become a smoking crater? Isn't it in their genes? Or their religion? Aren't they hard-wired to genocide all Jewish people? And yet, somehow, magically, bars, strip clubs, churches, synagogues, and mosques all magically coexist in Montreal. Is it the poutine? I mean, it's hard to keep poutine kosher, with how much better beef stock is on fries and in gravy, and while not haram, I doubt it's halal in the true spirit of the word... But it is fucking good. Maybe it's the poutine.

>Your suggesting the resolution that you want not the resolution they want.

Funny, I'm suggesting the solution that makes everybody safe, not the solution that makes anybody happy.</div>

Not other Muslims, specifically, how deep into the killing or expropriation of all Jewish land has Palestine gotten, exactly?

And what steps can be taken by Israel?

Deferring to a third party coalition force to do peacekeeping and management of the space between the two, and allowing aid into the region and letting people have regular lives.

It's not fucking hard.

Unless you genocide *all of the Muslim people there* do you think that killing women and children and infants isn't going to radicalize a whole bunch of people with nothing left to lose?

No, of course you haven't. You're either dense or just really want as many brown people to die as possible.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">...why don't the people who disappear in puffs of pink mist, in front of their children, prepare their children for success... gee, I dunno.

My gender non-presumed dude...

the argument, levied *constantly* is "they voted for their destruction".

In 2005. They voted for their destruction.

50% of people are not even 18. 40% are not even 15. Of the whole population.

The vote was 19 years ago. Do you know of any country that allows fetuses to vote? I don't. In fact, the voting age was 18.  
So now, 50% are not adults. And also, the people who *are* adults need to be 37 or older to even have been eligible.

Fun story, there's kind of an interesting missing demographic in Palestine, for one reason or another. Who knows. Same reason a bunch of kids are raised by their aunts or their grandparents, I guess... Perhaps it's a resurgence of spontaneous human combustion over the past many years?

So whatever you are imagining in the Leave it to Beaver "bootstraps" world you are imagining, it isn't that.</div>

Are. Children.

The median age is 18.

40% are 14.


There might have been more older people but they were already killed, long ago.
