    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I generally agree with your points.

1. It shouldn't be only on one group of people to propose solutions. The main problem that gun control advocates is that they do not hold gun rights activists accountable to propose solutions. The general blanket statement "we have a mental health problem in this country" is accurate but unrelated to the gun problem.  Generally speaking, in most civilized countries, a person who is wildly anti-government and hoarding guns and ammo would be deemed mentally unfit, and his weapons would be taken. In the US, this can't be considered mentally unfit, because it would sweep up hundreds or thousands of people. Likewise, people saying "this is a gang problem", are also just abdicating solutions. The simple fact is that every city in the country has an anti-gang unit, and despite massive investent, the police haven't stopped (only shrunk) gangs. Ultimately, there is a 1st amendment right to be in a gang, just like there is a 2nd amendment right to own a gun.  I am open to any solution that isn't systematically racist, and is legally enforceable, to curb gun violence. Nothing - no one thing - that any gun rights activist has proposed from "allowing God in schools" to "thoughts and prayers" has had any effect on gun violence rates. As long as the proposal is effective, legal, and not racist, let's hear those proposals. Of course, the guns right activists will never make those proposals, because they don't exist. 
2. No one is proposing mass confiscation.
3. See #2.
4. Agreed.

The solution that most people want, and most civilized countries have, isn't mass confiscation, it's just simply registration.

It's already illegal to transfer guns to ineligible people (minors, criminals, drug addicts, etc). This rule is unenforceable.

The answer is gun violence is simply to register guns, to a natural owner, from time of manufacture to the time of destruction. Once a year, the police come to inspect your gun collection, ensure you have them, that they are properly secured, and that's that. Gun sales or transfers are done by a FFL or at a police station, and that's that. If you are in possession of an unregistered gun, the gun is destroyed and you go to jail, lose your right to own guns when you get out.

That's it. Super simple. Everyone can still own hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo, as many guns as you want, all the types, etc.

And we can start going to parades again without worrying about getting shot in the fucking face for no good reason.

Gangs would be deeply impacted (but not eliminated) - the primary source of gang weapons (i.e. straw purchases) would dry up over night. We'd have as many or more guns owned than now, etc.

Before you complain about how easy would be for the government to do a mass confiscation if in the event of a tyrannical takeover, just remember: you yourself said there are just too many to do mass gun confiscation. 

Finally, regarding a "bulwark against tyranny". I think we can pretty much retire this concept as a useful argument. The government was about 90 minutes from being overthrown on January 6th. It wasn't citizens with guns that stopped the overthrow, it was 800 cops with guns and nightsticks and tazers and tear gas. When the moment of truth came, guns in the hands of citizens.. did nothing. Luckily, the police were just able to put down the rebellion before Congress was overthrown. It was pretty close. A few cops did heros work and protected Congress and the constitutional order from being destroyed. Pretty lucky. But in general it validates the idea that really the purpose of guns isn't to preserve the right of the people to reject a tyrannical government, but rather, to protect themselves from other citizens when the government fails to protect them. That is a much more real, present, and realistic threat, and one which guns are proven to be very useful: when the police are too busy or on soft-strike, your own firearm might be the only thing left for you to rely on. That is the right we should be laser focused on, not the unproven claim that personal firearms are a solution to government tyranny. That has proven to be a massive disaster, and just inspires more lawlessness.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is just totally false.

Do a thought experiment: do some countries have less gun crime than the US? Is that random luck, or the result of policy?

You are 100% correct that criminals don't follow the law. Agree totally. The two minors involved in this gun crime: they didn't follow the law.

The problem is that their were no other criminals made in the process of them obtaining guns: they were the only ones who had to break the law to get the guns they used for this shooting.

The entire chain of gun control from the source is loose in the US, and that's why people who criminally engage in shootings can always get guns.

It was legal for the gun store to sell the gun to a straw buyer, it was legal for that person to transfer the gun without records, it was legal for them not to report that the gun wasn't in their care. It was legal for the ammo to be sold to a straw buyer.

This isn't rocket science:

1. All gun transfers are reported to the ATF for central record keeping.
2. Every gun is registered to a natural person owner, or a government agency.
3. You receive a gun transfer, it's registered to you until it is destroyed by a gun dealer or the police, or you record a transfer to another party. Every year, your local police department comes to inspect your gun, ensure that it is locked up, safe, and accounted for.
4. If your local police can't inspect your gun, it is assumed you illegally transferred it, and you go to jail for 5 years.
5. If you are in possession of a gun that isn't registered to you, you go to jail for 5 years.

That's it. The US will go from a homocide rate in 4.x to 5.x per 100,000 rate, to under 1.x per 100,000 just like all the other civilized countries in the world.

Gun people can still have guns. You can still have a huge arsenal. You can still open-carry. You can still have all the 2A rights you have today.

And people can go to a parade without worrying about being shot in the fucking face.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">1. There are virtually no gun control laws whatsoever in effect in KC, and none that are actually enforced. There is no mechanism to prevent transfer of guns, no requirements for example for annual inspections, etc. 
2. The police have come out and confirmed no gang affiliations at all.

This is, as you, say, two random shits who knew each other beefing over disrespect. It escalated because one knew where the other was going to be (parade), they hard words, and it erupted into gunfire. This happens all the time. 

People such as yourself wish it was just as easy to write off most/virtually all gun violence as "gang related", like organized crime where one party ordered an attack on the other, but the actual on the ground reality is that this is self-organizing chaos that develops from small scale arguments.

KC has been a shit-hole for this type of thing for decades, and with the recent soft-police strike, there is virtually no enforcement whatsoever.

The actual number of gang members is much smaller than most people in the larger world think. The anti-gang taskforce in KC estimated there are about \~110-150 \*total\* gang members in the KC area. 

For sure they are involved in lots of crime, but no where near the number that people (such as yourself) push on them.

I.e. even in areas with no gang activity whatsoever, there's massive gun violence problems. A great example: Little Rock. One of the most dangerous cities in the country, literally no gangs. Kalamazoo, Michigan, a top 10 dangerous city in the US, no gangs. 

Passing the gun violence problem off on gangs is just not the case. Vast majority of  gun crimes are not mass shootings, and vast majority of  gun crimes are not gang related.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">We don't have a mental health problem. This shooting was facilitated because two different people had a run of the mill disagreement, and in the heat of the moment, they were able to escalate this run of the mill disagreement involving disrespect and whatever into a shooting match.

We are the only country in the world with that.

In KC, the rest of the story is:

* Police have been on soft-strike for a while because one of their officers was convicted and put in jail for shooting an unarmed minor in a botched home invasion raid.
* The state and local governments have all but given up trying to enforce drug laws, gun laws, and anything else. 
* Municipal government and police have been corrupt since the city was founded, and it's basically always been a lawless shithole.</div>
