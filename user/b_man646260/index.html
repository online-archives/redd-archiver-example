    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My main point is that the Supreme Court visited this issue in like 1940 and the ruling agreed with the interpretation that I agree with today. It stood for 70 years until gun lobby had an opening to sway the court in 2008. Look what happens to gun deaths after 2008, particularly suicide. I know correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, but there is a clear correlation. 

I just want to be clear in your argument. You really the framers really meant for guns to be as ubiquitous a part of our society as they are today? You really believe *this* was the vision of the founders? That’s fucking depressing.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Do you think I have the power to change the constitution? I’m flattered.

The intent, and what stood since its inception to 2008 is that the 2nd was written to ensure the federal gov could not infringe on States’ individual rights to defend themselves. They didn’t just write the whole first half of the amendment for no reason. The wording is specific and concise. The words “well-regulated militia” aren’t in there by mistake. In 2008 a conservative Supreme Court overturned the long standing precedent that did not view 2A as a mechanism to give every individual a right to keep and bear arms.  By a margin of 5-4, hardly a landslide and, with more recent info coming out about Clarence Thomas’ sketchy dealings with corporate lobbyists, was undoubtedly influenced by the gun lobby.  

The framers had it right in the first place. They didn’t mean that every single person should be able to go down to Walmart and pick up an AR-15 just for fun. Any reasonable person would come to that conclusion because it’s so fucking obvious. And it’s so obvious because not a day goes by that we’re not overwhelmed with stories of gun violence and innocent bloodshed. But, hey, at least you get to feel cool at the range with your buddies.  Totally worth it.</div>

Anyway, here I am in a bad faith goose chase like I said I wouldn’t do. Disengaging. If you think the 2nd was written so any old fuckhead on the street should have the inalienable right to be strapped with a high powered rifle, you can go fuck a gun. That’s as disingenuous as it gets. The bar needs to be higher. It could start by existing. Until then I’ll just hope my kids don’t get gunned down by one of your fellow enthusiasts. I will not reply after this.</div>

When it comes to tightening up regulations around firearms and enforcing laws that are already on the books, the 2A crowd is absolutely saying “do nothing.” It’s not just one way or the other. There are many factors and those factors include ease of access to deadly weapons, poor/no systems in place to dispossess known unstable/dangerous individuals of their guns, and addressing mental health on a mass scale. It’s not either/or. It’s all of it.</div>
