    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes it's easy. You look at the total number of attacks, and if they had hit how much of the population would have been devastated. If a majority of the population would have been devastated statistically you can prove they tried to genocide them. What part are you confused of?

Congratulations on also not answering anything about why somebody would peacekeep. Instead of answering the question you pretended Israel was at fault and tried to redirect The topic unsuccessfully. So I'll restate it again. Your solution was third party peacekeeping. State who would do it and why. You trying to pretend the UN would actually be useful considering they've done nothing and have offered to do nothing to help Israel at any point in the past shows that they aren't a viable option. Let's hear your next choice

Your little quip where you tried to turn it around is nonsensical. You're saying that people are trying to kill brown people because they believe in a different God. The situation is the inverse. This is why people shouldn't form opinions on subjects they're uneducated on.

Okay if Muslim being the state religion has nothing to do with authoritarianism fascism or otherwise, what percentage of Muslim countries give women and LGBT human rights?

As for your question of why it doesn't happen in other countries to Jewish people. It does you just didn't care enough to check. anti-Semitism has been on the rise globally. Another subject you're poorly educated on but still formed an opinion. The difference here is accessibility, they are closer to Israel so that's where they enact their anti-Semitic views. The people in the relevant countries you're talking about are the ones that perpetrate crime against Jewish people because of accessibility there. What other delusions can I shatter for you?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">What do you mean prove? The records of thousands of rockets striking iron dome is public knowledge you could literally Google that right now. The trajectory where they intersect the rockets shows its origin. It's not even possible to pretend otherwise.

As for peacekeeping to mediate if that was an option why did nobody try to peacekeep or mediate the situation for well over 20 years? It's almost like your idealistic views of the world don't apply and other countries don't volunteer to put their people in harm's Way regularly. Who specifically would have done the peacekeeping?

You're worried about radicalizing people when you don't understand. The vast majority of Muslim countries are already radical. That's why women are property, can't get an education and can't vote. Everything you read about Christian extremist is generally baseline in these countries. They will stone LGBT people to death for existing. That's why all of your arguments come down to there should just be peace, and why you try to guilt me by saying I just want brown people to die. I've been a military intelligence analyst for almost a decade. This is the real world. Idealic solutions don't happen just because you want them to. You do not understand the massive, and I cannot emphasize this more massive cultural differences between most countries especially in the Middle East. Radical terrorist group was already empowered. The people made that decision. And you're saying this retaliation for their actions will radicalize them? That boat sailed, completed its trip, return to port, and sailed again. 

You understand nothing of their culture religion the geopolitical region or their values. But you asserted your own privilege moral standings on other people, not understanding how vastly different All people are on earth. Your suggesting the resolution that you want not the resolution they want.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Weird unprompted gender comment aside, Even though this dates back to 2005 as the start point it's been 20 years. Thousands of rockets fired into Israel. Simply because of their ethnicity and religion. And yet nobody in Palestine has done anything to stop it. If Israel didn't have the power to protect itself everything that happened in Gaza would have happened to them 10 times over. The only reason you get to be on your moral high horse here is the fact that Israel had the iron dome to actually protect people. And even then despite the aggression they didn't invade until Hamas invaded their country, found out about a civilian gathering when they were already in there and went to massacre. If people of Palestine will not root out Hamas, then someone else has to. You cannot reasonably just expect them to tolerate this indefinitely. You're expecting them to tolerate whatever happens to them and not find a permanent solution. How do you justify that?</div>
