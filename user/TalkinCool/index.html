    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;What was your comment that triggered this?

I have no idea.  That's the point.  There is no link to anything.  I don't "harass" people.  I'm not a saint, but I follow the basic site-wide rules of not threatening people or singling them out for harassment.  I didn't do what I was accused of.  My accusers know I didn't, so they didn't link to or quote anything I supposedly did or said.

&gt;I ban people from here too and they go to subs to complain, but they never provide context.

This image is all the context I have.  Mysterious one-week ban with no evidence, no way to appeal it and no way to know what I did.  Admins are cancer.

&gt;Not saying you're doing this, but we are only seeing one side of the story.

Yeah, I'm only seeing one side of it too.  That's the point.  They gave me *nothing*.  Just a one week ban for who-knows-what.  I literally can't get admin to even respond to me to tell me how I broke any rule.  That's the whole point of this post.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;That was obviously an automated message and your response was not sent to anyone.

That's the point.  There's nobody to ask about the suspension.  This didn't used to be the case.  Admins treated redditors like people once upon a time.  My reply that you're smugly criticizing was simply meant to trigger the automatic "fuck you don't talk to us" message so the futility could be demonstrated.

&gt;What you need to do is to show what is on that page it linked before you can claim you got no reason.

The link goes to Reddit's ambiguous community guidelines page that says absolutely nothing about my own personal suspension.  It basically just says being offensive in any way can get you suspended or banned if they decide you deserve it.  It does not link to anything specific to a user's own suspension.

You walk on eggshells, be a good boy, behave, and stick to the good-for-brand narrative or you get silenced without a means for appeal or discussion.  You don't get to know what you did.  You're supposed to know.  Those who know how to follow the crowd and fit in get to stay, and will never receive messages like this.  It's clear you've never received one, so I'm guessing you're one of the type who subconsciously know how to avoid wrong-think.</div>
