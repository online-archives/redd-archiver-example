    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;Well he didn't do anything illegal, he's **just a bad person**. 

In that case I don't think anyone has the right to harass him. Because being a bad person is subjective.

&gt;Morality and Law are often in conflict. Laws shouldn't tell you right from wrong, laws are subject to change.

&gt;So I'll just settle for making him feel uncomfortable.

Laws are the rules by which our society works. These are the rules we all agreed to. I don't know the legal situation in the USA, but in my country it is illegal to harass others, for example. I don't think that any person has to right to make someone else uncomfortable.

&gt;Also I don't see him getting harassed out of an establishment to be justice.

It is. These people want to punish him because they dislike his behavior. Which is in my opinion very problematic.

&gt;directly responsible for American deaths through the spread of misinformation about Covid...

Hard disagree on that one. He is not to blame for the stupidity of other people. Everyone has access to the internet, and if people choose to believe in fake news it is their own fault. Here in Germany we don't have Alex Jones, but people still choose to believe random screenshots from Facebook.

That said I do think that this is a problem, but as long as it is legal I don't think it is right to individually punish people. Journalists, random people or entertainers should be allowed to spread false information.</div>

Well the things they say about him are pretty mean. I am normally not a big conspiracy guy but just read some of the stuff said about him.

This one person first calls him an "embarrassment" and then says this
