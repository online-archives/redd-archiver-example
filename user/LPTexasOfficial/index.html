    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">A license isn't required to own or operate a car. Neither is registration or insurance. A blind person can purchase a car and drive it on their property if they wanted to. Nothing prevents a person from buying and owning a vehicle. Nothing should prevent a person from buying or owning a weapon either. You're missing the entire point.

To your point even in constitutional carry states you cannot do anything you want with a gun. Murder and assault are already crimes. Threatening someone's life is already a crime.

Guns themselves are also heavily "regulated" with safety features and other specifications.

What's an even crazier point is that many areas with constitutional carry also have significantly less gun violence than other areas with a high amount of gun regulations. Almost as if it's not the guns.

Wanting to scrap the 2A... You need to seriously reevaluate your position on this. Many instances throughout history the government have taken away its people's guns only to commit mass amounts of violence against them afterwards. Then not to mention the times our own government has used weapons against us and sometimes if it weren't for the 2A those people would've been helpless. Like the Battle of Athens. If it weren't for the 2A those people would've been screwed by the government. Then you have the Indians... They were forced to give up their weapons and put them in camps where they attempted to reeducate them. Or how about the Kent State Massacre. The list goes on.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">We pointed this out before but the mods are mostly Mises yes... After pointing this out they made the mod list private... It's also easy to see that a lot of Republicans feel politically homeless right now and found a home in the LP so they still have some old habits that don't align fully with LP principles. Hopefully some of that will smooth out but we need principled LP folks to help with that.

We work with plenty of great Mises folks in LPTexas that are very much just trying to help the party and have done great work. We get the same issues with both the CLC and MC folks but plenty of rational people in both camps help us out greatly. We aren't trying to not mention other caucuses but just want to get our point across.

We got banned from there when we did this last but... If you don't like how things are going look into volunteering in your county, state, and etc. The LP could always use the help.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Same. This is the official account of the Libertarian Party of Texas. We got banned today and our post was removed for posting a quote picture from Milton Friedman (libertarian) on illegal immigration from Mexico:

"Look, for example, at the obvious, immediate, practical example of illegal Mexican immigration. Now, that Mexican immigration, over the border, is a good thing. It’s a good thing for the illegal immigrants. It’s a good thing for the United States. It’s a good thing for the citizens of the country. But, it’s only good so long as it’s illegal." - Milton Friedman (libertarian) quote we posted in meme format on r/libertarianmeme

From the LP.org platform:

3.4 Free Trade and Migration

We support the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. Political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries. Economic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human as well as financial capital across national borders.

Those subs are not run by the Libertarian Party or do their actions represent our principles.</div>

Cited rule #1 which means we were banned for being anti-libertarian...

The Libertarian Party does not run that subreddit.</div>
