    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>That we financed and helped.  
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957.amp

I read that link. And there's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the US financed. And do you know why the US helps democracies? Because it benefits the US goal of world peace. Because democracies as a whole are very unlikely to choose war willingly. 

I'm sure that statement is funny. Because you'll bring up Iraq and Afghanistan. But Afghanistan was in response to a terrorist attack. And then Iraq was a response to that same terrorist attack, who supposedly had WMD. Know we all know why that the Iraq reason was false. But I'm just explaining why Iraq was supported by the US people at the time. Afghanistan was a response to 9/11

>I’ve watched that “documentary” and it was fairly obvious it was propaganda. Just because you call something a “documentary” doesn’t mean it’s not tainted by bias or has certain info edited out. They completely ignored the role that neo Nazi groups played in the movement. 

This is so odd. I mean we have neo-nazis in our(I dont believe you are an American citizen but whatever) armed forces. I mean so what? It's also odd that Zelensky was voted in, by Eastern Ukraine. Which supposedly had the majority of neo-nazis. I mean kinda odd that your pushing that neo-nazi's where in Ukraine(they are also in the US). Controlling the maiden, and controlling the orange protests. And yet your whole point is neo-nazis are controlling Ukraine. What a weak argument. 

>The documentary also failed to include conversations between Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt (US state actors).

Which isn't as big of a deal as you think it is. I mean every nation tries to get people in charge who would be beneficial to their interests. That's EXACTLY what russia was doing to Ukraine prior to any color revolution. So what is your point? Seriously WHAT IS YOUR POINT?   


>https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-heartbreaking-irony-of-winter-on-fire/tnamp/  


Have you read this paper? I have. It's hugely speculative. And they even point it out that in the "Evidence and Research Methods". But it's hardly the slam dunk you think it is. And if you read the paper. It's pointing you in the direction of the conspiracy. By leading you to make these forced jumps. It's not the slam dunk you think it is. 

It's hilarious though. Because in that very paper, the US is all but staying out of an international investigation. And leaving it to the Ukrainian authorities. But russia is not. Why is russia allowed to interfere in a Ukrainian revolution, but the US and NATO isn't? 

Either way if you are an American citizen (you aren't) you have fallen to the propaganda of the enemy. And as you aren't, it's obvious that you're a ruski.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Our own nation was helped in our own revolutionary war. France, Spain and the Netherlands all came to our aid. It's ignoring our nation's founding to not continue helping nations. Get out of the shackles that is an autocratic nation such as russia. 

The US is not falling apart as you claim. I mean there's a lot to fix in our current system. But it has nothing to do with as you claim "sending billions of dollars to a corrupt shit hole in Eastern Europe". 

It's like the OP in the health care crisis. Did he vote for a party that refuses to even entertain a better system. Did he vote for a party that voted against any sort of single payer system. 

Also even, EVEN if this Ukraine war wasn't going on. You really think congress as it stands would have a chance of improving Healthcare, addiction, economic inequality. Hell we have a insane house speaker atm who won't even vote on the border bill. Because it MIGHT benefit Biden in the elections.

You're disingenuous and it really shows.</div>
