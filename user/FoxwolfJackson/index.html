That was the whole word-picture that Benito Mussolini used in one of his speeches promoting fascism.

That actually is kinda frightening to think about that I used the same kind of concept as Mussolini used. I just kinda thought about it, 'cause I have to drive over a suspension bridge every day for work and I think about how it's like metallic twine, and I think about how twince, while strong in the form it's sold, is just a bunch of weak strings put together, lol.

I forget the actual person, but Foamy the Squirrel quoted someone from history that once said that the very idea of shouting down anyone who disagrees with them as "intellectual fascism" and as someone who went to war to "fight actual fascism", it sent shivers down his spine to see the same concept of intolerance being fought mentally instead of physically.. or something to that extent.

To be fair, it's not just these people that act like this. It's hard to not say they're justified in how they act when you have people as... equal but opposite as them... in the MAGA Movement. They're two halves to the same coin.

... for a generation that grew up loving The Hunger Games (or perhaps most of them only saw the movies), they're doing a good job being representatives of President Snow and President Coin.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Sorry, but when the representative of modern feminism include Claudia Restrepo and Anita Sarkeesian, that's a VERY far cry from Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth. Have either of these ladies advocated for a harsh scrutiny of the court system and how unfair the laws are about custody of a child after separation/divorce? Have either of these ladies cared about how male suicide rate is higher? Do either of these "feminists" care that females still don't have to register for selective service?

Also, there is very much equality in the west. Not sure what inequalities there are left. Females can join the Army Rangers just as much as the men can, provided they pass the exam. The "wage gap" in virtually every field has been proven to be a debunked myth YEARS ago and the term only exists because of the uninformed perpetually peddling the propaganda. Females are slowly starting to play more football (IIRC: the NCAA has a few female kickers for their football teams, although I can't remember which ones they are off the top of my head).

I *am* a feminist, but I am a real feminist... not an insult to the movement like those two, and everyone on social media who acts like them, are.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I mean, when one of the most famous examples of modern feminism is the "Video Games Appeal to the Male Fantasy" meme and most modern so-called "feminists" believe that kind of thing, then yes, I do believe they are not being fair or equalist about things.

When was the last time you heard a story of a modern feminist, particularly the ones with a bunch of clout on TikTok, actively take a stand against the unfairness of the custodial system of courts? If the two genders are so equal, why must the male be the one who pays alimony in every instance where the two sides are financially equal? Why must the child automatically go to the mother in every instance where the two sides are equal?

Why is it that most feminists don't push the cruel narrative that the male suicide rate is FAR higher than female suicide rates and try to do more about it?

It's because they don't care.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I've oftentimes said that a LOT of good social movements with honestly good intentions are always taken over by bullies looking for a way to be themselves without judgment. I've been called a "transphobe" because I called a trans person out on their bullshit and, instead of being accountable that they stole something, they just said "you only blamed me because I'm trans". God, I hate people who use things like that or mental health or anything else as an armor to be a shitty person...

People who call themselves "feminists", people who call themselves "allies" to the LGBT... some of these people are the worst, because all they do is yell and scream and attack anyone who disagrees with them... and the reason they do it is because they have no idea what they actually stand for. They're just a wolf in sheep's clothing who, when you ask about the sheep's history and stance, they just yell "bigot".

I am a feminist (by classical definition). I am an ally. But, I will *not* engage in such activity. That's how you get someone on the fence to become an enemy. The victims these "allies" bully will always turn against us. We have to fight hate with love... and actual love, not the "love" and "tolerance" that social media people pretend to have, all the while intolerantly lynching anyone who's different from them. That makes them no better than racists and homophobes and transphobes themselves.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>Cripes! I gently disagree with the premise you opposed, in so far that I don't think equality is preferable, but rather that some form of "complementarianism" would be better suited to the roles of men and women.

I believe there's a famous speaker who mentioned that there's two types of equality in the world, traditional equality and cosmic equality (that is more commonly known as equity). Personally, in an ideal world, I would agree with you, but I also realize that the world is not ideal so long as humans continue to exist and corrupt any ideal system out there. You would have so many loud shouting matches about the roles of the genders to the point we would revert back to "patriarchy" screaming matches.  


>That is to say, one who cannot allow their own presumptions be tested in the heat of conversation and vigorous debate, will be unable to withstand a gentle breeze. Weak ideas lead to weak people banning strong voices. When strong voices go, weak people corrode weak ideas into false premise and failed ideals.

A single thin strand of metal is weak, but twisted together, they form the cables that help hold up suspension bridges. You get enough weak ideas banded together and you end up with a strong movement that's able to stand up to strong ideas (especially when the premise of those strong ideas are unappealing, so many reject them and, therefore do not have many banded together to support it).

That's how I see a lot of social media. A bunch of weak ideas repeated over and over, strengthened with each repetition and new person flocking in.. until the illusion of strength is perceived. But, like the house of cards analogy in My Cousin Vinny, those building blocks are not bricks... just paper thin cards turned at an angle to show stability and strength.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh, yeah, I've long since accepted that every place is a groupthink curtailed by its mods. I more just posted this to get it out of my system. It's sad to see how these echo chambers (admittedly on both sides, not just the left) make people believe they are right and the world should all agree with them and when they get in real life and people disagree, they screech insults.

I remember on YouTube, someone mentioned "Death by Glamour is not the best song of Undertale and I'm tired of pretending it is" and the comment section was basically "dude, me too, I just never wanted to say it because I was afraid of getting bashed" or "dude, I thought so too, but I always believed if you disagree with someone, just shut up and move on".

Opposition being silenced has really given people such skewed views on the world. :/

I've said many times that the internet and social media was basically "the awkward kids who sat in a corner finding solace with each other while the rest of society marches on" and, with every passing year, I stand firmer on that opinion.</div>
