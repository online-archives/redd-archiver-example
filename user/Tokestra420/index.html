I have a kid, so I'm not an incel. And I'm only an edgelord if you're so boring that you think any of what I said was edgy.

            Comment on: <a href="../../r/RedditCensors/comments/9js4j2/rcringeanarchy_has_been_quarantined_i_cant_access/#comment-e6tvkvx">/r/CringeAnarchy has been quarantined. I can&#39;t access it from either of my mobile apps. I also can&#39;t access it on my phone&#39;s web browser unless I&#39;m signed in to my reddit account. When signed out, the page simply says the sub doesn&#39;t exist. Absolutely disgusting censorship from the Reddit admins.</a>
