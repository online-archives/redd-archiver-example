    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The worst part here is, this guy could still be alive if people just let men have places online to speak to one another without feeling the need to shut them down.

The amount of young men heading down dubious paths who could be corrected by guidance from other men who took the same turns if they were just free to speak to one another would have a massive effect on the lives of these young men.

The opponents to this are a perfect storm: International politics, foreign nations couldn't receive a greater gift than their rival nation's men crumbling. Rad fem takes naive boys and poisons them from youth, by demanding so much obeisance and fealty that they emasculate themselves preemptively thus destroying their ability to practice valuable social skills to increase their own ability or estimations of themselves by way of self elimination in the sexual market place. Most socialist ideation demands commiseration so they must treat independent men badly, blaming them for all things to drag them down and ward away prospects of self improvement for men who are struggling. biological tendencies for women to invade male spaces to shut down male stratagems for improving their sexual marketplace value and calling any attempts at self improvement, humor, fun, joy, or gaining peer recognition as "toxic" unless it is in itself a prostration to feminist deism. Pornographers, nanny state leftists who want broken homes, and the foolish traditionalists demanding men play by the rules of chivalry in our day and age expecting the practice of self denialism and deprecating self estimations. The worst advice echoed by all, is: "just be yourself" the reality is that being yourself only works if you are a chad, it's only good advice for boys under 9 so they can learn where they are in the pecking order.

The list of odd and convenient bed follows just gets longer and longer, certainly the  origin points are where this corruption on our civilizations spews forth and it's why the new reactionary right holds the animosities it does, these men know they were sabotaged and they aim to destroy the saboteurs, usurpers and interlopers; they being feminism, zionism, communism, the practice of living one's sexuality as a political orientation(whore culture), the pornographers, especially those with racial and political motivations, Islamism, economic migration by function of national and ethnic displacement, especially those funding western genocide via displacement consumerism, food and chemical industries which seem to be under a specific people's spell or their own protection but have hormonal poisoned the men on our planet with xenoestrogens and dietary misinformation.

There exist traps to harm and destroy men and boys around every corner, and the last acceptable thing for those who have laid such traps, is allow the men who have been struck by them to warn the others. Harm is their goal; thus they are your enemies.</div>

Why the sub was banned for that doesn't quite make any sense, I assume the sub was probably being run by people reddit didn't like.

The sub was banned for a single infraction of a single user while gonewild was not.

reddit is fucking awful.</div>
