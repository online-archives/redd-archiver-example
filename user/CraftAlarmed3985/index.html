    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Ukraine is nearly 5,000 miles from Washington DC, across the Atlantic, and nearly across another continent. It's historically Russian, was part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, has almost no ties to the West, is almost entirely interior, and other than being next to Russia, has no strategic value to us. 

The idea that we need to somehow forcefully address Russian aggression is equally ludicrous. Russia isn't even close to a threat. The Russian economy is less than $2T in GDP, the EU is 20. Between the US and the EU our economies are more than 20x the size of Russia. Russia has 120 million citizens and NATO has nearly a billion. 

This is a fucking border war that we stuck our noses into because what the fuck does anyone in DC have to do if they ain't killing someone?</div>

Also You.

Usually when someone starts threatening you with their imaginary internet friends, it's from their moms basement.

>The parallel with what you’re describing and appeasement should concern you. 

That's not a parallel and it shouldn't concern us because Ukraine has nothing to do with our interest.

They can do whatever they want without my money.

Oh my country hasn't been torn to shreds and hundreds of thousands of my countrymen killed in a useless war to support NATO expansion! I'm SOOO ANGRY!</div>

We could end the war in Ukraine tomorrow if we wanted to. We won't, because it keeps Russia bogged down. Your Ukrainian "friends" are dying (or maybe some shmucks they drafted are dying, idk?) so we can slowly bleed the Russians in a war that they can't pull out of, and we are feeding Ukraine just enough to hang on.</div>

I think if 80 years ago a couple million people rolled through your western frontier and murdered like 27 million of your countrymen you might be a little skittish about who your neighbors are.</div>

That def explains why Soros backed tons of lefty prosecutors, why Bezos bought the WaPo, why Bloomberg is constantly assaulting the conservative right, why Facebook is pumping millions into "election integrity",  why the vast majority of wealthy people vote Democrat, why the Ivy League is hard left, and why the wealthiest counties in the country are all HARD DEMOCRAT districts. 

It must be because all those rich and powerful people want to pay more in taxes.

There are enough challenges in life that all we need to do is not baby people along. We see this constantly in the education system where we continually infantalize even adults. We have no definition for what being an adult means today or any expectations for it. 

And being abused doesn't make you hard either. It often makes people weaker and more fucked up. It's the opposite of raising people to accept challenge and responsibility.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Look man, the mental health industry is like the education industry, its extremely left-wing and very feminine. I don't think these work for men. I think that traditional education as constructed by women has been completely disastrous for men's mental health. Feminizing men has not been good for their wellbeing, and continuing to run in that direction is even worse. I don't think most men are doing poorly because they are bottling up their feelings, but because they have to exist in a society that only puts weight on emotionality. 

I was in HS way over a decade ago and even then my mental health was horrible. It was really a suffocating environment where masculine interest were not valued or entertained, and where young men had to predominatly take their social queues from finger-wagging middle-nannies as opposed to any traditionally male role-models. 

My mental health improved rapidly when I left and joined Marine Corps and, later, wildland firefighting. Challenge, adversity, risk-taking, adventure, responsibility, these are things that men need to adopt a healthy mental attitude. They aren't going to find mental wellbeing in a shrinks office, they are going to find it in the struggle to accomplish something. 

I'm back in school now and I'm surrounded by miserable people and they are miserable because they are weak, and they are weak because no one has ever conditioned them. 

It's like the difference between the runner's high an experienced runner gets during a marathon, and the absolute misery of running your first mile as an untrained couch potato. Except in life we all have to run occasionally in a metaphorical sense. You can be well-trained and thrive on the challenge or you can approach every milestone as a misery that must be slogged through before you can go back to doing nothing.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">A lot of childhood "mental health" is built on pathologizing normal male behavior and instilling destructive values into men. 

Women need to feel intrinsic self worth. 

Men need to earn their self worth. Men cannot simply tell themselves that they are worthy, that just doesn't work. Men need to be given the opportunity to demonstrate to themselves and to others that they can live the values that Men instinctively respect in others.

So long as Men today stay fat, single, addicted to porn, and wasting their lives on video games, they won't feel esteem.</div>
