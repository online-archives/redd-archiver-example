That's a weird position to put forward that doesn't really connect with reality, but okay. If you say so. 

I mean, we do have credible investigations by the FBI starting in the late 1990's of White Nationalist groups infiltrating police forces across the nation. 

If you spend time in areas where rural meet exurb/suburban, in a good deal of the Midwest, there's an awful lot of a certain sentiment going on. 

In SE Michigan there are several cities with police forces that seem to have "Driving While Black" as the reason to pull someone over and always two to three police cruisers will show up, pretty quick. It happens often enough that there's been multiple lawsuits and "promises" to do some diversity and other training, but then it pops back up six months or so later.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Is it really hard to believe that organized groups would build uniforms for the group that expect all members to purchase or group purchase all of the same gear/kit? 

There's non-government organizations all over the US that has built their "Uniforms" going back hundreds of years. 

The Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, various Service Organizations, like the Shriners, The Masons.

New York City had the Guardian Angels in the 1970s.

The Black Panther Party had their own uniform of sorts. 

Plus... sketchy groups like the Proud Boys (They created uniforms and started requiring members to wear those at events.). Ever heard of the KKK? They have robes that are uniform. 

The German American Bund Party in the late 1920's through the start of the US actively being involved in WWII wore American Nazi Uniforms, that were QUITE close to what was worn by German Nazis, in Europe. 

Why is it hard to believe that a group of like minded people would want to put on a show of force and solidarity by wearing the same kit/equipment/uniform?</div>

You might want to read about these guys sometime:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_American\_Bund#:\~:text=The%20German%20American%20Bund%2C%20or,FONG%2C%20FDND%20in%20German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_American_Bund#:~:text=The%20German%20American%20Bund%2C%20or,FONG%2C%20FDND%20in%20German)).

Also, many of them were involved in multiple conspiracies to overthrow the US Government in the 1930's, leading up to our actively declaring war on Japan and Nazi Germany, involvement in World War II. 

They didn't evaporate or disappear after the war. They went underground, as it was not very bright to bring all that back up and out, after the US just beat the snot out of Nazi Germany.</div>

Where? I'd like to know where that would happen.   


Since the 1990's White Nationalists have been infiltrating police forces across the nation. So many police in so many organizations are already "Nazis". Why would they work to get one another fired?</div>

Weren't you aware that since the mid to late 1990's, White Supremacist groups, including the KKK, Neo-Nazis and many others, have been coordinating efforts to infiltrate police forces across the US? The FBI was investigating this in the lead up to the transfer of power from the Clinton to the Bush Administration.  


Bush the Younger closed the investigation.  


Hence, the infiltration of police with White Nationalists have continued unabated since the 1990's.   


Meaning, why yes... some of those roided out Nazis, could also be cops.   


[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/fbi-white-supremacists-in-law-enforcement)  


It's an easily located story.   


Not all White Supremacists are out of shape. SOME of those who work (police) forces, are (in fact) the same who burn crosses.</div>
