I'm happy i gave you a good laugh mate :b

I'm linking you in this comment chain if you'd want to read my reply to intolerance here, as it is pretty length.

You gotta believe what you gotta believe bro. Politics aside.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">But what should he do, then? 

I mean, in his weekly address Donald Trump explicitly said the saudis were showing more interest in irradicating extremism and terrorism. That's why he went.

Would you prefer him to absolutely ignore attempts of redemption and tolerance so you could have more leverage with your agenda?

What exactly do you want? To be right or for the right things to be made?

Because that is what has been driving Donald Trump since way back before even considering politics: a high sense of Beauty and morals. For example, stating in twitter way back that the high level pedophiles would pay for it one day.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I never understood this argument. Ever.

Dont you think that maybe you are just not fulfilled enough to be more rigid and disciplined and understand the Beauty behind t_d politics?

Because honestly I come up to realize that most of the people that criticize t_d are just blatantly frustrated and naive. They equal harshness to intolerance, and that's not the same. Just a weak perspective on life.

T_d was never racist. However it is based on non explicit kindness, thats what makes it more genuine.

We never gave a fuck about Race or religion. However, if the high representation of a religion tortures women, that's a problem.

Whether you like it or not, Donald Trump has photos of him handshaking and hugging Black people back when doing so really could be a problem.

Donald Trump payed for the rent of Black people in need back before he even considered getting to polítics.

Why didnt he bring it up on his campaign then?

Because he understands what it means to be happy and fortunate. He sees the Beauty past the race or gender since ever. It has been his status quo since he was thought the world revolved around money.

Back on campaign, there was a thread in reddit /r/all that was protrump with 55k upvotes i think. MSM asked trump with bathroom a trans should use and his response was extraordinary "i don't really know. I don't really care".

You see, this is the point where life can get simply unfair. I don't know anything about you or you about me but our Minds are deeply Rooted in a way of thinking that makes us the most comfortable throughout the day.

Maybe I can use the n word countless Times with my Black friends and everyone laughs it off because we all know se deeply love each other. We focus on the Beauty past those things: times shared, the look on our girlfriends eyes, everything beautiful really.

We are too alive to be politically correct. We believe in sensation, in emotion, not nuances from vocabulary or agendas.

Curiously, we are all kinda on the attractive side and have good jobs in thrilling fields. We even Spin a business with investiments on the side so we can enjoy an adventure all together as FAM.

As so, don't you think that maybe t_d is just a sense of unfrustrated purity in a rather Bland world where just words begin to hurt so more frustrated people may feel they have a role in others life, if they can't have on theirs?

I don't know, dude...</div>

1 Spez is liberal.

2 T_d was just a sub.

3 Donald Trump is ♨

4 Sub gains a lot of traction

5 Spez does not like (see 1)

6 Spez attacks t_d in multiple ways (changing comments included, filtering from all)

7 the mods, rightfully, do not take it 😚</div>
