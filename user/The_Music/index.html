    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Applause to you, man! From a liberal! Folk like you are trying to keep the aisle 'undivided'.

It's really rare when I can say that I wholly agree with the values you've presented, despite your status as a T_D supporter. Though I have to admit, I do not fit into the typical stereotypical "liberal" position. I do hold *some* conservative views.

I wish more people could see things as you and I do. Personally, I do not believe taxing those in the (I shift here) 80-100k range unduly is fair, though I must say 200k and above, there is no reason that I can find that would exempt them from more taxable contributions than the poorer. I say this as someone who grew up, and is currently (and fervently trying to escape) the sub 50k earning range.

&gt; get good people good jobs

I couldn't agree more. I know we have a lot of issues, and I know we will never EVER settle them. But it's times like these we have to take what we can get. If for one moment, we can hold our WWI-esque Christmas Truce, then I am satisfied that the upper echelon have retained their humanity.

Climate change, unfortunately, I can not budge on. It's an inevitable, horrific truth that will only worsen in my worldview. Terrorism from ISIS, in my eyes, is a result of our actions from pre-9/11 times and onward. Karma, one might say but I believe military action is the only way to vanquish it; again, here I depart from the typical liberal narrative.

Seriously, I wish more were as well-reasoned as you. Unfortunately, I view our president as a buffoon and a traitor, bur your views and those who see things as you do: I see that. I respect those beliefs even if I cannot bring myself to ascribe to them myself.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I get the sentiment. But you have to admit, you guys must feel more represented than us. For a majority of us democrats and liberals, our representatives won't even hold townhalls anymore, citing 'violent liberals'. 

No constituents ought to feel ignored by their government. It's how uprisings start. A lot of folks say it will never happen, especially from liberals. But if you push someone enough, they'll do what it takes. The one thing democrats had that republicans didn't was that they towed the line between both parties, and were too afraid to outright alienate the right. Trump/GOP has no problem alienating the center-left/far left and I fear for their well-being should good sense not prevail.

Alls well that ends well, best of luck to you and yours, mate. Welcome to the new administration, same as the old administration is how the saying goes, I believe.</div>

I appreciate your honesty, most of your side isn't willing to admit to any sort of fault, whether it's yours or just that of your party. Mine either for that matter...

My concern with t_d is when they over extend themselves into more serious, curated subreddits like /r/conservative. Memes and hyperbole have a place but not outside their subs, left or right </div>
