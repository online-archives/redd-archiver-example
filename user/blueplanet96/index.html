This is exactly what I’m talking about when it comes to not being able to hold anti war opinions on Reddit. We get insane neocon/neolibs like yourself that think we’re “aiding the enemy.” I’m not going to support this war and I will not support this war with the lives of our own troops.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>Because it was not a neo-nazi uprising.

Nobody claimed that. My question was why did they omit that info from the documentary? It is a fact that they were participants in Maidan, and excluding that information is dishonest for the sake of transparency and the historical record. The reason that information is important is because it shows that things weren’t nearly as black and white as the director of Winter On Fire tried to portray it as. You’re being intellectually dishonest by defending that omission. 

>You haven’t even responded to most of my original reply

I did. I think all you’re doing is regurgitating state department propaganda. You don’t like it, but I did respond to your reply about “security” and “economic interests.” I think it’s a load of neocon/neolib bullshit that DC insiders/hacks tell themselves so they can ignore the economic and social decay inside our own country. I as an American don’t stand to gain anything from this conflict, but defense contractors do. This is just a perpetuation of the military industrial complex and it having to make justifications for its continued existence. We can fund billions for a conflict that most Americans aren’t impacted by in anyway, but somehow we can’t invest the same amount of money on our overburdened southern border. 

Ukraine isn’t a NATO member. Ukraine is an insanely corrupt country where human trafficking has been rampant for years and currently is an area of the world where a lot of international arms dealing is going on. 

Fuck off with your “security” and “economic interests” arguments because I’m not buying it. I think that’s a cop out for continuing hawkish foreign policy goals. It damn sure isn’t doing anything for me.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">>The fact that there are neo-Nazis in Ukraine and those neo-nazis participated in euro maidan does not mean it was not a popular uprising…

So why did the director of Winter On Fire omit their involvement? You can’t call the documentary objective if it omits key facts that contributed to maidan itself. It’s incredibly deceptive to international audiences by excluding any information regarding their involvement in what happened with Maidan. The only reason to exclude key points of information like that is if you think the info is damaging to the central theme and message of the documentary itself. People should have that information because it gives a more complete and honest picture of what was going on and who the important groups/actors were. 

What exactly would you call a film that deliberately leaves out key facts about unrest and armed resistance in a country? If you’re honest, you’d call it propaganda because in any other context that’s what it would be. 

>What is the other side?

Half the country was split on maidan. Not every Ukrainian agreed with their goals or what they wanted. 

I’m not reciting Russian propaganda; these are facts that you’re attempting to hand wave away because they’re politically inconvenient to the lore behind Ukraine over the last 10 years.</div>

That we financed and helped.

>I strongly suggest you watch the documentary titled “Winter On Fire”

I’ve watched that “documentary” and it was fairly obvious it was propaganda. Just because you call something a “documentary” doesn’t mean it’s not tainted by bias or has certain info edited out. They completely ignored the role that neo Nazi groups played in the movement. The documentary also failed to include conversations between Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt (US state actors). 

The director of Winter On Fire even admitted to glossing over the involvement of actual far right neo Nazi groups. That documentary presents an entirely one sided view of Maidan and excludes certain key facts that are politically inconvenient.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The government should never be in the business of deciding what truth is. Who’s “misinformation?” At one point the government were pressuring social media corporations to censor people discussing the lab leak theory as “conspiracy.” 

I’m sorry but no matter how you slice it this is a gross overreach of government power. You’re justifying it because you agree with their reasoning for doing it, but it’s still censorship and it’s still wrong. The government has been less than honest throughout the pandemic about multiple things. 

“Misinformation” is code for things that some people don’t like and they think should be censored.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Except under section 230 of the communications act it makes it pretty clear that platforms like Reddit can’t have it both ways. They can either be a platform that allows people to share their own opinions and viewpoints; or they can be a publisher that specifically curates content that people can see. 

Plus we know for a fact that a lot of the censorship going on with social media platforms has absolutely been directed by pressure from the federal government. The government is using these companies as a proxy to get around the 1A, they are absolutely limiting our freedom of speech.</div>
