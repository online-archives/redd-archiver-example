    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The interesting thing is it's getting that way with more simple wireless broadband now as well, because broadband companies are refusing to upgrade their infrastructure and consistently screw over their customers with shoddy connections and wired broadband that isn't even worth it all forms of wireless internet are just going to bankrupt them when wireless gets rolled out more and the only thing really stopping them is getting the satellites and masts setup. I mean I've been looking into it for when I move out and just the fact that I can order a modem and have it arrive the next day without having to wait weeks for some fucking technician to come over and poke some cables in the house is already a huge plus.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's not necessarily a bad thing though, as CPUs have become so powerful now they can run most games on low end graphics fairly comfortably manufacturers now have a proof of concept for consumers to play around with and if you're just looking to make tiny PCs without having to stuff in a chunky graphics card that's fantastic. This also means that graphics card manufacturers can focus on making better mid-tier or higher graphics card than constantly churning out dirt cheap low end card that I'm sceptical of how many people buy anyway. In my view at least this is one of those moments where I'm very glad they're going to be potentially making that sort of thing obsolete. It seems that a lot of PC component manufacturing now is revolving around making parts as small and efficient as possible and I love that, see the evolution of SSDs as an example where they're continually moving away from idiotically large and chunky designs to making 1tb - 2tb hard drives that are the size of a RAM stick. I've already been pretty amazed at how cheap and tiny a low end raspberry pi is, these kind of PCs might end up being better options than laptops because of customisability.</div>

The problem then comes though where you're spending several hours explaining the difference between 'real' AI versus machine learning versus as you point out a fingerprint scanner, people just don't understand it so they just jump to conclusions all on their own and won't listen to the people who do.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The problem is the moment the AI encounters something on the road that a programmer didn't account for that means there's going to be an even worse disaster than if it were a human because AI simply aren't adaptable because it's just a string of code. This is what most people don't understand about AI programming generally, take for example the fact that a tesla car couldn't see a white lorry I believe it was coming straight at it, it's because tesla hadn't accounted for something like that or the technology hadn't been tested in that area. 

How many more gaps are there? You're not taking this into account when dealing with the issue of AI in the slightest and the annoying thing for me as a programmer it's way more difficult to explain this concept to a normie who's convinced AI is going to take over the world. AI is extremely efficient at doing predictable tasks, not ones where things can change constantly with unexpected variables.</div>

They should be used for automated factories and very sparingly for autonomous vehicles at most, never a complete abandonment by a human being and if they lose their signal or an error pops up they should just immediately shut down not start wondering off on their own. The modern AI is really just a set of numbers and a computer at best and still incredibly stupid if they encounter something unexpected.</div>

I am extremely wary though because I do not like the idea of them targeting people with real problems but this is how they do things especially on reddit. It's easy for us to shrug and go yeah that's why we don't use these sites but other people aren't going to be as informed as we are about their inner workings and they're the ones you have to worry about that might end up blowing up somewhere or killing somebody over this shit and the leftists know it.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh I just thought of something, what about a VPN? Would you be able to set up a localhost and then have people connect to you through a VPN rather than direct to your IP address? That might be an even better option. I could just use a random UK server then and have that as the place for people to connect to without any limits and still use my PC for hosting. Or would that not be possible as the engine would just blindly connect to the server and not go through to me the local host?

Edit: This may be engine specific so I'll have to probably ask on their forums.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Hmm, well this is why I'm considering building a second mini-itx PC that I can easily wipe and mess with whenever or use for travelling, thanks for the extra information I don't know enough about this so any resources and tutorials etc. you can throw my way is appreciated. What I'm thinking of setting up is just some kind of really small 4 player game on Godot or something just to get started and then have people connect, if I'm streaming for example I don't want people to be able grab my video off replays etc. and then start attacking my PC through the I.P address.  It's tricky, I'll have to keep poking around and see what I can find. I want to make it peer to peer because then I don't have to worry about hosting options and neither will anyone else, they can just fire up a server when they want even if the game is dead, I plan on adding peer to peer as an option for when my main game project is able to do multiplayer too. So you'll have the standards matchmaking but if that goes down you've still got peer to peer hosting which should future proof it, this will be on Unity though but that's a whole other thing I'm thinking about for the future.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">After doing some research I may have found the answer and it looks like Hamachi is going to be the best option for small scale testing at the moment weirdly.  Then if I'm looking to scale up I can look at more professional hosting methods etc.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Hmmm, problem is latency issues as described in the thread, I'm mainly thinking about just keeping the I.P address hidden, I wonder if there's a way to hide your I.P address while still displaying a button to connect, this is a tricky one. I've been looking at static I.P addresses for example and that's promising it's just I'm being a total cheapskate and I'm not sure I want to pay monthly or anything for something I'll barely use.

I would have thought there would be some kind of proxy server available? have the person connect to that and then the proxy server would direct the person to my PC for example, that's the main thing I'm thinking of right now.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I earnestly tried Linux mint one time, I'm going to have to study up on VirtualMachines now which is a pain depending on how intrusive the Windows 11 update is, I'll see how it goes but this is going to be a shitshow I think most people can already tell. I was playing Battlefield 1 and even in the chat they had started talking about it lol.

Thing that got to me as well is I tried getting Unity to run on Linux mint and it was such a frustrating pain in the arse, I need that for my work, not only was I having problems running my HDRP project, microsoft visual studio was borked too so now I have to research an alternative for linux just in case apofdpofkappfdapkpdoa. The only alternative if things get really bad for me is I'm going to have to import my entire project to Godot and I am NOT looking forward to that possibility, fucking microsoft trying to break shit.

I was planning on getting more storage space anyway but I suspect I'll have to account for the shit that a VM takes up just installing the pretend version of windows, what a gigantic pain in the arse, this is why I'm thinking of just doing a second mini-ITX linux build because then I can have one running windows and one running Linux without messing around with software constantly.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I wonder if there's a way to block auto-update at this point entirely to prevent it from installing anything, because this is going to be cancer, I'm going to be keeping a close eye on this. It will be ridiculous, I don't want to have to switch to Linux if I can help it with the compatibility issues especially with regards to my work but microsoft may leave us all with no choice if we have to connect to a Microsoft account of all things. Although then again, what's to stop us all from just making throwaway accounts to get around the problem? It seems pretty daft.</div>

Now normally I wouldn't put much stock in the bitching of a bitter ex-partner but if she is to be believed the reason I think this might be the case is apparently he did the billionaire playboy thing quite a bit and like others I agree this is probably going to be his latest plaything. No coincidence as well that he's buying up tons of farmland and suddenly decided to start this very self-sustaining yacht project.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">He's stumbled on the stupid keyword algorithm gravy train, that's why they're mad at him. I think as well given exactly what pops up and what is being advertised there are brands involved in this for sure, you look up generic terms like 'free online dating' for example and it's all the same shit. You have articles that aren't necessarily generated but they're utter gibberish that have clearly been spammed to the top of google search to make sure you only see certain brand websites like match and okcupid. It's an absolute cancer and it doesn't even have to be about political leanings because it can get in the way of you searching for really basic things as well.

As another example with regards to my work when I looked for software alternatives to the industry standards if you but 'free' software in and so on it's just crap advertisement, but you put in open source then it gives you better results generally because there don't seem to be big brands or whatever making money off the clicks. This shit is everywhere and I wouldn't be surprised if at some point it all comes tumbling down, possibly due to all these scummy companies getting sued by advertisers who finally crunch the numbers and realise what's going on.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Nope, I've tried it believe me, twice, the database is a lie, you can 'technically' get it all working if you try enough don't get me wrong, but the frustration and misery just isn't worth it. What would be fantastic if there was some way to just get around most of the bullshit, these solutions Linux offers just isn't friendly to the end user if they're new at all. The final straw for me was not only that visual studio wasn't properly supported which I need for my work and then to add insult to injury when I tried going back and using their 'built in' USB image writer software it corrupted my windows 10 install. If I hadn't happened to have other PCs in the house I'd be fucked.

This is something that Linux users need to get serious about reconciling when it comes to new user that are earnest about ditching Microsoft. I love open source software and use it as often as I can, I'm currently using for my game development nothing but open source stuff for my asset creation, I'm on unity for now but I'm learning Godot and will be doing my later titles on that. I'm sorry to say though so far every version of Linux I have tried is absolute cancer. When developers properly support the software it works fantastic and exactly like you'd expect it to but all these work around are just going to piss off new users and make them retreat back to Windows. I shouldn't have to make a ritual sacrifice with a newborn baby just to get my favourite games working. Part of my problem is I've grown to hate steam so I avoid it now as much as possible, ironically despite Linux being open source and windows being the exact opposite I've found it easier to use windows to get around all the bullshit of software developers than I have with Linux.

Nothing compares to how nice it feels to double click an .exe file and have it all work exactly as you'd expect it to, a lot of Linux users just don't seem to understand how unpleasant it is making the switch and having to deal with all of that crap.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I would go even more basic than what people are recommending if you're starting off from scratch because if you don't even understand the vocabulary you won't know half the shit people are talking about on programming forums which are often a great source of information. I recommend picking up some programming glossaries since we're talking about the very beginning. Break everything down and then you can work through it and learn properly, by the way, I looked up a glossary C++ Primer 5th Edition had one and it was fantastic for helping me understanding programming in basic english, online ones will probably work fairly well too though.</div>

You're a defeatist, you really think it's purely a matter of white vs ethnic minorities? You're the sort of dipshit I'm mocking. Some of the west's staunchest allies have been blacks who don't go for the democrat's plantation mentality and have dealt with the left's own racism first hand, anti-communist hispanics and anti-communist asians who lived under communism and know that bullshit for what it is. I'd rather have them on my side than a coward like you who rolls over for a bunch of soyboys and fat karens at the first opportunity.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm not a zoomer, I was born in the 90's but you've referenced the exact system I've seen and I went from mildly left wing and a-political on social issues when I first started, as I went into my teens I became more and more Libertarian until now I'm just an outright Voluntaryist and would happily see the whole education system burn for what they've done to children because these companies are only implementing these policies as a direct result of university and school indoctrination creating a mob of deluded tantrum throwers who screech when they can't be racist towards white people and attack others for thinking differently. 

I can completely understand though in this situation why somebody would become a legitimate racist towards ethnic minorities, it's just not the correct conclusion and an incredibly uneducated peasant way of looking at things which is why I mock the nazi larpers for falling into the trap of leftists. The racial identity politics is exactly what the left wants, because it means they get their race war and can stay in power using ethnic voting blocs for years to come, how do I know this? I live in one of the most left wing areas of my country and I know exactly how the left gets their votes. I think even a lot of Trump supporters and general anti-woke types are in denial about these tactics and don't know how the game is played so they incorrectly point towards anything else. It will take 5 - 10 years, but I will be having a huge amount of fun fucking with all these people now I have taken appropriate steps to protect myself from the left's bullshit mob tactics and doxxing.

I'll write it again as a tldr, racial identitarians and nazi larpers are a bunch of stupid peasants who have fallen for the racial politics ploy by the left. They want you hating all ethnic minorities so they can scapegoat you as the evil 'alt-right' and 'white supremacists' and tell people to vote for them in order to get rid of you, what a convenient boogeyman they've created. Thankfully they're so small in number they're pretty meaningless even with the constant fear mongering in the media so people just laugh.</div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, I just feel like the article is potentially underestimating the effect various factors like the lockdown has had on chip availability, back when it first happen the switch instantly went out of stock and the scalpers got to work on the prices with that. Then next hit was the graphics cards, it seems to me like that would then have a knock on effect with everything else as people moved to other indoor entertainment tech to get their fix. 

I wonder if this goes a bit deeper than it simply being a simple chip shortage because of course there's the cryptocurrency aspect of it as well where the miners would just grab every graphics card they could get their hands on on top of that driving people to other products they wouldn't have normally considered. Then of course after the dust has settled all the stores are out so they're having to restock again and it's taking a long time for them to get back up and of course a lot of resources. If you get me, we've had the lockdown, the cryptocurrency boom all at once and that seems to me to be something the article ignores because they're trying to cite things like China/US tensions.

It's also worth pointing out that a lot of our chip manufacturing all seems to come from the same place, which was an incredibly stupid idea so if a country decides to just arbitrarily shut down all borders citing covid that's going to fuck everything up too.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's such an insufferably normie interpretation of the current chip shortage, I have to wonder whether people even really want to buy televisions that much these days because as we know the PC market is going berserk call me ignorant because I'm not that knowledgeable on this but I wouldn't have thought the market share in televisions these days would even be all that significant, they even tend to act more as large scale monitors these days than traditional televisions and just have streaming services built in. Is it possible that it's more likely that chip manufacturers are having to divert manufacturing to cope with the ridiculous demand for PC components generally and that is having a knock on effect on the availability of televisions etc. as a result? I also think that there's more than likely some rather obnoxious profiteering going on with retailers taking advantage of the fact that people are desperate for an entertainment medium so they'll pay any price rather than wait out the cheeky fucks so they lose money for being greedy.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oh for the record I'm just using it for storage or maybe running games on it, I use a HDD as my primary backup but it's incredibly old now and I think I should look at buying an SSD soon in case it decides to go kaput plus I'm always happy to have fast storage. You answered my question for me generally though so I know that it won't be an ideal situation to use the enclosure for anything other than easy access to my files. The reason I was asking was that I plan on getting an enclosure so I can just safely isolate my most important backups while I work on transferring all of my components to a new case. Once I do that and I know nothing has gone wrong then I'll plug the SSD in as normal to the motherboard and put away the enclosure for safe keeping maybe in case I ever need to fiddle with the PC, at least that's the plan. Seems like a much more cost effective and sensible option than buying a whole external hard drive of some kind if I know the backup SSD will work.</div>

A shadowy company residing at a shared workspace above a Florida bank announced to the world’s computer networks that it was now managing a colossal, previously idle chunk of the internet owned by the U.S. Department of Defense</a>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Another reason why I'm a believer in the wireless connections now over wired, the joke is they go through all that effort and expense to lay that cable and then the speeds you get at the end of it aren't even that good or consistent. We have the exact same problem here in the UK, when 5G rolls in the broadband companies are going to go bankrupt no matter how much anti-5G propaganda gets pumped out.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">To be fair I think it's actually normies this time around that are ruining everything because they've suddenly discovered gaming as a hobby, either way, expect thousands of 'used' graphics cards or PCs to suddenly start appearing on ebay towards the end of the year I suspect when they're done with everything and they can go outside again. I don't think the cryptocurrency prices have risen all that much to really justify the current crazy.

They went for the hand sanetiser and toilet rolls, then they went for all the flour, then the switch, now the fuckers are all going for PC components. They thought they were going after essentials and now they're going after the luxury items so they don't lose their minds in isolation.</div>
