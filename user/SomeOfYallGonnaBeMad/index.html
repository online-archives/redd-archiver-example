Israel isn't even complying with the court. You're literally just making shit up. Also, guess which country has all of its charges against goddamn unraw dropped because they would complete bs? Israel ding ding ding. Killing 25,000 isn't? Fuck you. Israel has killed objectively more babies and civilians. How did Israel form? By ethnic cleansing. Why does everyone else in the region hate Israel, the ethnic cleansing and apartheid. Doesn't make ethnic cleansing ok, but you're knuckle dragging stone chucking proto human cro magnon stupid if you can't work out the math on that one. Also, Israel has been killing its own hostages. Google Hannibal doctrine. Also that 1600 had a very large number of IDF soldiers which are genuine fair military targets in a war. Civilians never are but y'all's military is being beaten by a goddamn terrorist group in terms of disproportionate killing</div>

There is not ongoing genocide of Jews, you're just coping and afraid of brown people. Whatever you're smoking I'd like some. The West Bank? Again, who's doing the killing there? Jewish settlers, which group was just sanctioned by the court and had their actions brought up in the icj as possible genocide, the settlers. It could and does mean free to fucking walk around their ancestral lands. Again, the world doesn't revolve around you or your shitty ignorant worldview. I could walk up to plenty of people in favor of Palestine and they'd tell me that. I can't go to Gaza because Israel is bombing it. Goddamn the level of cognitive dissonance</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Except it's not. That's your personal assertion. It's also a Palestinian saying, so the Jewish perspective is mostly irrelevant. Is it used in a genocidal context? Yes. Is it always used that way? No. The context matters, but it's not inherently antisemitic. It's also not in reference to that, it's in reference to Palestinians reclaiming their land. You're making context up to cope which is funny considering it's Israel in the icj for genocide charges and Israel who was told to lay off genocidal practice</div>
