Over time after clicking the userpages of the people heckling me I noticied that most the clique posted to the vile /r/vegancirclejerk sub. Aside: circlejerk subs are low quality shit and that type of loserdom was frowned on the pre-Reddit discussion medums. Eventually I noticied that circlejerk sub advertised their irc channel and lurked and found them discussing me numerous times and eventually the nerd ringleaders of that shit circlejerk sub and channel became /r/vegan mods.

This is the summary of why Reddit sucks so hard. Honestly why did you waste so much of your life for Reddit karma and astroturf? They have turned this shithole medium into the most massive MMORPG for mega-nerd, geeks, outcasts, pedophiles, immature political shills, racists. Most normal people post on Reddit and probably get sick of such games, leaving only the outcasts and agenda pushers to tilt at it. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">What makes Reddit suck the most is organized groups of nerds who use persistent irc/slackchat and discord. Me, I am just one person arguing with my opinions, but on Reddit I have learned I am frequently battling large cliques of nerds organizing/brigading off of Reddit via persistent chat clients. I remember once on /r/anticonsumption I wrote how libraries shouldn't rent out video games or movies or something and like 4-5 librarians with no post history to that sub heckled, berated and downvoted me. But what are the chances so many librarians all stumbled on the same thread on a sub they never/rarely posted on? That is the story of this shithole, anything you write, a group or nerds and outcasts could descend from dank nerd persistent chat channels and heckle you and banish your posts below the viewing threshold. Of course when that happens often enough and you lash out, the nerd mods will ban you if go against their agenda and circlejerk. Paid corporate shilling is something I encounter much less, most often when you try to write against monsanto and gmos. Though shilling from political parties and personalities could be why certain subs like /r/politics made it impossible to support Donald trump leading the rise of /r/thedonald. But that is hard to tell without going onto their nerdy persistent chat channels, and one thing is certain Reddit's nerd moderator class sucks, they are intolerant, agenda pushing and have no lives. 

Honestly I have no respect for people who fit in on Reddit, because there is a reason they fit in here: because they cannot anywhere else. I never saw account with lots of karma and actually read the posts and thought they were worthwhile, mostly what is worth reading here can never get upvoted. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I definitely think shills are highly active. If you want them to show for sure start writing about GMOs, monsanto, etc. You will see user accounts with no organic post history pop up that just jump from sub to sub to defend agro-chemical giants to reinforce the "but science" circlejerk. See: 

&gt;https://leakofnations.com/monsanto-accused-in-court-of-conducting-an-army-of-shills-to-crackdown-on-negative-online-comments-monsanto-shills-roundup-cancer-link-monsanto-ghostwrite-scientific-articles/

Or you could check out the sub /r/shills. But I don't think that is why Reddit sucks I encounter few people I suspect of being paid to Reddit, Reddit sucks because it has turned into a real life MMORPG for super neckbeards:   

&gt;[Reddit is dominated by neckbeard cliques that organize on IRC/slackchat/discord](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64vqph/reddit_is_dominated_by_neckbeard_cliques_that/)

&gt;Reddit is dominated by perhaps a few thousand super neckbeards who have the most karma, mod between 20-200+ subs, who have the largest clique of "online friends" to game the voting system, aka the unidan effect and silence enemies or karma competitors, and put in more time on Reddit and cultivating these friendship cliques than some of us spend working. Reddit gives too many tools for people with no lives like the voting system, the subreddit system and the ability to create infinite alternative accounts to turn the medium into the "game of Reddit" that they then "win". Which of course comes at the price of losing in real life. 

I actually respect the shills more than the neckbeards, at least I can understand monetary motivation for having sucky opinions.

/r/blog     
/r/announcements    
/r/changelog    

And you can see they are not very smart and squandering the last resources of a company that never turned a profit for its investors on nonsense that cannot bring revenue or help Reddit be more than a shitposting, karmawhoring and meme-ing toilet of the internet that few want to support with Reddit gold membership. In other words even if they do make features or policy changes, it is not the type that would make this place high quality for enough people to be willing to give money to support the site. 

Or just search Alexis Ohanian on Youtube to hear how that dunce has a bloated sense that this is a good medium contributing something to the world instead of a pile of refuse taking up the baton from its chanboard predecessors in redpilling the internet discourse for the worse. Here you go:

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are a good example of why the core demographic on this site is a cancer that won't allow serious discussion ever. The only thing people like you can seriously discuss is gamergate and other crap that only Reddit and chanboards care about. I didn't relink the source of the admin quote, that they will only punish doxxing if proven via Reddit not from a screenshot from persistent chats, but here it is:

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/61twfz/i_think_reddits_doxxing_policyrule_needs/dfix6vd/

Which essentially means Reddit rules selectively enforced as they are already, are only gonna be enforced on the least invested regular users. Which allows the superneckbeards to run wild on persistent chat clients where they actually organize and ruin this medium more than it is already ruined. That is how most subs push agendas: one superneckbeard gets there first as a top level moderator on a subreddit turf and fishes a persistent chat client for fellow mega-nerds with the same agenda to help enforce a circlejerk. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">My argument is plain and you just don't want to hear it because you are one of those who fits in on Reddit(and the outcast core demographic will forgive all the shittiness here and on chanboards because it allows them to upturn conventional society on cyberspace) and acts like the nonsense that goes on here should be normalized. If Reddit was honest they would change their slogan to "the frontpage of the internet for ouctast nerds and geeks." 

Alot of what I wrote can be proven, and I tried to best as I could in this thread from my experiences after entering /r/vegancirclejerk's persistent irc channel, I wrote this eventually:  

&gt;[Reddit is dominated by neckbeard cliques that organize on IRC/slackchat/discord](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64vqph/reddit_is_dominated_by_neckbeard_cliques_that/)

&gt;Reddit is dominated by perhaps a few thousand super neckbeards who have the most karma, mod between 20-200+ subs, who have the largest clique of "online friends" to game the voting system, aka the unidan effect and silence enemies or karma competitors, and put in more time on Reddit and cultivating these friendship cliques than some of us spend working. Reddit gives too many tools for people with no lives like the voting system, the subreddit system and the ability to create infinite alternative accounts to turn the medium into the "game of Reddit" that they then "win". Which of course comes at the price of losing in real life. 

I supported my analysis as best I could with screenshots from irc showing the vegan redditor nerds were mentioning my username in their persistent chat irc channel numerous times, which explained why I was downvoted so hard in /r/vegan. I even caught an admin writing this gem:  

&gt;We will take action against users that post another user's personal information, either directly on reddit or linking to it off-site. ... **However, we usually cannot rely on screenshots because they are easily faked. If this is all occurring off-site and not being posted anywhere on reddit, then there is usually little we can do** ...

Which essentially means the rules of Reddit are only gonna apply to normal casual users who do their brigading, doxxing actually on Reddit, and they will never apply to the super invested neckbeards who do the same except on irc, slack, discord because they don't accept screenshots from persistent chats as evidence.

On the non-Reddit internet, the best and biggest discussion forum for Italy is never italy.com, for greece it is not greece.com, the best search engine never was at search.com, etc. But in the bizarro Reddit world the opposite is the case, it matters who gets first to the most pertinent subreddit turf and it doesn't matter how abusive the mods or low-quality the discussion is, being there first is the most important thing on the right subreddit name turf is all that matters here and no matter how toxic the sub is, it will never get unseated by an upstart rival with a lesser namespace. The only counter-example is /r/trees unseating /r/marijuana I believe. 

Thinking more about this, a large part of the reason why is likely because Reddit's internal search sucks so hard and is frequently slow or even disabled when traffic surges. But if you go to /r/blogs or /r/announcements the idiot staff is always focused on useless concerns, features or secret santa type bullshit and not actually righting their sinking ship that always loses revenue and is only gonna get eventually dumped by Advanced Publications. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You think it is just /r/india? Reddit is dominated by nerd outcasts who camp out in persistent chat clients and push weirdo agendas that don't have much currency in the real world most often. No geographic subreddit represents true to life demographics or popular opinion because reddit is mostly white male chankids, hardcore gamers, IT nerds, etc. and other undesireables. 

The amount of censorship and agenda pushing on Reddit is incredible -- and it all serves one purpose -- so the geeks stuffed into lockers in high school can turn the tides. Reddit just gives too many tools for people with no lives: the ability to be a tyrant by just getting to subreddit turf first, it punishes the brigading on Reddit by casual users, but doesn't even bother to investigate the brigading that hardcore nerds do via persistent chat clients, it has an easy to game voting system, it allows people to create unlimited accounts, etc. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That is not how Reddit works, it is a circlejerk game, what is upvoted first to a submission sets the internal circlejerk. First off over half of posts are ignored, and often the same content that was once ignored, gets subsequently massively upvoted:   

&gt;http://www.randalolson.com/2015/01/11/over-half-of-all-reddit-posts-go-completely-ignored/


Just look at the "unidan effect":   

&gt;http://mashable.com/2014/07/31/unidan-banned-reddit-permanent/#5BDQU4ZYzGq8

&gt;Reddit user Unidan, known off of the Internet as biologist Ben Eisenkop, has been shadowbanned from the site due to vote manipulation.

&gt;Reddit administrators discovered that Eisenkop maintained five side accounts, which he used to both upvote his own submissions and comments, and downvote opposing comments.

&gt;...

One nerd with no life willing to create and vote with five side accounts was enough to beat the voting system, because people see what is upvoted early and adapt themselves:   

&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20130909115013/http://jeffdechambeau.com/redditing-to-the-mean.html

&gt;Because having higher karma is desired, users behave in ways that will get them karma (karma-whoring). Similarly, users who do not agree with the fat part of the bell curve are punished by losing karma. Posts with low karma are sorted to the bottom and are less-read and set out from the chorus.

&gt;It follows that the way to get the most karma is to say stuff that most people will agree with, that is, to be average.

&gt;It’s therefore in the interests of reddit users to be as agreeable and indistinguishable as possible from the average voice, giving us the hive-mind of tedium and mediocrity that we see.</div>

&gt;Wow, talk about censorship.    
&gt;75 comments posted to this story thread, and 59 were removed! See:

You can see the actual thread here without deletions:

The funny thing is when I pointed out the massive censorship pathetic nerd marks of Reddit, thanked the moderator for his hard work! No wonder why Redditors have such a horrible reputation on the non-Reddit internet... Actually Redditors don't even have a good image on the Reddit internet, as illustrated by this /r/announcements thread to discuss the abandoning of the defaults and the following very highly voted comments:      

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6eh6ga/reddits_new_signup_experience/dia9w49/     
&gt;Too late for that[to improve the quality of some of the defaults], I'd think. They already have millions of morons subscribed to them.

The next highest voted nested reply dished out even more:    
&gt;Right. New subs will have to accumulate millions of morons organically. Old defaults won't lose their preloaded morons, but may slowly start to recover as the existing morons lose their passwords, fall down stairs, forget to breathe, etc.

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">New social media literally creates a bubble of isolation and self flagellation. Facebook has algorithms to make people see suggestions of what the site thinks they already like based on past likes. Reddit is all circlejerks of agreement and those who don't are often downvoted below the viewing threshold, banned, etc. Younger people who grew up with that as the normal I feel are going to be less tolerant and just go apeshit when they see outside views, which explains alot of Reddit behavior. </div>
