            Comment on: <a href="../../r/RedditCensors/comments/mblwuo/reddit_its_literally_censuring_articles_about_a/#comment-gs0t404">Reddit it&#39;s literally censuring articles about a RAPIST because he is a reddit employee. Know his name: Aimee Challenor</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Adding some context from another thread:

This person who shall not be named hired her father to work for her and the political party.Her father was found to have raped and tortured a child. She hired him after his arrest for his crimes. Interestingly he commuted his rape and torture of a 10 year old girl whilst he himself was dressed as a little girl. The admin lived with its father while this rape took place over several days, and claims to have no idea the rape was happening.

Then she was fired from the next party she joined because paedophilic tweets were found on her husbands account. Her husband admits to ‘writing smut’ about minors and fantasizing about ‘children having sex, sometimes with adults, sometimes kidnapped and forced into bad situations.’ He also has ‘fantasies of rape’ although that seems pretty insignificant compared to child rape.

Furthermore this person is allegedly close friends with another trans person (male to female) who is a power mod on Reddit moderating 80 or more subreddits, mainly LGBT subs some are for lgbt kids. This is worrying because this person is allegedly a ‘baby fur’ which is, as I understand a furry attracted to child fur characters. Ostensibly a furry paedophile.

To make matters even stranger this character sometimes goes by the marriage surname of the person who shall not be named and her husband. This person responded to a tweet by she who shall not be named referring to herself as family. It can be inferred that they are in a sexual relationship, likely all three of them. This can be further evidenced by a Reddit post by an account linked to them detailing a polyamorous relationship with someone from scotland and someone from America, the locations of her husband and her friend. It seems pretty clear that she is in a sexual relationship With a paedophile and a ‘baby fur’ whilst having a diaper fetish like her paedophile father.

The person who shall not be named has also had a furry Twitter account linked to them through a pseudonym that is pretty much their name and references their hometown. This contains diaper fetish material. (Her father wore a diaper while he raped and tortured a 10 year old girl and her friend who is a ‘baby fur’ also post in diaper fetish blogs).

This person is a checklist of things that Reddit likes to pretend don’t exist.

Diagnosed with autism, brought up by a paedophile, is married to a paedophile ,became trans (male to female) and is a trans activist.

Honestly her life reads like a straw man invented by social conservatives..... except she is real.</div>
