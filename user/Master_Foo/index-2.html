<p>I mean, yeah, I get you on the PHP thing. I mean who gives a fuck about PHP anymore? But even NOBODYER gives a fuck about Ruby (on Rails). That's how embarrassing this list is for Ruby (on Rails don't forget the rails because otherwise Ruby is 100% pointless).</p>
<p>OP never said the language has to be &quot;easy&quot;. He just said he hates forced indenting. PHP solves his problem. Or Javascript, or Perl, but let's recommend some obscure hipster language instead.</p>
<p>I mean, fuck, as long as we are recommending obscure languages, let's do it right and throw in D. It blows everything else in this list out of the water. But as much as I love sucking on the giant D, I don't go around recommending it, because I'm not a fucking hipster.</p></div>

<p>When did I ever say I use PHP? I don't (Not for years anyway.).</p>
<p>This isn't some stupid language holy war. I'm just stating a statistical fact about various languages. Nobody uses Ruby, (especially without it's famous crutch, Rails). You can talk about the 1.4% who do use it all day. But if 1.4% is all you have, you don't have much of an argument to stand on.</p>
<p>What you DO have is a bunch of hipsters. This isn't an insult. It is an accurate demographic landscape of Ruby <strong>(Don't forget the Rails)</strong></p></div>

Which is a statement of fact, not ideology. In order to be a successor to something, people need to at least use it. Ruby <strong>ON RAILS</strong> <em>(cough, cough)</em> 1.4% market saturation is statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>As for all the examples you gave, yes sometimes hipsters make a good product. That wasn't the issue. The issue here is that it is hipsters who chose the technology. A <strong>statistically insignificant technology</strong>.</p>
<p>Writing a application in Ruby now is kind of like writing an application in Cold Fusion back in the 2000's. Did people make legitimate applications? Sure. Did anyone really give a fuck about Cold Fusion? No. Only the hipsters gave a fuck about Cold Fusion and only hipsters give a fuck about Ruby <strong>(ON RAILS)</strong>.</p></div>

<p>Furthermore, Ruby developers aren't really Ruby developers. They are Ruby on <strong>RAILS</strong> developers. Nobody (Except for hipsters) is using Ruby for the sake of Ruby. It's more accurate to say 1.3% of developers are Rails developers and only 0.01% are actually Ruby developers. Ruby wouldn't even make the TIOBE index if it weren't for Rails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PHP is FUBAR.</p>

<p>I agree, which is why I don't use it any more. However, if we are using the TIOBE index to justify a language, it still beats out Ruby.</p></div>

<p>&quot;Hipster Logic&quot; just means that something has a lot of flair without any original substance. For instance, if you compare Ruby to more popular languages, you'll see that it doesn't really solve any problem. It's primary virtue is to aesthetically appeal to the ego of the programmer.</p>
<p>So, while the applications of Python are great in scope, (Academia, Systems Admin, Gaming, Application Dev, RESTful Web Dev, etc..), Ruby tends to almost only be used for RESTful web development. In fact, if it weren't for Rails, Ruby wouldn't even be on the charts. The only job you are likely to get as a Ruby developer is as a Rails developer.</p>
<p>Sure, the Ruby fan-boy will point out the odd application which is not a RESTful web service, but those are the exception not the rule.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I like Ruby. But it doesn't solve any problem that a more popular language does just as well. And thus the only people who are attracted to it are &quot;Hipster Types&quot;, who like it because the language appeals to their ego. Not because of Ruby's merit.</p></div>

<p>Generally speaking, any language which has the ideology of &quot;Only One Correct Way To Do It.&quot; is an opinionated language. So, you are going to have people talking about &quot;The Ruby way of doing something&quot;, meaning you could do it this way, but the &quot;Ruby way&quot; is the way you are supposed to do it. But someone else is always deciding which way is the &quot;correct&quot; way. It's a matter of (someone else's) opinion and you are expected to conform to it.</p>
<p>In other words, there are many ways of skinning a cat, but there is a specific &quot;Ruby Way&quot; of skinning a cat. This culture gets much worse as you delve into Rails. I'm fairly certain Rails should be classified as a cult.</p>
<p>Python is guilty of being opinionated as well, but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>C / C++ is the anti-thesis of an opinionated language in that it's philosophy is: &quot;We expect our devs to be competent. They probably know what the fuck they are doing. So, do whatever the fuck you want.&quot;</p>
<p>A good source to show that Ruby is opinionated would be <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby.html">this</a> interview with Ruby creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto.</p>
<p>Here are some snippets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I emphasize the feeling, in particular, how I feel using Ruby. I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone</p>
<p>I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.</p>

There is a great deal of &quot;hipster logic&quot; which has seeped into the language as a result. Of course, they won't call it &quot;hipster logic&quot;, but you can read between the lines in the language manifestos and understand what I'm talking about.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Let's say there is a package manager which uses git sources as packages.</p>
<p>It automatically downloads a git project as a package and it wants to compile. which version does it compile? Does it compile Branch 1.1.0? Branch 1.3.0? Branch 1.4? Branch 2.1? Which of these versions are stable? Which are alpha / Beta / unstable?</p>
<p>You can't tell just by looking at the numbers. But you can designate master to branch 1.4 (Which happens to be the stable branch). By your logic the package manager would use Branch 2.1 (Which is an alpha branch)</p>
<p>A package manager doesn't understand arbitrary versioning schemes. But it does understand that it is standard to include a master branch which represents the most important current branch. If there is a master branch the package manager always knows to compile whatever master branch represents.</p>
<p>Likewise with humans. When I download a git repository, I don't have to mess around figuring out which branch is the latest stable branch. I know I can compile master and everything will be the most important current branch.</p></div>

<p>Which is perhaps a naive opinion.</p>
<p>All names are meaningless. That's the nature of abstraction. It's not the name which is meaningful, but what it represents.</p>
<p>In the case of &quot;master&quot; it represents a generic identifier for the most important current branch. At any given time during the development process, this could be &quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;v.1.0.0&quot; etc. Since these are arbitrary, we have &quot;master&quot; to denote the most important current branch.

<p>When you look at charts like the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">Tiobe Index</a> What you are seeing are numbers held up by the language's past inertia. The only companies hiring for PHP devs are run by greybeards who can't learn a new trick and companies maintaining legacy software, like Word Press and PHPBB.</p>
<p>PHP was designed to replace PERL and it has succeeded in becoming obsolete along side it.</p>
<p>Upgrading a LAMP stack is kind of like upgrading Geocities. If you are going to bother, you might as well just tear everything down and start from scratch.</p></div>

<p>You can take a <a href="https://github.com/Cabal-Syndicate">look</a> if you like. I'm actually OK with <strong>productive</strong> criticism.</p>
<p>The general idea behind it is, if you like the idea of <em>Rails</em> or <em>Django</em> for fast web development, you'll like the idea behind this framework for game development. I admit, purists will hate it, but that's OK. This isn't for purists.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>OP said he wants to learn Programming, he didn't specifically say he wants to learn Computer Science. There is a significant difference between the two professions. I'm just recommending Python because it's the easiest general purpose language.</p>
<p>The problem with the &quot;starting low level&quot; approach is that it requires a level of knowledge / skill / theory a newbie just does not have.</p>
<p>Assembly is archaic and a strong foundation of Computer Science theory is a prerequisite to understanding what is going on. Also the barrier to entry is high in that the student needs to learn how to use the tools first before he can actually start programming.</p>
<p>The idea with starting with Python is the student can learn what a IF statement is TODAY with minimal barrier to entry. These concepts are pretty much universal. <strong>If</strong> and <strong>when</strong> OP needs to move on to other languages, he can.</p>
<p>Learning low language concepts is a good goal, but it might not ever be necessary. Probably wont ever be necessary for 99% of developers. This is something that should be worked toward as a goal, not a starting point.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>That's fine, whatever floats your boat. I have a few problems with the &quot;Top Down via UI&quot; approach though.</p>
<p>The reason I don't draw things out is because I consider the UI &quot;marketing&quot;. For the same reason you wouldn't make the package for the toothbrush before you design the actual toothbrush. I won't design the interface before the model.</p>
<p>The model is the product. The UI is just what marketers use to sell the product.</p>
<p>UI is a subjective thing while the model is objective. Put 3 guys in a room and have them approve the UI and they will be there for hours arguing. Put them in a room with a model and</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They tend to think more rationally about what the NEED and less about what the WANT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They would rather get out of there because models are boring to pointy-haired-boss types.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, a project is likely to have multiple UIs, especially if it's a RESTful project. So, when I have a prototype of the model I just send the marketing guy the API and tell him to do what he wants with it. He can build a UI for web. He can build a UI for Android, etc.</p>
<p>Generally, I think UI should be considered separate projects in the same way designing a toothbrush is a separate project from designing a toothbrush package.</p></div>

<p>Find people who use and value your tool and provide incentive for them to donate. For instance, poll you user base on features they'd like to have implemented. Then provide a bounty program in which they can donate towards this feature.</p>
<p>So, for instance, you find that a certain % of users want XYZ feature. (Making it open source, etc). You determine it is going to cost $ABC to pay a programmer to do this. When you talk to the people who use your tool about feature XYZ refer them to the donation page, which is kind of like kickstarter, showing how much is needed and how much has been donated.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Generally, the most planning I do is to create the model first. So, I open MySQL Workbench (of alternate database equivalent) which has a diagram browser of the relational structure of the database.</p>
<p>This gives me a good idea of how to plan the project itself. Because 90% of the project is going to be determined by the structure of the model anyway.</p>
<p>After the model is created, often a scaffolding script can read the model and make a bare-bones prototype of how the program would roughly work.</p>
<p>I like this approach because the planning isn't just &quot;mental masturbation&quot; It actually creates a usable prototype which can be demonstrated.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> don't draw things out. Make a prototype of the model.</p></div>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You want control of the framework's IP.</p>

<li>
<p>A sufficient framework does not exist in your target language.</p>

<li>
<p>You want a better understanding of engines.</p>

<li>
<p>The available framework costs money to licence. (And you don't want to pay)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reasons not to &quot;Roll your own&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's faster to learn an already available framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will probably have a framework with a lot of unknown bugs without a large community which uses it and reports bugs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can hire professionals who already know a popular framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the next guy comes along he's going to have to learn a new obscure framework when it's probably better to just have him learn an existing framework with better documentation and community support.</p>

You could learn it by yourself, and a lot of people here are going to give you some solid advice about doing that. Having access to a professor and a lab full of peers learning the same thing as you is a valuable resource.</p>
<p>If you are already comfortable with other languages, like Python, C shouldn't be much of a problem, language wise. </p>
<p>Learning C is 10% learning the language and 90% learning how to use the tools. Here's what you REALLY need to focus on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn the tools. Specifically, the gcc tool chain. Specifically the debugger. Learn how to use these tools without an IDE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointers are a bitch, but they are useful. Unlike Pyhon, you need to actually know how pointers work in C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn how to safely allocate and deallocate memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Datastructures. Walls and Mirrors (book) is a good resource. But you should probably also take a class for this for guidance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, take the &quot;self teaching&quot; advice everyone else is giving here. It too is valid.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Like I said, if there is a good reason to break the rule, It's fine to do so. It's more of a way of being self conscious about good practices.</p>
<p>Your comment got me questioning myself to see if I actually follow this and how strictly I do so. So I did an analysis on a library I'm writing. The average lines of code in my project (per file) are 55. This is excluding &quot;Wasted lines&quot; like comments, and &quot;Documentation&quot; lines which can be collapsed by my editor.</p>
<p>At my resolution, I can see 51 lines of code at any time. So, I'm breaking the rule on average by 4 lines. But I think it's within the acceptable margin of error.</p>
<p>Then I did an analysis on the code base which uses the library. the average number of lines was 46. So, I would have to say the technique works, in practice, for the most part.</p>
<p>Another thing to realize is I'm using &quot;D&quot; a language with a lot of syntax sugar, so that helps. C is a bit more verbose and tends to require more lines to do the same job. For instance, the garbage collector pretty much makes the de constructor unnecessary;</p>
<p>Also I prefer putting my code blocks on the same line as the declaration, for instance:</p>
<pre><code>void foo(){
</code></pre>
<p>as opposed to:</p>
<pre><code>void foo()
{
</code></pre>
<p>so that also helps.</p></div>

<p>Why? Because part of the cleanup process is to briefly halt all threads while the collector does it's job. This is fine for most applications, like a word processor. But you don't want arbitrary garbage cleaning on your space station. Do that shit in a predictable way, like C does.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>My general rule of thumb is: A class, or file containing related sets of code must fit on the screen without needing to scroll.</p>
<p>It's kind of arbitrary because a person with a 4k monitor is going to have more code than my 1080p screen. But the general reasoning behind it is, a function should do one job. If it takes up more than a few lines it is probably doing more than one job and should be broken up into multiple functions.</p>
<p>Likewise with classes. If a class can't fit on one screen without scrolling it probably is really more than one class and should be broken up.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are good reasons to ignore this rule and in such cases the rule should be ignored. It's more of a smart guideline. If your code takes up more than one page there should be alarms going off in your head telling you there likely is something wrong.</p></div>

<p>I never claimed using a CLI makes you a better developer. What I'm saying is, we need a way to determine if Java AS A LANGUAGE is intrinsically better than some other language. Therefore, we need to get rid of the cruch Java developers rely on. Which is the IDE.</p>
<p>Then we can watch the Java monkey's futile attempts at creating library and then we realize that it's not the <strong>LANGUAGE</strong> that makes work easier, but the tools the <strong>IDE</strong> provides.</p>
<p>Then we can happily go back to work using the IDE but with the new wisdom admitting that &quot;Writing a library in Java is easier&quot; is just an old wives tale.</p></div>

<p>(for instance maintainability, ease of development, deployment) Java wins by a fair amount.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All you are doing here is advocating for sub-par developers who are locked into specific tools. None of these things actually have anything to do with code base. All of these things generally require a non-langage tool. Like an IDE. So, you can't really credit Java as a language for any of these gains.</p>
<p>Basically, your argument is: &quot;The tools for Java are made in the mindset that Java developers are lazy retards. The GCC tool chain assumes that programmers are competent and know how to do it themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Which isn't a good way to describe Java developers. Basically, you'll attract the 2 kinds of people I described above. 1) The college student who never bothered to learn. 2) The Pointy Haired Boss.</p></div>

<p>Can you point me to a resource that explains and defines what the OOP way is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really, most OOP languages are actually &quot;Multi-Paradigm&quot; languages. In that, the language supports &quot;OOP&quot;, but also supports &quot;procedural&quot;, &quot;functional&quot;, and other common paradigms. So, now we are back to skinning cats. Which is fine, you shouldn't feel pressured into purely OOP programming styles.</p>
<p>The main thing here, and someone already said this. Be consistent in the way you program. If you choose OOP try not to mix it up with &quot;functional&quot; unless there is a good case for it.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that OOP (in compiled languages) doesn't give you any performance gain or loss. (Exception being virtual methods (usually). This is the rule with a few exceptions)</p>
<p>All OOP is, is a method to organize your code to be more manageable for <strong>YOU</strong> the human reading the code. That is all.</p>
<p>OOP is an illusion. It doesn't exist after it's been compiled. Keep this in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the second snippets cater more to immutability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It could be. I'm not very familiar with C# and less so with F#. But I'm not sure he is correct if immutable works the same way in other languages. I'm assuming that if you are using the &quot;point&quot; object for a car, that &quot;point&quot; data is going to change as the car moves around the track. This would make it unsuitable for immutable data because immutable data isn't supposed to change.</p>
<p>But, I'll admit my ignorance, maybe C# and F# have this covered. I'm fairly sure that such a thing would not fly in C++ though.</p></div>

<p>but there IS an OOP way to do this.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the &quot;distance_to&quot; method should go in the &quot;point&quot; class. Why? Because the point of OOP is to marry data to the methods which manipulate that data.</p>
<p>This way, everyone knows that if you want to measure distance between two points the methods to do that are in the &quot;point&quot; class. (Where else would it be? the &quot;Calculator&quot; class? Why the fuck is it there?)</p>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>If you are asking these questions now, it probably means you don't have the background to really understand the significance of what I am about to tell you. The upside is, &quot;Why&quot; and &quot;How&quot; doesn't really matter. I don't reccommend worrying about the underlying mechanics just yet</p>
<p>But anyway, here are some pearls:</p>
<p>The difference is that C is a machine language and Python is an interpreted language.</p>
<p>The C compiler converts your C code into binary which your CPU can understand natively. It requires no interpreter. The benefit of this is the code is very efficient. But, you must compile a different binary for each architecture you want to support.</p>
<p>The Python interpreter, on the other hand, is compiled to &quot;non-native byte code&quot; (&quot;.pyc&quot; files) which isn't architecture dependent. That code is executed inside of an interpreter which is similar to a virtual machine. Since it is the virtual machine which runs the instructions you don't need to compile for each architecture. However, the cost that there is a lot of overhead so python programs are much more CPU and memory intensive.</p></div>

<p>step 1: Make sure your file has the &quot;shebang&quot; as it's first line. here is a sample &quot;Hello World&quot; program:</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/python
print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>step 2: make sure your file is executable:</p>
<pre><code>chmod 777 ./filename.py
</code></pre>
<p>step 3: execute using</p>
<pre><code>$ ./filename.py
</code></pre></div>
