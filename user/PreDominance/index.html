I would say that that Muslim countries have militaries capable of wiping each other out, but from a global perspective, are unable to do so. The geopolitical atmosphere over there isn't something I'm entirely familiar with, but I can't imagine that the world would sit idly by as these countries attacked each other indiscriminately, or waged all-out war.  
In short, to say that these countries haven't at the very least realized their own mortality, I think, would be false. Only time will tell if these countries adopt a new moral ground that preserves _all_ human life.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I suppose you're right in that comparisons could be a bit fairer, but I'm primarily concerned with modern countries and their relationships with these predominantly Muslim countries. I guess you could say I'm privileged in that regard -- or maybe I'm falling into a NoTrueScottsman fallacy in saying that the _modern_ Christianity is the real one -- i.e. no true Christian would do something so horrendous, whereas Muslims would not scoff at Chechnya creating concentration camps for gays.

I do agree with the fact that part of western values is toleration of other religions. I don't mean to imply that the countries I mentioned previously are solely Catholic/Christian, rather that these countries have roots that have allowed these countries to grow into rather peaceful and tolerable places, whereas middle eastern countries with Muslim roots aren't as..attractive, per se. 

As for the African continent as a whole -- I can't comment because I don't really have much clue about their religion or upbringing. The countries I mentioned before have roots in these Catholic-esque religions for, I believe, thousands of years, whereas a brief glance at Wikipedia suggests that African countries have deep roots in their own religions, and most of the recent high-catholic statistics are the result of vigorous missionary work: work which, so recent, probably will not be able to change deep-seated intolerance in their culture. At least not for some time. 

As an aside, thanks for speaking at length with this. Helps me realize my true thoughts/feelings on the matter. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I try to be objective, but honest with myself. Thanks.

For me I can agree that we should be vetting based on individual values rather than generalizing by religious values, but I believe you can gauge personal values from religious ones. I'm not going to say that Christianity is perfect now or in the past, but most recently the majority of conflicts between religion and modern world living have _not_ risen due to Christianity. Again -- Christianity, like most religions, has done some horrible things in the past, and some people still use it as an excuse to do horrible things today. But it has adapted to the modern world very well. Most western countries have roots in Catholicism or Christianity through which these lands are governed, and I would say it's working out well.  
You want to go to a tolerable land to find acceptance for your family? You go to Britain. Or Germany. Or Canada, or the US, etc. If I'm a gay Christian looking to get married, you think I'm going to have it in Saudi Arabia? 

I guess what I'm getting at is that I believe the Muslim religion needs a reformation such that it becomes a religion that tolerates various ideas and personalities akin to modern-day Christianity. I firmly believe that the difference between these two religions is that the average intolerable Christian (usually characterized as a Redneck) will look at a gay couple and say "hey man who cares let the fags get married", whereas the average intolerable Muslim would have them tried under their own laws and executed.

Maybe I have an entirely wrong perception. I'm open to that. But until I see the same sort of tolerance and acceptance emanating from Muslim countries that comes out of Western (predominantly Christian/Catholic) countries, I will continue to believe that the religion needs work.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">To be fair I did not mention a desire to kill Muslims. People in America understand black people in the sense that they oftentimes come from the shittiest parts of the country and with a rough history. To me and absolutely every other conservative I know there's no greater example of the American dream than in a black kid _trying_ to succeed. 

Muslims are something more unknown and distant. Everyone has a black friend but few have a Muslim friend. I make passing jokes about glassing the Middle East as well.. I'm not going to pretend it's not a bad situation.  
The problem is that the "left" won't come to terms with the simple fact that a vast majority of Muslims inside their own countries as well as a frighteningly large majority of Muslims inside a western countries simply do not hold values compatible with our way of life. I don't want my gay friends to be executed; I don't want my girlfriend to need to cover herself when she leave the house; I don't want to die for being a Christian. I don't want their laws to supersede the laws of my government and state. I don't want to be harmed for insulting Allah. And if you look it up (or ask me to - mobile) you'll find that more numbers than I'm comfortable with do not hold at least the above values.

That is the extent to which I am spiteful towards Muslims I haven't met, and it is why I supported lawful travel bans until we can figure out a better way to go through this shit. I say haven't met because prejudice is always overpowered by reality. There's a Muslim family that runs a pizza shop I've been to a few times - absolutely the most accommodating and lovely people. But I do not know the extent to which they hold their religion, and based on statistics I've read over, I do not want to start that conversation. </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The percentage of republicans and conservatives who are that idiotic and inhumane, I can guarantee you, is much lower than the percentage of delusional liberals and democrats. 

There's a big difference in prejudice and racism between wanting to kill all blacks, and walking on the other side if the road, for instance. Racism isn't black and white (pun intended), it's literally just a collection of observed and learned biases against a certain race or group of people. Want to end negative racism? Stop promoting the shittiest parts of these people's cultures; this applies to any race.</div>
