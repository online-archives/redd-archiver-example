    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt;**An 8-year-old second-grader in Los Angeles is a typical patient.** Born a girl, the child announced at 18 months, "I a boy" and has stuck with that belief. The family was shocked but now refers to the child as a boy and is watching for the first signs of puberty to begin treatment, his mother told The Associated Press.

/
&gt;**Offering sex-changing treatment to kids younger than 18** raises ethical concerns, and their parents' motives need to be closely examined, **said Dr. Margaret Moon, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' bioethics committee.**

/
&gt;**Some kids** may get a psychiatric diagnosis when they are just hugely uncomfortable with narrowly defined gender roles; or some may be gay and are coerced into treatment by **parents more comfortable with a sex change** than having a homosexual child, said Moon, who teaches at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics.

/
&gt;These children sometimes resort to self-mutilation to try to change their anatomy; the other two journal reports note that some face verbal and physical abuse and are prone to stress, depression and suicide attempts. Spack said those problems typically disappear in **kids who've had treatment and are allowed to live as the opposite sex.**

/
&gt;**At that point, the guidelines recommend puberty-blocking drugs until age 16, then lifelong sex-changing hormones with monitoring for potential health risks.**

&gt;The report details 97 girls and boys treated between 1998 and 2010; the youngest was 4 years old. Kids that young and their families get psychological counseling and are monitored until the first signs of puberty emerge, **usually around age 11 or 12. Then children are given puberty-blocking drugs**, in monthly $1,000 injections or implants imbedded in the arm.

/

From the very same paragraph you quoted and conspicuously cropped.
&gt;**His clinic has worked with local surgeons who've done breast removal surgery on girls at age 16**, but that surgery can be relatively minor, or avoided, if puberty is halted in time, he said

Nobody talks about murder like this, retard. You're playing coy, selectively highlighting the things that confirm your insane bias, and making asinine false equivalencies. God, you really love the idea of chopping up kids. Freak.</div>

No fantasy of mine. I have no fondness for Austrian painters. Or losers. It is the well known fantasy of some among the many lying "holocaust survivors" accepted as gospel among American academia.

&gt;Fascinating logic. Would you care to tell me where or when I said that white people or "Aryans" should be silenced, simply because of who or what they are? Given that I've modded for a number of conservative groups elsewhere, I'm going to feel very comfortable saying "good luck finding that." My position is that nobody should be treated that way. Your position is that as a Nazi, you'll be a victim if I'm treated like a human being. Could you be more entitled?

If you're not aware of the media conglomerate's hostility to White racial consciousness and the well being of White people in general, then that supposed ashkenazi IQ is doing you no favors. Most likely you know and just play coy. Typical tricks.

And then of course, there's your little N word. Funny that you would assume immediately that I belong to one specific country that ousted their semitic enemies, out of the over 100 that expelled the jews by name. Your petty names have no power here. "If you're treated like a human being." Hilarious strawman, retard. I expected better. If you were held to the same standard as we are, Zionism would be a federal crime instead of the most corrupt and monied corporate and government agenda in the world. How's that for being treated like a human being?

&gt;tWitTer'S aNTiSemiTiSm PrOBLeM.

Do you get banned from Twitter for trying to bring attention to crimes committed against jewish women? For celebrating jewish history? No? Then shut the fuck up, kikel. Get in line.

&gt;Scapegoat for your failures

I'm living the dream. And with regard to women specifically, they have been abundant to the point of annoyance. You're just objectively wrong. Such an ignorant race smh.

&gt;jewish plots to get black men on top of white women

Probably because Mindgeek and its subsidiaries are entirely owned and operated by jews lmao. The entire porn industry literally consists of jews trying to get black men on top of white women. That's no theory.

&gt;You attack others who've never done a moment's harm

Holodomor. Just to name one of many. Filthy rat.

&gt;You're a sorry excuse for a man

Says the inbred rat lmao post physique

&gt;Oy vey I'm not getting enough validation replies for my genetic schizophrenia! Have I wandered onto the wrong site?

Yes. We are not obligated to humor your hostile delusions. This does not belong to you.</div>

To be wiped off of every avenue for public discourse. Gawd isn't it *terrible* that this is allowed to happen to *you*?? Of all people! Oh my heart goes out to you, you poor abused thing.
