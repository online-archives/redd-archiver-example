When you import people with different values from a different environment, there's gonna be problems. I can sit and post for hours about how these radicals are fucking the West. You'll sit there and tell me it's a small minority. At the last Intelligence community reports,there were 1.2 billion Muslims. Of them, 25% are believed to be radical. 25% of 1.2 billion is 300 million, the same population as the US. Thats a Jihadi fighter for every man woman and child who would happily blow themselves up to kill you.

300 million. And you say they're not a problem, lol.  </div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm back bitch! [The Internet never forgets.](https://prnt.sc/fmfans) Once you post garbage, the it will always be out there. And bro, that's one hell of a "typo".

For anyone else following this retards train of verbal diarrhea, here's the post he deleted.

&gt;Yeah, and your report talks about attacks worldwide...in which case those attacks committed by Muslim terrorists mostly kill...wait for it...waaaaaaait for it...other Muslims.
The majority of victims from Muslim terrorists are actually other Muslims...which again shows they aren't representative of the wider Muslim community.

&gt;Get the fuck out of here with your Muslim apologist attitude. (a quote from my previous post -QQ_L2P)

&gt;Not an apologist, but someone who cares about logic and facts. Try it! Your attitude plays right into the hands of ISIS, congrats ;)


And here's what he changed it to.

&gt;Because in the US it's CLEARLY not the case...and it should be obvious that given geopolitics the majority of attacks happen in Muslim countries given all the wars there. Look up which region of the planet suffers from the most wars right now to figure out why only an idiot wouldn't realize that's the reason most terrorist attacks worldwide are committed by Muslims.
But again, even so, the majority of victims are also Muslims...so there's that. And you are desperately trying to lump those victims in with fundamentalist assholes...which exactly what ISIS wants you to do.

&gt;So congrats for helping ISIS's narrative :/

I mean, he's clearly forgotten that there's an interactive map linked in my last post where he can see all the attacks in the US, and around the world for that matter. If he's actually like to look at facts, like he claims to, he can see who carried out the attacks in the US. But since interactive maps are hard for him, [I'll go ahead and link a wall of text.](https://www.infoplease.com/world/disasters/terrorist-attacks-us-or-against-americans) Should be more his speed.

So thankfully, this retard has demonstrated his inability to challenge **THE FACT** that the majority of terrorists are Muslim. I mean, he'll sit there and excuse it because "muh geopolitical rezuns", but stupid people don't know why they're stupid. And it's a fools errand to expect them to ever have that epiphany.</div>

Pay particular attention to Chart 4 on slide 25 and Slide 13 and 14 under "Attackers" where it states that most of the terrorist attacks that year were conducted by Al Qa'ida. I wonder what religion Al Qa'ida subscribe to. *HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.*

In fact, if you want a run down of all the terrorist attacks in 2016, [go here.](https://storymaps.esri.com/stories/terrorist-attacks/?year=2016) Thankfully, the facts speak for themselves and we don't have to take your word for it.

Get the fuck out of here with your Muslim apologist attitude. If you want to suck their dick you can fuck off to their country and do it embracing their values.</div>
