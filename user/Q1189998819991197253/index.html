Seth Rich isn't nonsense. He was killed by the DNC. They're spouting out the Russian narrative to hide it.

Do you know how big the implications of Rich's death are? Yuuuuge. No, but really. There's a reason they're upping the ante and attempting to cover it up. TD is upping the ante in its investigations as a response. 

We're digging closer and closer, and they're pushing the Russian thing harder and harder. It's no coincidence. </div>

I have a newsflash for you. Don't be scared, but Gen Z is the most conservative generation yet. Conservatism is the new counter culture. You're fucked if you think relying on those scapegoated baby boomers to die is what will have you win.

It's okay. Vent all you like. I'll be here for you. You will come around in time and see that your needless insulting has the effect equivalent of a teenager having a tantrum to his parents. Won't change much. We're all in this together, you know. :)</div>

Hey, I don't need your silly pity. Reality's got my back. We've won the presidency after all. We're in charge. We aren't the ones crying after something we've already lost. I'm happy to let you vent here.

I could spend my time explaining to you- again for the second time - about the censorship thing. I'm not going to waste my time on someone who isn't going to listen, though. That's just silly.

You don't need my respect, no, but you need the rest of America's respect if you wanna win anything or change anything. I don't think attacking them will win them over, boss. But that's just me. You do you.

That all you got? What's next, I wonder.

No matter how you attack me, Trump is in now. He is our president, now. He isn't being impeached. You can hope and pray and attempt to intimidate people trying to live their lives, but it really isn't happening. I know it's hard not to trust CNN, but I believe in you. :)

If it turns out I was wrong, I'd say so. But until  there's empirical evidence *beyond a reasonable doubt*? Haha, not a chance!  Ruthlessly attacking me isn't changing anybody's mind. Proof would, that is if you had some.

I could say the same to you, that you've fallen for the establishment bait. You've spat out all the Democratic talking points, what with the whole "Russian" debacle. I very well would've respected you and your opinion had you refrained from verbally abusing me, but hey. It is what it is. You've pushed people like me and all the rest of the moderates out out out, and now you get to live with the rest of the crazies. You've made your bed now sleep in it.

The more people you attack, the more people who come to us. Think for a moment.

You think he's evil and that he's selling America out for his own gains? I understand mistakenly thinking he's an idiot, but evil? Come on man, you can do better than that. 
Especially if you've said you understand what the alternative was.

The truth is, Americans were sick of the status quo failure that is Obama. We were sick of his high taxes, his economical failures. We knew Hillary would be more of the same. So, we said, what the hell? And picked something new for once. And now you're sitting here and demonizing all of us just for exercising our right to vote. Now that, frankly, sounds more un-American than anything. Keep it up, this is quite fun.

You have every right to call us idiots, and we have every right to keep on trucking the way we always have. We also have the right to ignore you and vote counter to your beliefs.

Sure, you don't need to respect us. Respect is earned. You sure as hell aren't winning anyone's respect over with your internet tantrums, though. Nor are Antifa winning anyone over with their riots. 

You see, most Americans strive for peace. What you are doing is breaking the peace. Most Americans worry about putting food on the table and the economy. They do not give a shit about your political agenda. They don't have time to worry about witch-hunting and McCarthyism. I'm sure you may genuinely think that Trump is in bed with the Russians, but have you ever stopped to think about why that would even be? Why it matters? We influence other elections all the time, as do most first world countries. We play the game. We spy on allied countries. So why are you being so hypocritical, if it's even remotely true? And if it turns out to be false, well...  you're proven to just wanting a scapegoat for all your little problems.

Haha, American Taliban. You're calling a bunch of people shitposting on the internet equivalent to a terrorist organization. Let that sink in. Sounds like we're living in your head rent free.

I try to debate with you and see both sides with you and you attack me. I'm wondering if you will ever clue in as to why people voted for Trump in the first place. I'll give you a hint: it's because we're sick of being attacked by people like you. It's the biggest "Fuck You" in American political history. As for his first few months? They've been great for most of us! Taxes are lowering, economy is blooming. How horrible.

Most of us only care about our economy and safety. We don't care for doomsayers like you.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Huh. I'm the un-American one, when you lot spout threats and lovely messages like this one to people with differing opinions as well as engage in literal McCarthyism and witch-hunting. 

It's so humourous to me that your only response to my reply is to scream and attempt to belittle me. 

Hint: it doesn't work. It will never work. Ad hominems are a flaw, and they show you have no idea what you're talking about. You can scream and shout and yell all you'd like, but you're never going to have the influence over the American people that you want.  People are starting to see you for what you really are: bigots who can't contain themselves and who lust for power. Your screaming that you aren't getting your way supports that fact. 

You are exactly the reason why I left the Democrats. Or, should I say, the *Democrats left me.* You disenfranchised and cannibalized your own moderates and now you reap what you sow.  </div>

This site has a large amount of losers who spend their time brigading and building bots because they hate us that much. I'm not even conservative, by the way. I still get treated like dirt by these idiots who assume that because I'm Pro Free Speech and not rabidly hating on Trump and his supporters I must be an "uneducated hick". You people do not understand that everybody's political opinions are valid and you can agree to disagree.

You can take a look at this thread for an example. 

American Taliban, my ass. You must be thinking of Antifa.

*"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Socialist.*

*Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.*

*Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.*

*Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me*."

You don't need to be on our side politically to understand that censorship is wrong. However, with your insulting and ad hominems it's apparent you'll never listen to reason. I'm done arguing with you.

It's real funny that you think half the nation are uneducated hillbillies. Even funnier that you only think that because they disagree with your opinions. You're actually being bigoted, something leftists tend to push on us. Please learn that everybody has their own valid opinions, even if they cross with yours.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Ugh. You're highly misinformed. Not maliciously, I'll give you that. 

TD banned dissent *because it's specifically not a sub for that.* It's literally a pro Trump rally. We state that in the side bar and redirect to a different sub, /r/AskTrumpSupporters, for debate. It's fucking emboldened in the comment box.

We speak about free speech because *we've* been banned **in places that are supposed to be impartial** such as /r/politics and non political subs. You can see there's a huge difference between the two.

You're really not understanding it. **The admins allowed other subs to use vote manipulation and bots to essentially remove our sub from all, a way to silence our opinion.** Don't you get the implications of this? </div>

Wew. I thought you'd realize, though, that one person doesn't speak for all. We know we're being immature, but it's immaturity prompted by the immature bias and partiality the admins have shown. Enough with the games.
They tried to choke us out like a new Anaconda Plan. They either need to enforce the rules for all or remove them. They're obligated to be *unbiased*.</div>

No, TD never officially brigaded. We banned or removed comments when anyone posted links outside of the sub. Literally had a bot to do so. It was a huge rule. That's why it's such a big deal now, because we are no longer playing by the silly rules the admins placed. They weren't being enforced fairly.

This fiasco was caused by one of our mods rebelling because of the bias the admins have shown, and subsequently being banned for it.

There is a clear bias here, whether you support TD or not. It isn't right no matter what side you're on.

That's not just it. We've had *blatant* vote manipulation against us. No, we can't​ push our stuff to the top naturally anymore. The admins changed their algorithm to specifically target us. 

There was a post the other day by an unbiased user who posted the data of clear and evident botting. It was a steady fucking line. 

There's also the sticky rule that I forgot. First they took away stickies, and then they made them unable to reach all. No other sub had that.</div>

I'm sure there's more but I can't name them off the top of my head, sorry.

All we want is the rules to apply to everyone equally. We're simply fed up with how we've been treated. We've been bashed and had extreme examples of vote manipulation, people banning us just for posting there, actual threats made against us and our mods, etc. Admins did jackshit about it and said *they* were allowed, but we were not. </div>

They've put downvote bots on us to reset our posts to zero. We've been brigaded countless times. 

T_D mods had to comply with special rules that no other sub had to. Admins do nothing to stop the brigading and censorship, so this is the T_D mods' way of saying fuck you to the admins, they they aren't dealing with it anymore.

If they ban T_D as a result we will flood the rest of Reddit and bring it down with us. </div>
