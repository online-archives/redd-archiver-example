<p>Some of them send me email.  They often express frustration, because they are trying to learn Python, or Bayesian Statistics, or Digital Signal Processing.  They are not interested in installing software, cloning repositories, or setting the Python search path!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned to code in the 90s, so my opinion will be colored by that, but i don't see this as a bigger problem than what we had back then.</p>
<p>The install processes have gotten a lot smoother over the years, and you have more languages to pick from with varying difficulty. Want to do PHP? You don't have to set up the trifecta of php, db and apache manually, just download XAMPP and boom, it's done. C#? Visual Studio educational edition is free to download for everyone and works out of the box. Want to have a shot at creating games? Unity. Don't want to install anything? Plenty of JS environments online you can use to execute your code. Want just the basics? You can try those in bash/powershell. Need something more complex? GCC is default in damn near every linux distro. In a lot of instances the complex setup of the environment was reduced to running one file that bootstraps it for you, or even just booting a live cd that has everything you need.</p>
<p>In addition to that new coders these days have access to much more resources, from articles to video tutorials to actual source code. Not to mention lowering of one barrier that seems to be omitted - the admission fee in form of buying a computer. You can get a laptop for 200 bucks, even cheaper if used. Sure it'll be a piece of shit, but perfectly capable of running basic programs.</p>
<p>I always took setting up the environment to be very much a part of programming. I also always found it to be the easiest part. The &quot;i can't learn how to code because i can't set up the environment&quot; seems like nothing but a convenient excuse. </p>
<p>It's true that programming in general has gotten more complex. More languages, more libraries, more everything. But you don't need any of that to learn basic concepts. If anything i see the barrier of entry being a lot lower, not higher.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I've first seen this idea about a decade ago, and i can't believe that it actually survived to this day. The whole concept is retarded and never worked no matter which way you slice it.</p>
<p>My biggest issue is that programming - as in the actual typing of the code - is fairly simple and straight forward, coming up with solutions is hard. Why in the fuck would you need someone to watch you type. If it's an experienced dev - he knows how to do it, if it's an inexperienced one - he wont learn dick just by watching. He needs to type it himself, fuck it up, fix it, rinse and repeat. In this case a code review has the same effect with a fraction of time spent.</p>
<p>Part of becoming a dev is learning how to deal with issues on your own, how to find information, how to go about learning something you know nothing about etc. You're not going to learn that by watching someone with 15 years experience just churning out the code off the top of his head. The only thing this encourages is leaning on the senior devs for every little problem.</p></div>

Because it's pretty commonplace that if a guy for a 60-80 offer asks for 80 without having the skills to warrant it, he's not getting the job. Doesn't mean the offer gets pulled from the market though, just that the guy isn't getting it.</p></div>

<p>Long answer: You have no bargaining chips and nothing to win other than a couple of extra bucks. Don't be greedy, take the low paying job and wait a year. After that, you can reassess your situation by checking other offers and either asking for a raise or leaving the company for a more lucrative position.</p>
