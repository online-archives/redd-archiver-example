I already explained it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/9lllcl/i_was_banned_from_rsoccer_for_a_supposed_sexist/e77vltw/

I've already seen your point because a few of you took your time to communicate and clarify what happened and listened to my claim. I already understand it and justified why I was acting the way I did to the best of my abilities. I completely understand why the ban was issued now.

I also didn't know of the existence of /r/soccercourt.

Again, I'm truly sorry. Keep up the work.</div>

I am truly sorry. I clearly made a big mess about the whole situation and it just made it even worse for me. I was completely ignorant on these matters.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I had never been banned before, I didn't know what the process usually is. After trying to understand what caused it I went online to see how long the ban was for and I reached the conclusion that it was probably a permanent ban pretty quickly, that made me nervous about it since I first believed only the mod who was conversing with me was able to see my case and I felt like no one else could hear my case. That's why I contacted the mod team, but I felt that it took so long to get clear answers. At the time I really didn't understand the reason behind the ban. I didn't even think of not doing anything and wait a little bit before contacting the mod team.

As I said, I'm truly sorry. I've seen those threads now and the shitshow you have to deal with. I really did. 

Again, I apologize. Keep up the work.</div>

I don't know if it's because english is not my first language and I lack a certain sensibility to correctly express the true meaning of what I'm writing, but I'll stray away from these types of posts anyways.

If in the future you decide to give me another chance, please do let me know. I quite love participating on that subreddit and it's definitely my favorite way of watching matches, to have the match thread opened and to comment the games alongside the other users. I can't promise I'll be able to follow the second account rule, but I can definitely promise that I won't make any posts that can be interpreted in such a toxic, terrible way, ever again.

I'm sorry I called your team names, I was legitimately furious since I hate the idea of having my reddit account, where I have all my interests, and saved posts attached to, for so long now completely nullified from having my main subreddit removed. That couple with what I honestly felt like a very aggressive way of communicating with me made me lose it a bit. I apologize for it and hope you can continue to fulfill your collective of objective of steering that amazing subreddit in the right way.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yes, but since I clearly had trouble finding the misogynistic remark and since I'm pretty sure I posted more than once in some of those topics I was not sure which comment it was. I think it was the Neymar one which I already edited and removed the original words. I find rape disgusting and I'm positive I said several times that if Ronaldo is guilty he should pay the price.

I took the time to write that post on /r/RedditCensors because I was told to go there by a mod of another subreddit I frequently use /r/Portugal. I didn't know the origins of that subreddit but I now understand that it is mainly used by /r/The_donald trolls who got rightly banned from other subreddits. If I'd known that from the beginning I would try to find another outlet. It's just that I genuinely felt no one was being clear with me from the /r/soccer mod team.  

I tried to explain my point. I'd never go to such lengths if I had indeed meant any ill opinions with my post. The post which I think was the one that caused the ban has been edited accordingly anyways. If I indeed offended any one of you, then I apologize, I just ask that you understand why I was pissed off and why I called you what I did.</div>

I'll have you know that I could not see your username, it was displayed as null, how do you expect me to know.

I was rightly pissed off at having an account banned from one of my most used subreddits, I think it is normal. I don't know if most users actually take their time, like I did, to express their case. I'm willing to bet not that many. My reaction that you portray, and rightfully so, as abuse was prompted by this reason.</div>

Even then if I wrote it, I'm the one who knows exactly what it is supposed to mean. It means exactly what I said. Criticizing people who try to use the rich and famous for a paycheck. 

Please be free to dissect it and find the sexism in there. I showed this to several women and they laughed at it. Not everyone is from the USA where anything with the word 'girl' in it is instantly sexist. You are the reason things like this are happening, you are disrupting the definition of these terms.

Please, do tell me. Then switch the characters in the phrase and think again.

You also don't speak for every single user of /r/soccer so get off your high horse. 'We don't need to tolerate'. Fucking hell.</div>

I'm trying to do the good thing here and thoroughly present my defense. I've already spent far too much time arguing against a subreddit ban but I do feel like I was not properly communicated with. I could've just used another account and keep commenting, but I'm trying to present my case and be fairly judged by all of you in order to be removed of this ban.
