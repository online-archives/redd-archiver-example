Republican voters are voting for the politicians and they aren't being represented?!?!?! sounds likes you're getting to it, and that we need to reach out to the apathetic non-voters, and the dissuaded red voters in red states with those red politicians, so that we can get more dems in the senate and not be reliant on 2 of 50, but have an actual majority of younger faced dems.

Things don't change overnight, especially after these last few decades, and if you haven't been paying attention this has been going on for a bit, pragmatism is gonna get you farther than sitting out and letting republicans win because you weren't happy enough with what you felt the democrats should have done.</div>
