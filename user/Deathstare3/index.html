The above link is a 10 verse spread surrounding your quote of 9:30.

From this, you can gather that Allah does not like people attributing "Godliness" to anyone other than Him. As in Islam, shirk (polytheism: The act of having multiple Gods) is the biggest sin of all and the punishment for it is Hellfire. Now, you may be saying, "Gotcha! it's violent indeed!" but keep in mind hellfire is a punishment in a lot of religions.

Christianity has the phrase, "Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord an Savior" (lest ye burn in Hellfire)

The Jewish faith also believes in Hellfire, so the concept of punishment is not exclusive to one religion.

Onto the violent part that you highlighted, "May Allah destroy them". It seems violent doesn't it? However, if you see a crime committed, would you not say, "Let the judge handle it"? We say, "let the judge handle it" and not "let the judge destroy them" because judges do not have the divine power of omnipotence, so the party in question could still be innocent.

Before God, there is not doubt, so a certainty in judgment is understandable. Now, the sentence, "May Allah destroy them" is also telling Muslims to back off. It's not their job, duty, or responsibility to confront disbelievers or polytheists. God will handle it.

&gt; 2:190 Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.

Fight those who fight you, but fight only in defense. Do not impose yourselves on them. Do not take more than you lost.

&gt;2:192 And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

Once again, fight for defense, not spoils of war.

&gt;2:193 Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah . But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.

Fight the aggressors until they either convert to your religion, or until they cease oppressing your people.

https://quran.com/2/190-200

This passage is about war against an oppressive force. An army has occupied a Muslim nation. Other Muslim nations are instructed by God to greet them in battle and "Expel them from wherever they have expelled you"

&gt; And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.

Al-Masjid Al-Haram is a holy site. Most of you will recognize it as the Kabba, in Mecca. This statement is forbidding fighting in this holy site, but allowing self defense if others attempt to attack you there.

God sends down this message as a direct command. You must free your brothers and sisters from oppression. These oppressing nations conquered lands by attacking small nations one at a time, while talking diplomacy with other nations. Their motto you may have heard before, and which this verse is meant to be a direct counter to: "Divide and Conquer"

Allah is saying "Unite and Defend yourselves"

I pulled my source from Quran.com, which is an unbiased translation of the Quran. You pulled your quotes from a website dedicated to painting Islam in a bad light. I'd be hard pressed to believe that site has any interest in scholarly dissection of the Quran.

**This comment thread was literally talking about context when it came to quoting something, so I figured you'd attempt not to slap standalone verses here**</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Yeah, I was also skeptical when I saw him pull all his negative comments from hadith.

It's literally the word of God (Quran) vs the word of man (Hadith)

A hadith, in Islam, is a proverb that is so profound that it is widely spread around. As you may have gathered, the proverb is contained in the timeframe of that society, as is a direct response to the situation in that time.

If there were to be a hadith in this time, it would be along the lines of

"Do not greet the men of America first, and if there are multiple paths, choose the better path for yourself."

You may think, oh! this is negative. Remember, however, that Muslim countries are currently occupied and under attack by American soldiers.

So, in light of the wars being fought, the most negative thing the hadith says is to not say hello first, and to make sure you take the easier road?

That's my take on it though.

I'd hope his comment goes higher up though because he makes some sound points.</div>
