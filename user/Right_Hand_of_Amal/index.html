The scale ranges from anarcho-capitalism to right-libertarianism. If you had even a vague understanding of the political compass, you would know that conservatism and authoritarianism are different things. 

Of course, I can't say I'm surprised that some random person who gets their news from page 1 of Google may not actually engage in debate. If you want to stay in your own world believing that you are more intelligent th an anyone else, than more power to you, but never engage in a debate if you don't want to hear the response.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">When I say life begins at conception, that means that at conception, the unborn is in all ways human. It has a unique DNA set that differentiates it from its parents. Before viability, it develops most organs that are the same as all other humans like fingers, brains, lungs, and hearts. The thought that it isn't human until it's viable is ridiculous because what is it before then. The libertarian stance would be to go with the constitution on this one, which says all humans have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Otherwise, you have anarchy. 

Russia having such significant military capabilities makes them an extreme risk. You say they won't use them, but you can't know that. The problem is that they can, and therefore, if your goal is to protect Americans, then don't piss off the people who could kill millions instantly. You're conflating isolationist beliefs with libertarianism, which don't always go hand in hand.

Trump wants to leave NATO since our "allies" haven't been paying their part of the defense funding, draining American resources, while they've constantly relied on our military might and superpower status for their own conflicts. Again, if your goal is the benefit of Americans, than not having an alliship that takes drains over 800 million dollars per year would be the libertarian move, unless they can offer us a significant benefit worth that much money, which they currently don't.

Trump is against the border bill because it doesn't do anything. It allows us to close the border only if the encounters surpasses an average of 5 thousand per day or 8500 in one day, giving Mayorkas or the DHHS head the ability to choose to restrict the border. Which can be overruled by the president for 90 days per year. Meaning it doesn't help the issue at all and just costs us absurd amounts of money while increasing more government power, which isn't very libertarian. Perhaps read the bill before claiming that he just "doesn't want to give a win to Biden."

And here again, you prove you've done little to no research and just listen to political pundits. Though first, having a government isn't authoritarian, nor is having limited regulatory power. Ron and Trump aren't libertarian because they are conservative, they also aren't enemies of the state because their goals don't have ramifications that will hurt the people or remove freedoms. The policies you're implying remove books featuring graphic sexual topics or images from elementary and middle schools and disallow sexual acts in public, respectively. It's removing obscene books from children in the school system, not banning books, and stopping kids and the public from seeing obscene things like full nudity and sex as happens in pride parades, not banning people from being gay generally. I'm not an authoritarian, I'm a conservative, and you're not a libertarian, you're practically a leftist. And much like other leftists, you fail to see reality and instead aim for a pie in the sky utopian vision of politics that will ultimately end in anarchy.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">How are they enemies of the state? Because they didn't defend the military? Trump gave us good tax cuts, which libertarians like and at least seems to want to reduce governmental power in some way. Ron was more establishment, but didn't campaign on infringing on anyone's rights either, aside from abortion, which you admit is a non-religious position. Though both did first say they want that power delegated to the states, which limits overall government power and is pretty libertarian. Fundamentally, though, there has never been a right to end a life as that is the first of the major inalienable rights, and by all definitions an unborn infant is a human, and therefore has a human life and thosw inalienable rights.

You can't ignore Russia as a leader of the free world. Supporting them slightly puts us in a better position than being their enemies, though, even if what they are doing is atrocious. Supporting them isn't authoritarian because it doesn't mean that we think what they are doing is the right thing, but that we'd rather be on their good side. We'd have no allies if we only worked with countries that wanted to have all the freedoms we give our people.

Libertarians have a horrible propensity for thinking about things one-dimensionally which is why every major policy from open borders to nearly abolishing the government broad-writ would be horrible for the people. I don't think the government should be as powerful as it is of course, but the degrees to which even the Misus wants to go is insane and will end up getting us invaded by China or Russia by completely shoring up our military and relocating the resources to other things. There is nuance that they love to ignore, like how we may benefit from things that aren't perfect.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Ron AFAIK just called for supporting our allies, and to absolutely avoid boots on the ground. Trump started no new wars and has shown no inclination to do so in the future, he was trying to get us out of the wars we were in, though he was blocked at every turn which ultimately resulted in Biden's pullout which killed more than a dozen Marines. Though his rhetoric in regards to Russia has been bad recently, we have no reason to support Ukriane anyway since they aren't allies and it's hurting Americans.

When it comes to enemies of the state, you can't compare them to any of these leftist.</div>
