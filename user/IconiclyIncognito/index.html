Order of operations. You haven't answered the questions I asked that came before yours. So no I will not participate in your unethical deflections.

He hasn't done any of these things and he has done many things that to me would point to low intelligence, like not understanding his own statements, misusing terms, generalizing to widely, and more.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">They have worked to expand definitions of what is considered sexual assault or rape. They have worked to increase protections for survivors including being able to terminate their leases with protection, they have increased funding to testing rape kits, they have removed exemptions for domestic violence that allowed abusers to receive less severe punishments for assaulting a partner than they would if they assaulted a stranger and more. They have reduced loop holes that allowed marital rape to not be viewed as a crime. 

But you think these things are nothing. Why? Because they also believe that people who are not proven in court to be criminals have a right to bail?  Do you not believe in "innocent until proven guilty"?</div>
