    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">[linkgum.com](https://linkgum.com)

This morning I found this subreddit (from the r/science post that blew up) and figured I’d share here as I believe most of you, like me, hate the censorship they see on reddit. (Although of course there are few decent mods here as they let proper discussion happen from what I see.)

From mods deleting your post for whatever reason they pick out of a hat, to moderators getting bribed by whoever to ensure certain posts don’t get troubled on their way to the top, to the little stupid message mods starting using now when a post gets picked up on r/all where they talk about all the rules of their subreddit in a stickied comment. 

It literally drives me crazy because as a long time reddit-user the main thing that attracted me the most to reddit was the freedom of speech and the free-flowing discussion. What also bothers me is that no one seems to give a shit - the way r/news and all the other subreddits are just pure Trump-hate with no actual reasoning is super frustrating - and I am not even a Trump-lover or anything - I think his presidency has just started and we need to watch how things play out. I really have liked Bernie for a while. Was bummed on how he let Hillary sort-of walk all over him. Either way - that’s my point - it’s like because the left’s ability to freely post hasn’t been compromised they don’t give a shit about the bigger censorship issue on reddit. Wait until for whatever reason their shit starts getting removed they are going to freak.

Well, I feel the way I do, and I’m a developer by trade, so I decided to do something about it instead of just thinking to myself, “Wow, it would be great if there was a reddit without subreddit moderators“. So I just built it myself. I don’t even care if it becomes anything - I just want people to have a place to post what they want.

On Linkgum when you create a subject (subreddit) you do not become some kind of holy ruler - you just created a subject. You are not a special moderator or whatever. Also, there are not other mods - people just report spam and I go and remove the spam.

Of course - because I’m the only admin that raised some concern. My actions need to be watched - but as far as that goes - just watch how I act and decide for yourself if I’m acting in free speech’s best interest. There’s also a transparency log that captures my actions when I remove a post because of spam or whatever.

Listen - I’m the same as most of you - me saying all this means I must be full of shit. To be honest I’m not too keen on doing marketing for it because if the community doesn’t want it then whatever - they won’t use it. But - I at least wanted to provide an place where people can speak with the content moderation on reddit - and I figured I’d share it here.

I wouldn’t be opposed to a subreddit using linkgum as a temporary meeting ground so they can speak without their usual moderators - I think that would be a cool use of [linkgum](https://linkgum.com).

Please share if you like it and think it’s worth sharing.</div>
