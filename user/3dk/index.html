    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>That was the most god-aweful garbage article about programming, I've ever read. It reads like the results of a journalist doing a JavaScript tutorial, then quitting halfway, then googling and regurgitating random shit from wikipedia. That was the worst explanation of compilers I've ever seen. The section about methods was was hilarious and the most obvious giveaway that the author has no fucking clue. There were some retarded grammar mistakes throughout the entire piece. I felt dumber after reading it. Of course it's written by a woman. This article has to be flamebait...</p>
<p>I'm no master programmer either, but when someone clearly doesn't know shit, but pretends like they're smart, it's cringeworthy and pathetic.</p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I've always had great battery life, but since that's just anecdotal, I decided to do a bit more searching and share my understanding of things...</p>
<p>Battery life depends on your usage and on the kernel. &quot;Stock android&quot; is the regular AOSP kernel+OS without optimal configuration for your phone. This can drain your battery. When compiling Android, it's possible to add configurations to optimize battery usage and performance for a specific phone. Phone manufacturer's do this to some extent with the kernel+OS preinstalled on their phones (then usually they add google and other bloatware).</p>
<p>For any supported phone, People involved with Lineage OS compile a kernel with optimizations for that phone (+ the rest of the OS to go with it). For the most part, I'm sure those people have some idea what they are doing and the kernel should be fine performance/battery wise.</p>
<p>You can compile a kernel with your own configurations and add a custom ROM. Maybe this way it's possible to squeeze a bit more out of your phone (performance by overclocking; battery by putting the phone in a &quot;deeper sleep&quot; when not in active use by limiting CPU cycles, signals etc.) but it sounds like a whole lotta effort to find out what do actually do with potential to brick your phone. You can also find custom kernels that other people have created, just look up &quot;yourPhone custom kernel&quot; and you should be able to find stuff on XDA and other sites, where surely bad kernels would be pointed out by otgers and removed.</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother with the effort, but it seems good to know that's an option. Even if the battery usage was slightly worse by the kernel... you certainly gain battery by limiting background activity for apps and removing google + other bloatware. Regardless of battery, the removal of cancer and the buttery smooth experience I've had so far with Lineage are what make it totally worth it, in my experience. The installation is a little tricky, but after that it's smooth sailing.</p>
<p>If you aren't convinced on Lineage:</p>
<p><a href="[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions#Table_of_ROMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_custom_Android_distributions#Table_of_ROMs)">Here's a list of custom ROMs.</a> If you look at the number of supported devices, you'll see why Lineage is popular... Supposedly Copperhead has more of a security focus (at the expense of usability probably) and Resurrection Remix (based on Lineage) is even more configurable (but do you really want more buttons?).</p>
<hr />
<p>Again Disclaimer to prevent disappointment: first wait for your warranty to expire + check if your bootloader is unlockable.</p></div>

    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>First of all your phone's bootloader needs to be unlockable. Check that this is the case. If it is then continue, if not, you're shit outta luck.</p>
<p>If installing a custom ROM voids your phone's warranty, then I would wait, until your warranty expires.</p>
<p>If your warranty has already expired, then I would highly recommend it. For me it's been running smoothly since it was Cyanogenmod. The idiot calling them &quot;script kiddies&quot; misses the point (I would like to hear how he uses his phone)... Cyanogenmod tried to commercialize and the main technical guy jumped ship to start lineage when the writing was on the wall, leaving the faggot CEO to drown in his wreckage. Lineage has avoided commercialization so far and seems dedicated to staying free and open-source. If not... well then there will be the another fork.</p>
<p>The good thing about it is that it allows you to completly remove anything from Google, as far as I can tell. Don't add google stuff, since that defeats the purpose. So no no google play store, no google play services. Install F-Droid for some useful apps, I'd recommend: 
- Amaze file browser
- Simple Calendar
- Simple Music Player
- FOSS Browser
- Markor (Markdown text editor)
- keepassDX (password manager)
- NewPipe (YouTube player and downloaded)
- Termux (for messing around with a terminal on your phone, you can actually write and run scripts to do stuff)
- The only good games are Shattered Pixel Dungeon, Solitaire and Chess
- Yalp store</p>
<p>OK so as you might have noticed the apps available through F-Droid don't quite cover everything... That's what Yalp store is for, it let's you download stuff from Google play store without needing a google account or google play services installed (some apps need it anyway, but I don't use any of those, so I don't care. There is a project that attempts to spoof google play services, but I haven't bothered with that). This is how I get the navigation apps &quot;Here&quot; (better for driving) and &quot;OSMAnd&quot; (better for hiking/cycling) which allow for offline map downloads. Then I begrudgingly download WhatsApp to communicate with normies compromising my entire setup (I keep the fucker off most of the time, I tell people it's to save bettery)... But at least no Google!</p>
<p>Follow the lineage wiki for your phone model to install. If you have installed an OS before or used the commandline, it should be easy, otherwise just go step-by-step, maybe watch a tutorial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it safe? And faster?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply yes. I get security updates that I wouldn't receive from the phone manufacturer. Without the google cancer my 4 year old phone works better than the first day I got it. My impulse for installing Cyanogenmod was when I noticed how my phone wouldn't work properly without google shit. It feels satisfying to remove that cancer and and regain a bit of independence.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>You will quickly realize that beginner tutorials won't help you learn anything new. The way to go is to test your skills at coding challenge sites, I'd reccommend CodeWars and HackerRank. Get good books for stuff you want to learn. Find open-source projects that you like and try to understand their code. Try to make a program for whatever ideas pop into your head. Don't worry too much about best practices, just try to pick them up over time.</p></div>

Libre Office isn't quite as nice, but it's free and it can do almost anything that MS O. can. It just takes some getting used to, prepare to spend some time looking up how to use it.</p>
<p>With steam you can actually back-up a game installation to an eternal storage device to save yourself from downloading it again. Then you can restore the game from your new PC. <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8794-yphv-2033">Follow this guide</a>. This backup feature doesn't back your game saves. You need to copy those over seperately, check where the location of savegame and config data is on <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tekken_7#Game_data">pcgamingwiki</a> put those files in the same directory on your new PC.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>This is barely related to programming, but I'll still try to explain a few things that others haven't. Your question is vague, so my answer will be broad with the aim of giving you a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>If you buy software, you are buying a license to use it which can be sold to you under various terms. You may have bought only one license to install the software, then you wouldn't be able to transfer it. Some software you buy allows you to install it on multiple machines. Software can also be free and then you are allowed to install it on as many machines as you like. It all depends on the fine print in the license that most people don't read which can later on bite them in the ass...</p>
<p>That is the licensing side of things, but then there is also the technical side. Often commercial software will have measures in place to prevent you from simply copying it to another PC, for example it will require you to login to an account, or require activation with a code. Collectively, all these sorts of measures are called digital rights management (DRM). It can enforce some of terms stated in the license. DRM-free software is software where you can copy the installer on any compatible machine to install it without restrictions. DRM-free software can be paid for, for example GoG.com sells games like this. DRM can sometimes prevent a user from accessing software they paid for. For example what happens when the server to check for an account doesn't exist anymore? Access denied.</p>
<p>Since it sounds like you are on windows... If you want to move software between PCs, usually you will need the installer for that software. If you have it, just copy it over and run it again. If you don't have it, you will need to get it again from the website of the software distributer. For most programs on windows just copying files around won't work because of the registry and because you don't know where the installer put stuff anyway. Discovery and distribution of software on windows has always sucked and involves tediously searching around on the internet. Too bad microsoft have such a strong foothold, yet is so shitty.</p>
<p>Apple is even worse, you pay them extra to get fucked good with weak hardware for the price and even worse lock-in. </p>
<p>Linux can be shitty in its own special ways, but is still worth learning with all the free software (libre office, gimp, VLC, etc.) that typically goes along with the OS.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Don't just memorize the syntax of some language without understanding the meaning. Try understanding the underlying concepts: data types, control flow, object-oriented programming (oop), SQL databases, etc. A programming language is just a way to implement these things, python is fine, don't worry about that. You won't understand everything immediately. You can skip topics a bit, but try remembering what you don't know, keep looking stuff up to fill in the gaps, until things start making sense.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should know why HTML isn't a programming language and what CSS and JavaScript are... now all you need to do to get started with web development is you need to use apache webserver on some network-capable machine and pick a server-side backend that generates webpage content and serves it and optionally some kind of framework front end thing that makes your pages look good with dynamic content.</p>
<p>After you have done a couple tutorials, you will find that more beginner tutorials will be pretty useless. You need to move on to coding challenge sites (coding challenge, code wars, hacker rank), read programming  books and actually look at some projects on github, codeproject, etc. and think of your own things to work on.</p>
<p>Also install Linux and learn some bash command line and scripting.</p></div>

<p>I think that's rather encouraging. In what other line of work can you learn for a year and then start at an entry-level position that lets you work from home? Programming isn't a get rich quick thing, but with hard work and skill, it can get you places. That's opportunity.</p></div>
