    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; Of course, but I don't believe rise of anti-Mainland China posts is enough to suspect US govt involvment.


It's up to you to speculate. For some, a Chinese tech company investing in Reddit also isn't enough to suspect Chinese govt involvement (Before you say that the company is involved in censorship, realize first that the the company was forced by the Chinese government to allow them access to the company's chat service. It is not even remotely the same case as an investment in a foreign-based company which you don't actually own).

&gt; China makes worrying moves and people getting worried about it is more reasonable explanation than US govt spamming reddit, especially the more left-leaning subreddits which despite being against many Mainland China policies still would prefer non-interventionist approach. Not to mention spamming often makes people care less, it's better to post fewer but bigger stories.

Sorry, but you're kind of talking out of your ass. Of course, we're all speculating here on little information, but this is nonsensical. I don't know if people don't have the same historical knowledge or if their memory is fading, but claims like this have always been pushed and spread by the American media, even with little to no evidence backing it up. This idea that the US government would push such a narrative is not only realistic, it should be *expected* at this point.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Right, I understand that this sentiment is for the good of human rights. But if your gripe is with China manipulating Reddit to push a narrative, then you should have an equal suspicion of countries like the United States who can do the exact same thing.

We live in a world of politics where it can be quite irrelevant if something is 'right or wrong'. Governments can and will manipulate any situation to improve their own standing in the world. 

Yes, anti-China posts are positive. But if they are manipulated by let's say the United States for the expansion of their own power then it should be treated with the exact same disdain. We should keep the political narrative as balanced as we possibly can. If you start straying off then it just becomes propaganda benefiting nobody but the state in question.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't agree with the censorship of the post, but he does make a good point about this whole China brigade. The way /r/pics was hijacked by anti-China sentiment was very propaganda-like, yet practically nobody questions if they're also the subject of manipulation.

I understand that people are trying to keep Reddit in check, but flooding the website with anti-China posts is EQUALLY destructive to its integrity. By the way, recent reports are saying that the Uyghur musician is still alive, so maybe it's best to get some fact-checking done before you rush to shit out as many post you can about China.</div>
