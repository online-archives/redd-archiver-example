What she doesn’t understand is that the entire reason for Python’s popularity hinges on getting up and running quickly. </p>
<p>Her perspective is also from someone wanting to maintain support for Python 2-only libraries, but they’ve had a literal decade to upgrade. </p>
<p>Also, wanting to transform a language ecosystem into the clusterfuck that Nodejs has allowed to flourish just staggers me. JS has succeeded because everyone doing web development has to know it, not because of the package repository structure.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/1866696#9744845">Pros/Cons of Voat Cost Saving Measure: Compress comment chains into a single db record</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I think it's a really bad idea to consider doing this. You're actually gaining nothing via this method and may actually be introducing significant processing overhead. You would be better off setting up a caching mechanism and using redis or memcachedb to store prerendered html snippets for the most often accessed parent comments, which itself is pretty substantial. I won't delve into those details though.</p>
<p>I'll deal with your pros one-by-one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less server load to build the comment trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless you're caching, as I've already mentioned, then you'd likely end up with higher load. Not on the DB, mind you, but on the web server from parsing the comment(s) string. Sure, you probably have a plan to make it as well-formed and regular as possible to work around that, but you're still taking processing from one place and putting it where you really can't afford it. Very likely, you could get better improvement by optimizing the query grabbing the comments. And yeah, I do mean one and only one query.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less DB space used</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you sure about that? Have you calculated the amount of disk space you'd save per record on this? How about the amount you'll need trying to shoehorn the old features back in when the community calls you a niggerfaggot kike cock muncher for removing features to try and save a few bytes like they're fucking shekels?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less API calls on voting up/down comments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you're removing functionality that the site needs, which the community will not stand for, with only the vague notion that this will actually help. Seriously, I'm pretty sure that bandwidth is more of a problem than saving a little disk space.</p>
<p>If space is a real concern, maybe we should play with the idea of deleting comment threads that don't meet an upvote threshold after 3 months until you come back with numbers that can be checked. <a href="https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server-data-types-reference/">Here are data type sizes in SQL Server to help you get started.</a> If voat is using MySQL or something similar at this point then I'm sure a similar table is also available.</p></div>

            Comment on: <a href="../../v/programming/comments/1417752#7021704">For those who went from one language to another that were wildly different, how did it work out? Any advice/tips?</a>
        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I've went from C# to Perl to Ruby to Groovy/Java to Swift and currently transitioning to C. I can say with certainty that Java has earned a special amount of hatred in a corner of my heart. The tooling sucks, the documentation is haphazard (some of it good, the rest is a fucking minefield), the memory management and configuration for the tasks we used it for was a nightmare, and good luck finding validation for use cases.</p>
<p>We were using it to script things in JMeter, so that probably had a lot to do with it. I much preferred Groovy, but it's even worse on the memory side of things. The more modern JVM is much better about things but if you're confined to 1.7 then good luck. Also, each Java process needs to be kept to &lt;= 500 threads or bad things happen, which we didn't really know at the time. Really, this is why it's good to have one or two team members with really deep knowledge about a platform.</p>
<p>I think the language is less of an issue than the target platform honestly. So long as you have good library and framework support the language barely matters.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>C# is more closely related to Java than C++. It's easier deal with than either of those in my opinion, but that's really up to personal preference. Up until recently you were locked into Microsoft's playground if you wanted to use it with any real support, the Mono project notwithstanding, so a lot of people have avoided it for that reason. I can't really blame them given Microsoft's tendency to hold out an olive branch only to shoot you if you go to grab it.</p></div>
