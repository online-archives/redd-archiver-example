If I recall correctly, reveddit doesn't work very well for edited and deleted comments.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I disagree for the most part because I find commercial pizza sauces to typically be on the sweet side of things. So having a regular deliverable chain pizza with pineapple and probably a soda to drink along side it is typically sweetness overload for me. I might as well be eating dessert instead.

The caveat is that I can change up the balance of the pizza with the use of different toppings or sauces. It might not sound that appetizing, but if I'm really feeling like having pineapple on pizza and I'm ordering from somewhere that hasn't thought this stuff out, then a cream sauce, garlic, something spicy, and a combination of meats saltier than just ham is the easiest combination I can think of to counter the sweetness and tartness of pineapple. I don't mind its sweetness, but I just want a side note of it, and not want sweet to dominate my palate.</div>

&gt; Low-effort posts (trolls, **treating the sub like Google etc**) will be deleted. Repeat/**egregious offenders** will be banned. If you have a simple question, your first stop should be Google, not here.

You could have easily Google'd something like "do westerners travel to asia for martial arts training", and be met with pages of people that have done this exact thing, proving that, yes, people do indeed travel to Asia for this reason.

Secondly, even if you say you weren't trying to be racist, your post does come off as ignorantly racist. You're in the Japan subreddit asking a question about martial arts, as if all Japanese people know martial arts. ~~The "All Asians know Martial Arts" trope surely isn't real, HAHAHA.~~ At least in my head, this looks like an egregious offense, and you got banned for it. This question was better off in a martial arts subreddit, not an ethnic/national one.

Edit: Also, IMO, this post is better off in the Banned subreddit. This does not feel like a RedditCensors post.</div>

As for this particular ban itself, I agree that it was not a fair ban. But I don't exactly see how your negative sentiment of said community lines up with your written history in said same community.</div>

You think the community was mostly hate groups and hard-right group types that were misleading a small number of lambs.

I think the community was mostly genuine, albeit formed out of retaliation, with said retaliation attracting a decent amount of bad apples (hateful anti-LGBTQ-idon'tknowtheentirething types, false-flaggers, etc).

I don't think we're going to convince each other even if we were to continue to argue/talk.

I will agree with you that there were some number of unfavorables within the SuperStraight community, though my number is probably much smaller than yours. "There will always be a few bad apples."

But what the fuck, "the pot calling the kettle black" much? This "movement" wouldn't have even happened if the toxic and vocal branch of the trans community didn't call "super straight" people transphobic for excluding said transpeople from their sexual preferences. Basically in your words, "transpeople investing this much time harassing 'super straight' people over what they do with their bodies".

I've already said, "I believe all people should be allowed to be picky about whom they pursue romantic/sexual relationships with." Despite the bad apples, I believe that there were a lot of actually genuine folk within the Super Straight community. But whatever, you don't want to see that. There are no shades of gray for you. All you want to do is see the world is black and white. I choose to agree to disagree, and leave it there.</div>

1. ...claiming to have been censored by the mods here, but not providing me with proof when I asked you to do so? In case you don't remember, but this is r/RedditCensors. It wouldn't be the first time that someone claimed that some mod somewhere censored then, but they've all provide some modicum of proof with some sort of screenie. The thought that you're a fraud wouldn't have even formed if you provided some sort of proof in the first place.

2. ...starting out by saying something like

&gt; shit like this is gonna get you guys a free brick wall when the day comes.

but at the same time, in your DMs claiming that

&gt; I live in one of the most “sjw” places in America and lemme tell you no one has ever, ever given me shit for not being into dudes and being in a hetero relationship with a cis woman. **People don’t fucking care.**

So which is it? Because it looks you do seriously care that much about what other people do in their homes. Why do you care so much if the people around you don't care?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Okay, I'm willing to talk.

So, what exactly did you think the SuperStraight movement was?

I thought something retaliatory like this was eventually going to happen, after a decent while of the more-vocal-and-toxic parts of the trans community calling straight people that did not wanting to engaging in romantic/sexual relationships "transphobes". If I really wanted to be petty, I could flip the script back to the trans community and question if they are being "cisphobic" with the existence of things like [Nocissexual](https://archive.vn/V95M9) and [Trans Loving Trans](https://archive.vn/JMA2E).

But I won't because I believe all people should be allowed to be picky about whom they pursue romantic/sexual relationships with. Being able to trust someone else with your love and/or their genitals is such an intimate experience, I wouldn't have it any other way.

And just because a straight person isn't romantically/sexually interested in transpeople doesn't mean said straight person can't have amicable and friendly relationships with transpeople in other aspects of life.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; Well how was I supposed to know the rule if it's not put in the **official sub rules**?

First of all, you should have been using your head. Even if you were trying to be funny, perhaps you should have asked yourself, "Will impersonating a mod like this get me in trouble?"

Second, note I said "most online communities". I was trying to imply other communities outside of even reddit, just regular old forums as well that you can find anywhere. This kind of unspoken rule doesn't really need to be stated, it just screams "common sense" to me, no matter where you are on the web.

&gt; Besides, it should have been obvious since I did it as a comment reply rather than as private message like an actual ban message. Plus I told them it was a joke like 2 hours later + there's no [M] next to my name.

Always assume that people are less knowledgeable. Just because you and I know that's usually how it works here doesn't mean AverageJoe-87321 or MarySue-216 also knows that. 

Also, mods can post without mod capacity, without the [M] tag.</div>

u/fastban is a 7 day account, probably made for the purpose of getting fastbanned and pulling this sort of shitty behavior. If he doesn't get what he wants, when can we expect u/fastban2?</div>

I was curious why you didn't show the context. Didn't even have to take a few minute to call you own on this BS.

This is r/conservative's [rules](https://imgur.com/YpygkDv). Note their rule 5, and their examples and section on shit posting.

And here is your [comment](https://imgur.com/X01zDAn), with additional context to show that this is you.

At least you're true to your name, but don't complain about getting unfairly banned when there is literally a rule on this listed on their sidebar, with a link to shit post examples going to the rules page I listed.</div>
