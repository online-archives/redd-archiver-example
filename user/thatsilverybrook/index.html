It’s weird watching hitler 2.0 in real time and being able to do nothing about it. The judges treated hitler like this too and it made people doubt the courts and garnered more support for hitler allowing him to take control.

If you think like this you have some kind of disorder imo.</div>

Thats what tds is. It’s just hearing his name that makes your brain freak out and make up childish names and act like he’s hitler or some other hyperbole. “Tangerine shitgibbons”, do you think people who talk like that and immediately think of sniffing underwear for no apparent reason because they hear a name don’t have mental problems? I would argue only an asshat talks like that and Trump and Biden are probably smarter and more able than you.

I can say someone has tds without liking trump and if I did like trump I should be able to say it in a politics sub, that is the point. Try not to have another breakdown.</div>
