all-in-all the thing that Reddit has given me the most insight about by FAR is the how and why of propaganda. 

After this I could go take over a small country and make the people therein think of me as some benevolent god. i'd just do IRL what these fucking mods do on Reddit.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; I do feel reddit was founded under ideals that run counter to the way it is currently being ran.

100% agree. they have sold out in order to feed their burgeoning server bills. honestly i'd feel easier criticising them for it if i could offer an alt that allowed them to keep their souls.

&gt; It is about the masses of people that are missing out because reddit is a huge magnet and also acts as a filter.

we have to be very careful to not see ourselves **above** humanity. it often takes an enormous amount of mental energy to understand how someone else arrives at their viewpoint, and sadly it is easier just to judge, shame and move on. but none of us are immune to propaganda. ultimately, this is a problem of education and reddit's only choice is to serve the (broken, naive) market in front of it - or go out of business. being 'honest' is not a viable business plan because too many people that are necessary to keep reddit afloat (the mods) are only interested in helping **ON CONDITION** that they promote propaganda.


&gt;I guess at the end of the day I just really don't like it

100% agree :-)


&gt;I bet there really are people that haven't considered how much manipulation goes on here. Although I'm sure they will come to realize eventually.

it is a full time job to get them to the point of cognizance. even then - people need to WANT to put the effort in. Personally, i don't believe most people will ever see how much propaganda they have inadvertently accepted as fact because most people are busy struggling to stay afloat.


&gt;I feel like talking about it shouldn't necessarily be avoided

you are free to do as pleases you within the law. personally, i only criticse when i can propose a better alternative. right now i can't. i tried voat for quite a while but FUCK ME those guys are toxic. they literally make redditors literally look insightful and kind. that should say it all.</div>

I'm fervently **pro**. I have no idea how you managed to relate reddit fascist mods to NN tho?

&gt;by secretly changing what it appears that others say

sure; sock puppetry is a huge problem. but not a reddit-specific problem. if you can offer an alt platform that resists all forms of shilling I would be most impressed and would definitely want to use it!

&gt;Say, by deleting all the arguments for something and leaving all the arguments against something.

Sure - it sucks when the mods of a neutral-sounding sub have a massive undeclared bias eg r/worldnews and their obscene pro-immigration / Left bias. It really sucks. Which is why I unsubbed! Hurrah! If I cared enough I would make effort to create and maintain a sub called eg r/unbiasednews but i don't care enough (I'm too busy). Therefore unsubbing from biased subs is good enough for me.

&gt;Don't like it? Just use another carrier. And also don't speak to anyone who use that carrier any more of course.

I don't know anyone IRL from Reddit. This is what fundamentally differentiates Reddit from an actual Carrier. Because everyone is anonymous here, I take *everything* said here with a pinch of salt. If I could **authenticate** users' identities - that'd be different.

&gt;They privately own the mechanisms of that manipulation so I, morally, have nothing to complain about.

You do know that there are other sites out there don't you? You do know that **every** major (popular) news outlet in the whole world has an often-undeclared bias, right? Like the Guardian and its ridiculously pro-feminist bias? I don't understand why you are singalling Reddit out. I don't pay for the Guardian or eg the BBC specifically because I can't stomach their bias. Same with many subs here.

&gt;Anything else is immoral. Right?

Not immoral, just worse. Imagine if everyone who disapproved of everything got their way. There would be nothing left! This is why I don't think we should ban offensive things. because if we did - there would be nothing left because someone somewhere is bound to sincerely be offended at something unique. 

&gt;My complaint is about the public at large being deliberately misled about what others are saying.

Again - this has been going on since people first began speaking. Propaganda began with humanity. you act like reddit invented it! i fail to see how reddit is any different to anywhere else.</div>

Why yes there is! Also: with the brains of anyone and everyone who has ever disagreed with you, ever. Including former versions of yourself who held even minutely different opinions to your own. 

All that being said, your comment to which I replied was this: "It's a matter of principle. [1984 quote.]"

To which I replied about your principles not being violated or relevant (in someone else's sub or house) as long as the law is adhered to, which those wannabe fascists at OotL ppear to be doing.

&gt;You've gotta be the most out of touch person I've ever had the misfortune to come into contact with. 

Well aren't you lucky?! Or just reclusive. Or both: I guess the two don't exclude.

Anyway have a great life. I probably won't reply to you again since you have expressed the maturity of a child and thus have now exceeded my conversational interest.</div>

It's all well and good quoting 1984 and talking of principle and such. The point is that going in to someone else's sub and saying stuff they disagree with is the same as going in to someone's house and doing the same. 

go start your own competing sub, and treat people differently, if you want. this conversation is the same as the one I've had with /u/BigSloppySunshine in this very thread. see my points to him, because they apply to you too.

the very fact that you can come in to another sub (like this one) and complain means that 1984-style fascism **does not operate here**</div>

your problem is your excessive perception of your **entitlement**. no-one - certainly not reddit inc - owes you the slightest fucking thing.</div>

no-one is forcing you to use this site. it isn't a **right** but rather a priviledge.

&gt;Reminds of GWB's free speech zones.

i don't kow what this is....

&gt; Certain types of people are against it. Certain types of people are for it.

Think of subs as people's houses. You can't go complaining about being kicked out of someone's house because people are legitimately king of their own castles.

the problem is when eg r/rworldnews has a massive undeclared left bias and bans any other viewpoint. people have a reasonable epxectation that a sub that has claimed a commonly-understood name will have an unbiased outlook. sadly, since mods are not accountable to anyone or any set of rules other than reddit's and the law, anyone can 'squat' as mod of any sub.

this is a failing of reddit. again - no-one is forcing you to use reddit.....

legally and ethically - you **don't** have any right to complain about behavour on reddit as long as it doesn't break the law - which these dumb mod fucks didn't do (correct me if I am wrong).

we are all accustomed to certain entitlements - but these don't all exist on reddit. i think that is the cause of this misunderstanding.</div>

Subs operate strictly under a system of **no voice / free exit**. 

Register your dislike by pressing the unsub button. Which, personally, after seeing this - I might do for r/OutOfTheLoop. They can go fuck themselves. </div>
