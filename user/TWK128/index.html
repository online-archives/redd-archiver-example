I swear, you sound like a wannabe-Chinese person with a high school education pretending to be a multiple Ph.D diplomat, journalist, and crusader for justice.

Instead of writing these powerful statements or calls for justice, everything you write ends up sounding fake, uninformed, ignorant, and excessively verbose, like a junior high kid thinking they can write beyond-college level stuff as long as they leave thesaurus.com open and overwhelm the reader with copious volumes of projectile word vomit.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That's a lot of word vomit to acknowledge you have zero credibility and freely lie to (badly) advance your objectives. The sad thing is that you end up acting against your objectives because you so badly lie and still think word count means anything in real world arguments.

Also, quoting this to preserve it. You'll inevitably realize what you've admitted to here (likely with assistance since your self-awareness is what the physicists call "non-zero") and attempt to scrub it. I'm not letting that happen.

> Let's induldge you and pretend for a moment that I'm lying. Well first of all there is nowhere in the TOS that states that it's actually against the rules to lie. In fact the real question is why you are so keen on uncovering or exposing people you don't like for lying. I think that shows that you are operating in bad faith. There are times when it is simply the right thing to do and better for all involved to suspend disbelief rather than to seek out facts which may ultimately be detrimental to the values of our modern secular, liberal, democratic society.

> So you want to know why it's supposedly immoral not to believe? We are living in a society and as with all societies, there are certain ground rules, things which must not be questioned. But other than that your query is actually quite amusing. Nevertheless, I'll play along and attempt to educate you.

> Lying isn't inherently immoral. In fact, it can be quite advantageous at times. Lies can be powerful tools in manipulating others, protecting one's self-interests, or achieving certain goals. Take a tense hostage situation for example, for instance lying could in fact save lives.

Let me reiterate what people have been trying to tell you over and over and over and over again: You're not as smart as you think you are, you know less than you think, your attempts at being clever are naked and laughable, and you are such a poor liar that calling your childish attempts at deceit "lies" is giving them credit they and you have not remotely earned. 

Please, for yourself and for the causes you allegedly seek to advance, stop. You hurt your own esteem and any cause you allegedly support to a far greater degree than you ever help. You damage whatever arguments you attempt to promote so much that even those who would be your allies or in agreement with you are embarrassed to be associated with you.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I'm absolutely sick of the spam I encounter in other subs so I'm actually kind of happy they're being as proactive as they have been. There's been a lot of shit-tier posts in that sub and it's a lot cleaner because of it.

Your appeals read more like an unrepentant, indignant spammer than they do a wronged party acting in good faith. Tone does matter, and, frankly, something about your rebuttals to their claims smacks of evasion and selective disclosure.

Maybe it's because English isn't your first language. Maybe it's the mood you were in. I don't know. But re-read what you wrote as if it was written by someone else, or have someone you know irl read it and see what they think about what you wrote.

In the end, yeah, I give the benefit of the doubt to the mods in that subreddit because I've been there since season 2 and I know how fucking shit it can get if the mods don't keep it clean. The ban may have been excessive, but if you *have* to post random links to enjoy the content of a subreddit, you might want to think about why you believe your screenrant link has a greater or equal right to populate that subreddit than the actual cosplayer's post of the same content.

It may well be that the screenrant article was linked multiple times by multiple individuals and you were the 79th reposter so they were at the end of their patience. And in that light, your inattention to the sub really does matter because you're both admitting you're not a regular visitor and that you don't actually care whether something is reposted 79 times so long as your one time is accepted. And if you were a mod with their power to decide who can and can't post, would *you* unban someone that clearly doesn't care about the overall quality of the subreddit, but only that they should be able to post what they want when they want, regardless of other factors?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Frankly, if they have a lot of screenrant post spammers/spambots that they've been instabanning, you may have just been inadvertently caught in the net, and given how prevalent a lot of the spambots are, I don't blame them for doing what they do.

Further, given the cosplayer apparently posts directly to the sub, it's hard to justify promoting a screenrant article about content that could well have originated on the sub (which was then used to create the article you posted).

A lot of the site spammers are insidious, and a lot of sites steal content they find on reddit. Combine the two and I think you can understand why they are triggerhappy with their banhammer.

They may have initially thought you were a screenrant spammer gloating and farming karma from images taken from the subreddit.

And I have to admit that that would not be something I'd be approve of if I had mod powers.

And if you really think your article link is still completely justified when the actual cosplayer already directly posted, I don't know what to say to that because, yeah, it really is low effort. 

You're expecting them to see your perspective but you seem to give zero fucks about theirs. Do you not think they have a point about you reposting something that isn't even from the original cosplayer? Do you not get that s6 has been releasing for months and actually just finished?

So you don't have to care about anything that's happened or been posted in the subreddit, but *they* need to let you post what you want because *they* doubt know what you've been doing the past few months?

They can't know what you have and haven't seen and it's not their fault you haven't been paying attention to the show or the subreddit. Maybe actually catch up on both before you start posting stuff you think no one else has seen.

Edit: Also, ffs, your fucking username is "karmagheden." Are they supposed to be think you're *not* a bad faith karma farmer with a name like that? FFS, think, dude.</div>

From roughly August on, no one's been citing that study because even *they* know it was bullshit. 

What kind of special do you have to be to put an old shit study about med students in a training/low intensity setting above the real world successes of efforts in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, an much more recent data from *this fucking year?*

If anyone's trying to pretend science only says what they want it to, it's probably the kook waving around an old, unrelated study that has even been called inapplicable by its authors.

Clearly *someone* has never done an actual fucking lit review.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well, that's the thing. You don't think having a genital preference is transphobic, and the subreddit didn't think it is, but there are people out there saying that if you come across a trans person and they're, say a trans man, if you  were to reject or not be interested in a relationship because you won't accept their "boi pussy," you're a transphobic bigot. This is the thinking that the subreddit was rejecting. 

There were trans people in the sub who also felt some TRA people were going too far in trying to make or force others to acknowledge their choices to the point of claiming that if you're gay and don't accept trans people as potential sexual partners, you're TERF scum. 

The worrying thing was seeing how often trans-women were having an influence on places that were ostensibly only for women like r/lesbians or r/actual lesbians. There were cases highlighted where it was becoming normal for posts to complain about people not accepting girl-dick or being insistent that only "true" lesbians weren't afraid of girl-dick. 

Honestly, wish you could have been there when it was up because I'm probably one of the last people who should be explaining this.</div>

It's pretty fucked that if you're gay or bi and right leaning, they're basically saying there is no place for you. 

In a saner time, that'd be seen for just how intolerant it is. But woke fascism can never be called what it is.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">No, it was about divesting the T from the LBG movement. 

They felt the "movement" had gone beyond what the original goals of the gay and bi community had sought, which was tacit acceptance. They were also tired of being called transphobic for actually having a genital preference. The consensus there was that the TRA community was making "gay" almost meaningless if you have "lesbians" who are trying to guilt lesbians to accept their "girl-penis," or vice versa with trans "men." 

If it really was a choice, then all the "born this way" thinking goes out the window. At that point, you're being asked to override what literally makes you gay so that a trans person won't call you a TERF or transphobic or a bigot. 

They also didn't care for the extremely violent rhetoric coming out of the TRA community. For example, the last post I saw today was a reference to a post in r/teenagers about wanting to punch a /r/LGBDropTheT person in the face. Or the other stuff about saying TERFs or non-accepting gay individuals (transphobic bigots, naturally) deserve to die or should be shot, etc.

They also didn't care for the co-opting of the Stonewall Riots by TRA. Notably specifying that the "trans" person of color was actually just a drag queen, not actually trans, and actually arrived after the riots had already begun. 

They also tended to not agree with gender-reassignment treatment or surgery below the age of majority. Given that such treatments are not easily reversible, it seemed irresponsible to put those kinds of decisions in the hands of people who can't always be trusted with smaller decisions, much less life-altering ones like this one.

It wasn't about denying Trans people rights, mind you. It was about not having trans activist dominate the movement at the expense of people that are merely gay or bisexual. The level of denial of both being gay and bisexual was regularly on display in posts that were from TRA or other "queer" folk who seemed to either despise or reject gay and bisexual individuals, especially if they were "cis-scum" or the like.

They were against the radicalization of the overall movement that had gone from letting people live their lives and on to forcing others to accept things that may not be for them.

If this feels incomplete, it would likely be better explained by someone who was active and more fitting the demographic of the subreddit. I was just a lurker/observer. It was a reassuring place that sanity hadn't fled all quarters on the social "left."</div>
