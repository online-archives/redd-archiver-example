    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">&gt; You are aware that NoNewNormal isn't an anti vaccination subreddit, but rather a COVID is a hoax and the vaccine that is being pushed is incredibly dangerous (so dangerous that the creators in the US are legally immune from any lawsuits against them from side-effects or other issues with the drugs), as well as talking about how useless the lockdowns and mask mandates were.

I blame the CDC and WHO for not explaining in more simple terms to the USA and the world the thread that COVID is.

COVID has about the same mortality rate as the common flu that kills approx 20K-30K  Americans annually.  

The regular annual flu kills approx 0.1%-0.2% of all those who are infected.
About the same as Covid.   Not so scary, right?  I agree.   

But...THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS:  Covid19 is 10Xs more contagious than the regular flu.  Because of the mitigation we had for Covid hardly anyone caught the regular flu virus!

Regular flu is contagious about 1 day before someone shows symptoms.

COVID is highly contagious for about 2 weeks and whoever has it will not know it unless tested and for 2 weeks may show no symptoms, mild symptoms, very serious to fatal symptoms after that 2 weeks.  All the while spreading it.

MILLIONS of people never catch the regular flu virus because it's not that contagious.  It's easy to avoid.

COVID is an insidious contagious virus that can infect millions before they know they have it.

That's why we had over 600K Covid deaths in 1 year instead of 20K like the regular flu.

If we had taken no mitigation efforts such as lock downs and masks we would have MILLIONS of Americans dead from this instead of 600K.

The vaccine for Covid is similar to vaccines offered for the regilar flu.  It's not a hoax.

I am very fucking angry that the CDC and WHO did not explain that the danger was the EXTREME CONTAGION abilities of this virus and instead they focused more on telling the public how dangerous it is if you catch it.  Because it's not that dangerous for a healthy person.  

If we had taken no extreme mitigation efforts we would have lost millions in 1 year instead of 600K.   A whole generation of seniors along with many younger people with existing conditions of all ages.

The other difference with Covid is, even if you are young and healthy and catch it, COVID-19 leaves many people who survive severe symptoms with permanent lung and/or brain injury.  Regular flu doesn't do that.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The problem with your statistic is COVID is much more contagious than the regular flu with also kills between 0.1% to 0.2% of people it infects.  Same mortality as COVID19.

To put it simply, the **regular annual flu kills 20K to 30K** people per year, most with preexisting conditions (but not all) and we never did lock downs and masks with regular flu.

COVID is much more contagious than regular flu.

Most people with regular flu are contagious for about 1 day before they show symptoms and it is contagious once symptom begin.

**With COVID-19, they could be contagious for up to 2 weeks without ever showing symptoms.  After 2 weeks being non-symptomatic they can get no symptoms, very mild or severe symptoms.  But they have been contagious and spreading the virus all that time.** That's the difference.

That's why the USA had approx **600,000 deaths** in 1 year from COVID.

 If we had no lock downs, no masks and no social distancing we would have had **MILLIONS of COVID deaths.**

Get it?</div>

My comment was a response to the headline and the article.  The gov of SD is excusing the fact that her state has the 2nd highest death rate in America because in her state you have more FREEDOM to go about your business with ZERO mitigation effort of this deadly pandemic.  

In fact, considering the geographical size of her state and the sparse population, South Dakota has one of the highest COVID mortality rates in the world.  In the name of FREEDOM!  That was the intent of my comment.</div>

They said I violated the rule about wishing death on anyone.

Does this comment look like I wished death on anyone?

Please give me your honest opinion.  I'm trying to figure out how to grovel and beg to get unbanned. 

Obviously I was not wishing death on anyone but of course my opinion on myself would be bias.</div>

Let's try to stick to facts and leave the politics out of it.  Maybe we can both learn something.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't think you should have been banned but it was a stupid fucking question that is based on bullshit that's trending on the most radical right-wing outlets right now.

Honestly, do you really think that because the guy took a few minutes on his off time to play a video game with his grandchild that he's just playing video games all day in the middle of a pandemic?  Do you really believe something that ridiculous?

If he spends 5 minutes taking a shit this morning do you also think he's just sitting on the toilet shitting all day in the middle of a pandemic?

Your question was moronic.    But no, they should not have banned you.   Not for that.  You should have been given the opportunity to have some people describe to you what an idiotic question that was.

But if they looked at your karma score they probably thought they were just dealing with an asshole troll looking for trouble.</div>
