    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>If you look at the actual study it's even worse.</p>
<p>Only 36% could write code any code that would compile at all, not taking into account whether it would run without crashing, was correct, or solved the problem.</p>
<p>This was of two simple toy problems given to them. 36% were able to write code that compiled for one or both. However only 14% were able to write compilable code for both toy problems.</p>
<p>But it's worse than that. Less than 5% could write <strong>correct</strong> code that <em>actually solved the problem</em> and didn't crash.</p>
<p>And most of those guys wrote code that, although correct, had terrible performance. Only 2% could write correct code that was reasonably efficient.</p>
<p>This wasn't some small study either. They tested 36,800 graduates of over 500 different colleges.</p></div>

<p>i'm still scratching my head over what this could possibly be about and I'm too afraid to even look into it because I may pull out my hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I looked into it and you're right. One one of these a big contributor, in his own private life elsewhere and outside of the context of any software project, said he did not agree that small children should be allowed to undergo gender reassignment surgery. These people then said he was transphobic and descended on his projects to get him removed, blacklisted, and this CoC assigned.</p>
<p>I agree with the guy. Extreme genital mutilation of children, which is what these SJWs are actually advocating, is not OK. If an adult wants to do it it is their business. The people advocating this are very bad people.</p>
<p>Beyond that though even if the contributor was wrong, or was advocating for a return to segregated buses, or donating to conservative or communist or whatever political campaigns, it is their own business and has nothing to do with their development work. Their doing development work does not oppress anyone or provide a hostile environment. However, these troublemakers with their CoCs and their witch hunts, their cyber-stalking, and their harassment and bullying of people with opinions they disagree with are definitely and clearly creating a hostile and unwelcoming environment for people. As soon as they start with this they should be given a warning and if they persist, should be removed from access to the communities they are disrupting.</p></div>

Much of their code seems to be trivial wrappers for other libraries, plus scores of text documents about feminism and such, which have no business belonging on github as it is a code repository. Is anyone aware of anything significant this person has contributed to the technology field? Many of the people being harassed are significant and notable contributors who have done real work.</p></div>
