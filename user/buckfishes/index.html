So you’d think libs would care about going after the criminals who use illegal guns, but they don’t, if anything I’ve seen more of them outright defend gang members from being called “thugs” like we just saw in KC than they’ve shown any concern with ridding society of them.

Ignoring rampant theft because they’ve made stealing easier to get away with, punishing vigilantes and criminalizing self defense is something exclusive to the most progressive parts of America. 

You’ve got libs who’d never bail out a political enemy, out of their principles but would bail out violent offenders, yeah that really shows you how much someone cares about DV that they’ll bail out a man who beat his wife and let him finish the job. 

Their right to bail doesn’t mean you must help them get bail, if you actually cared about the victim you wouldn’t do this. And liberals certainly do not put victims first. 

Ive come away from this convo learning that I didn’t generalize liberals enough.</div>

Women saying they’ve been harassed by the same man because of relaxed laws against keeping them safe from their victims is something Democrats did. 

The other day a congresswoman shared that black women are most often victims of DV, but didn’t go into details on who the most common perpetrators are, this is what I mean. They use certain crimes to benefit their narrative but actually do not care to do anything that would target the perpetrators.</div>

When you get that small number, show me all the Democrats concerned about the larger number of the shootings, then ask yourself why you can’t find many if any. 

Is it because they only care about the “gun restrictions” part and gang shootings don’t fit that part of their agenda so……they don’t care?</div>

You especially don’t become someone who’s dismissive when it comes to all those other crimes that you dont see a way you can benefit from. 

Liberals do seem to be more sympathetic to criminals than their victims, that’s why it’s not unbelievable they have and continue to be soft on if not bail out criminals who rape, attack and kill people.</div>

It doesn’t help that a lot of them have made caring about crime a “right wing talking point” so if I watch them act accordingly what else am I suppose to presume about the left wing? 

I was actually hoping they’d show me a place where liberals take crime seriously but instead he just reaffirmed they only care about certain crimes that they can “campaign on,” as I already knew.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Did you read my post? You don’t care actually about crime if you only care about specific crimes that benefit your political campaigns.

The same liberal that supposedly cares about rape and DV will support bail funds that free rapists and abusers, I don’t think Kamala endorsing a Nazi freedom fund would go over well but a fund that’s releasing rapists wasn’t a problem for many libs.

The same liberal that cares about gun violence only the 1% of the time it’s a random mass shooting will then vote and support soft on crime DAs who’ll let gang members off easy and continue the more common occurrence of gun violence that liberals completely ignore. 

Wage theft isn’t the only form of theft, it’s just the only form the left cares about.

So my generalizing was fair since you made an example of yourself to prove my point.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I know there are exceptions but it’s a fair generalization, like saying conservatives want Trump isn’t always true but it’s true for enough to make the generalization. 

I’ve seen nothing from liberals to show they’re bothered by crime unless they’re the victim, most of the time they’re very dismissive of it AT BEST. Especially since the riots of 2020 where not only did they not care, they told you that caring would make you a right winger. 

You can’t have a problem with crime and vote for people who endorse bail funds and support soft on crime policies that clearly don’t benefit anyone but the criminals.

If you can point me to where I can find an abundant source of liberals who ever talk about violent crime that a) doesn’t directly affect them and b) isn’t just the type of crime that they can use for political propaganda I’ll gladly check it out. 

Till then I’ll just keep seeing the ones giving pushback to anyone who isn’t going full on crime denial.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">This is why every generic sub that doesn’t bend liberal needs to be careful of these gross power hungry freaks invading and corrupting the sub into another r/politics spin off. 

Justice Served used to be about criminals getting their comeuppance, but libs hate that so now it’s just another “Republicans bad” clone, they did the same thing to Publicfreakout and even BlackPeopleTwitter used to be funny memes before it became a place for blue racists.

I see them trying to do it to r/lookatmyhalo and r/AmericaBad in real time, they can’t stand to know a popular sub exists out of their control.</div>
