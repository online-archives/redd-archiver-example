    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I’ve said this many times before. Just because you find a racist comment buried at the bottom of the comment section, having gained no traction whatsoever, it does not mean the entire subreddit is built on racism. If you can find a legitimately racist comment, like the one above, that gained any traction or didn’t get buried, then you are correct. But until then, your argument is just dense with no real proof.

And about the automod thing: It’s supposed to just be a joke. With every other subreddit telling jokes about white people, I think it’s fair for a couple of subreddits to have jokes about black people. </div>

Ah, the old “no, you’re wrong because you’re wrong.” You guys really are godawful at arguing your point.  

And the extreme censoring of one of the few political subreddits that wasn’t left leaning is pretty upsetting, banned or not.</div>

I could ask you the same thing. Were there legitimately racist comments on r/cringeanarchy? Yes. Without a doubt. Would these comments ever reach the front page or gain any traction whatsoever? No. They wouldn’t. So where the hell does your argument come from? Every subreddit has an ugly bunch, but they can’t control that, it just happens sometimes. If I went over to      r/oddlysatisfying and started spitting racial slurs everywhere, then according to your logic, r/oddlysatisfying is now a hate subreddit that promotes racism. Don’t let a small group of people define an entire community, it’s ignorant and idiotic to do so.  And if you want to argue that posts that reached the front page were racist, then that would just reinforce that you really have no idea what you’re talking about, and that your only real evidence is your feelings.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">R/politicalhumor is constantly offending conservatives. Does that mean the subreddit should be banned? Because it hurt a group of grown-ass people’s feelings? No, it shouldnt be like that, because we should act like grown-ass people and not adult-babies who can’t stand another opinion. And as biased and brain dead reddit is right now, nothing else comes close in scale and popularity. Nowhere else can you find so many communities for so many topics all in one place. If there was something better, I would’ve jumped ship a very long time ago.</div>
