You can say you respectfully disagree with someone, and get permabanned for "incivility" by a mod team with the communication skills of a toddler, while a dozen people respond to you in a cursing/raging conniption fit, and that crap stays up. 

Other generic default piss-bucket "I'm neutral" subs off the top of my head include news, todayilearned, teachers, justiceserved, instantkarma, politics, entertainment, music, greenandpleasant, happy(lol irony, some of the most bitter mods, ever), antiwork, explainlikeimfive, askreddit, whitepeopletwitter/blackpeopletwitter... There's several more, I'm s ure.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Oddly enough, digg pulled this type of thing about a decade ago, and to much lesser of a degree than reddit is doing now.

Most people abandoned digg, and went to reddit.  I don't know where people from reddit can flee to, now. I originally liked it for the text-based no-nonsense sort of newsgroups layout, but it's turned into a total nightmare.  I don't know what has become of "left wing" politics on this site, but it doesn't match anything I see with anybody I know in person.  It's like a very small group of people are controlling the narrative of what they want people to think, and believe.</div>

Difference is, that's 99.9% of people, and there isn't a team of SJWs ready to berate me, or crusade online forums when I say ew/nasty, and "change the channel".

I don't demand the world to learn, or even care about any abnormal hobbies or activity I do, and neither should anyone else. Everyone needs to mind their own business. Even the religious nuts don't go that far, as the most they usually do is silently judge you for not believing in their sky fairy. When people don't mind their own business, they shouldn't be surprised when they get an even bigger boot out the door.

Lastly, "grow up" isn't an argument to civilized discussion, it only shows that you are incapable of articulating your thoughts, so insulting others is all you have left.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">The only difference to contrast is who they have sex with (anything but M/F...?), so you shouldn't be surprised when that's the focus when people talk about it.

"Grooming" seems like a strong word, and implies stuff like preparing someone to be sexually assaulted.. no idea why people are referring to it as that.  Still, pushing such material on children is inappropriate.  If they really want to know, they can search themselves, but keep it out of the curriculum.  Math, science, history, but not politically motivated sex ideologies... facts about the bird and the bees should be as far as it goes, as at the very least, prevent unplanned pregnancies.  If they decide they want to irreversibly mutilate their body, they should be at least 18 and not expect taxpayers to assist.

As for stuff like TV and movies, things should flow naturally.   I noticed more frequently they will force a minority (sex, skin color, etc.) into the plot that clashes as an afterthought, as if to only get people to bicker about how bad the show was, and how bad of a person someone is for not liking it (making it about how a norwegian character was black or bi or something).  

TBF, I don't care for seeing hetro people snogging in every single movie either, and it rarely adds anything significant to the plot, but hey, if someone can see 2 seconds of scarlett johansson's titty, it will boost ratings for an otherwise boring show... but I'm free to turn that off without a small hostile group calling me a xxxx-phobia/phobic bigot for giving it the stink-eye.  I know it's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting that people with different interests existing doesn't mean you have to like them, or give them anything.  You don't see golfers calling basketball fans PGAtour-phobic bigots, do you?</div>

They want to proselytize to them (with borderline non-age-appropriate sexual material in schools) like many religions do, and cue the namecalling, and censorship if you insist on sensible discretion.  It's such a dissonant stance, as the left tends to be the sympathetic one to bettering our educational system.

Every person I know, democrat, or republican voter outside of these online forums agree that discretion is necessary.  This site is definitely getting to some communist China levels of silencing people.</div>
