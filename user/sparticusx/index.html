    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Community is the biggest thing I feel atheist in general lose out on. I attend a UU church for that reason. The online atheist forum's I have found myself in consistently attack religion on all sorts of illogical points and look down on someone as stupid or ignorant if they do beleive. They cannot see any good done by religion. They are actually the ones blinded by there own ignorance. I also see quite a few newer atheist using atheism as almost a form of religion, instead of coming to that decision through reasoned thought and a ton of studying and learning. They seem to just reject things they have no real understanding of or the consequences of that rejection if they are wrong. Few leave open the possibility they are wrong which is a similar view most religious folk I meet have. I find my self attacked regularly in the atheist forum here on reddit for defending the Pope mostly. I think he is a pretty great guy and a true man of God that is also a man of the people. Though I guess that could be because of my upbringing too that I feel sentimental in some way toward the Church. I was raised traditional Roman Latin Catholic. I like to think my self open minded and willing to change my point of view and admit when I'm wrong...which is often. I spent years trying to find a religious path to follow and the more I pursued them the more disillusioned I became. In the end I realized it took too much rationalizing to believe in a sky king so I begrudgingly became a atheist by definition. That word held a very negative connotation because of my upbringing. I just have no way to prove that he could exist so I have no choice but to accepted he does not. I was not able to defend faith in the end. I do not know how to have faith in something I cannot come to understand in a factual way. I did however recently discover the idea of a universal cosmic consciousness. I don't have faith in this but it's a interesting thought. Its the idea that existence is the product of consciousness. We think therefore we exist. Thought is the only way to create some thing out of nothing. You can look it up if your interested other people write about the idea better then I can. This could also potentially be testable using quantum computing and the advent of mass data collecting. I would think you would be able to show a interconnectivity of all things on earth and possibly beyond using algorithms and computers if it is there to find. We shall see I think it's a cool idea either way.

Anyways it has been nice talking with you today. Hope you have a great day keep thinking.

Peace.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I really wish now I had not attacked you :(   You seem like a really chill dude that has actually thought this through. I can respect that.

I can tell you are a progressive Christian and I support and encourage that movement. I do actually agree that someone in the middle of the spectrum can be influenced good or bad by religion, philosophy etc.... So I would like to see them gravitate towards a more progressive church and not be sucked in by some cult or fundamentalist organization when they are at lowest point. 

I have, in my early days of being a atheist, helped someone lose their life. I convinced, using some rather aggressive techniques, a newish Christian that God was a fantasy. I knew this person joined the church and had found hope and a reason to live after spending 10+ years as a junkie on the streets. I took that hope from him and I did nothing to attempt and replace it. I felt at the time like I had succeeded in helping someone see the "truth".

He died of a over dose two weeks later behind a dumpster in a alley. I feel guilt to this day for that. As I have overcome drug addiction myself, I know first-hand it is not easy. I used the rooms of AA which I would consider having a progressive view of God. A power greater than yourself. I used that view for hope at the time. After the fog of addiction had cleared I could no longer maintain that view of God, but non the less I needed that hope at that time. ( I think I just made some arguments that support your view that it is sometimes better to just say Trust God and it will be okay. Then to try and teach someone philosophies or theological arguments.... These do not give the person immediate hope. I and many addicts I know, need that immediate hope when we first walk into a AA room) 

I no longer try to convince anyone to change their beliefs. I mostly now just preach back at people preaching to me that I'm going to hell or if someone try to say Islam is a religion of peace(lol). Or I have discussions about theological ideas with open minded people at the Unitarian Church I sometimes attend or here on the internet since it should be pretty hard to convince someone to leave their belief system in a anonymous forum. 

Thanks for not judging me as I judged you. I think you helped me grow as a person today. I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me and not just attack, even though I did not give you the same respect initially. 

I also think I misunderstood what you were trying to say in your very first post about Christianity being  mostly good thing for most people. That is what you meant I beleive.  But what I read it as, was that Christianity did the most good for the most amount people for the longest period of time. Which I don't think now think you were actually claiming. Nor do I believe you think brainwashing people is a good thing, just that telling them to trust and believe in God can be the best way to quickly stop a lot of people from going down a very bad path. 

Once again thanks for actually being Christ like, and I'm sorry again for my earlier tone and attacks.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I have no idea how anyone can attack any religion if they are part of a religion. The people that do really need to see if those same criticisms can be applied to their own belief system.

At least Christians have admitted, for the most part, that their is some fucked up shit in their bible and terrible violent acts perpetrated in the name of Christianity in the PAST before the reformation. All Christians ,that I know for example, think bombing abortion clinics and protesting funerals with hateful signs is appalling and they speak against it. 

If Christians want to speak out against violence in another religion that is perfectly fine because they speak out against violence in their own religion. I oppose, the my religion is right yours is wrong because...blah arguments. Those kinds of arguments can usually be used by any religion claiming superiority over another.

Islam has not gone through a reformation to bring that system of religion up to par with the expectations of the modern, equitable, progressive, global society we all live in. They are still trying to force a ancient rule of law written by a wise man trying to help the people of his time be better.

 I don't believe Mohammed ever intended his writings to be a form of oppressive government 1000s of years later without any changes to it. Though I could be wrong he might have actually intended that and he might have actually believed he was talking with God's angels...maybe he was tripping balls on some psychedelic plant....or maybe he, and most writers of ancient prophetic text, used the God said it path since it's easier to convince people to follow God then to follow man. 

In both the Bible and Quaran some very practical advice is given such as not eating pork. When cooked incorrectly pork can be deadly. After you see this happen a few times as the leader of these people, you figure the best way to keep them from dieing eating bad pork is to say God says no pork.

At the time the Quaran was written it helped a lot in creating a very liberal progressive society......at that time in history. Today it is just backwards, racist, misogynist, violent nonsense that should not be considered at all when creating a modern system of government for modern people.

I do sometimes attack Christian beliefs I find outrageous, but I do not equate the Christian religion to Islam. They are not equally bad. 

I will argue both the Bible and Quaran, taken literally, are both equally horrible. What Christians today get right is that they look at the Bible through a filter of love. This allows you to disregard the awful parts and focus on the liberal message of Christ. This does not happen nearly often enough in Islam. They often view it literally or through a lens of having outside oppressors or a need for jihad.  

I more often criticize Islam then Christianity because of this. 

Hell the new Pope even said " who am I to judge who gets into God's heaven. I don't presume to know the mind of God". No high ranking members of Islam are pushing a message of acceptance and peace like that. 

TLDR : Evangelicals can be criticized for quite a few things but overall the Christian religion is trending in a modern, progressive way and has been since the reformation. They also, for the most part, do not want biblical law to be the law of the land. 

Islam is stagnant. It is used as a guide for a authoritarian government that controls a large amount of the worlds population. Jihad and martyrdom, child marriage, female circumcision, stoning people, male superiority, to name a few, are still prevalent ideas in Islam that need to be criticized.

How anyone can be against Christianity and for Islam is baffling to me. 

Peace.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You didn't say x is good. You said most people for the majority of existence have benefited from Christianity. I pointed out many examples of why that is just not true.

I don't beleive good decent people would be anything but good decent people regardless of their religious affiliation. Also I beleive having a religious affiliation as a shitty , terrible person will not make you not a shitty terrible person, I know you know some really shitty people who claim your religion.

I was claiming in my last couple statements of that post that being of any religion is not going to make you better or worse, it's your actions and what you do in the world that make you decent or terrible, not a religion. I should have used less extreme examples. Obviously, Hunan behavior is in a spectrum, my point was that they are a child molesters or a saint or any thing in between regardless of religious affiliation.

You seemed to be advocating for brainwashing children that God is the ultimate Santa Claus, is the best way to stop them from being bad. I think teaching them, reason, logic, science, and free thinking would be much better ways to do the same. Is that harder then manipulating them...yea...but that which is easy is not always the best.

Edit: you didn't say best way it was just the easiest way my bad.

Edit 2: I also apologize for being so condescending in those last few statements and for implying you might be a child molesting, 
Serial killing rapist. That was wrong I take things to far sometimes. Sorry. Also, you have not expressed the belief that Christianity is the only way to salvation and I kinda attacked you like you had. My bad again.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Most of humanity for most of its existence has not had Christianity. Lieing to people about God to scare them like you do with little children with Santa Claus cannot be the best way to help people. I guess you believe the end justifies the means? That a very slippery slope to be on.

 Getting some one to beleive and have faith in something they do not understand, just because they are young ,malleable and easily manipulated is wrong. They are the same techniques used by the leaders of child armies and terrorist groups. 

Also in what specific ways do you beleive society is better off because of Christianity that would not have happened without Christianity?

During the Islamic golden age great works of art and literature were created. New maths were created and others were more fully explained. They were one of the, if not the most, liberal society at the time. 

During the periods of the inquisition and the early dark ages eastern civilization was thriving without any Christianity. Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, and Russian societies all had civilized, progressive societies that contributed huge amounts of knowledge to humanity in the form's of math, science, art, engineering and literature before Christianity even existed. 

Do you really think your God wants people to just believe in him even if they have no true understanding of Him, just what was fed to them when they were too uninformed and ignorant to question what they were being told was fact? 

If in fact the people in Christianity would more than likely be terrible humans, serial killers, or rapist, or child molesters. And fear of God's wrath is ALL that is stopping them, then yes please keep those church doors open and keep brainwashing them when they are young. 

If you don't beleive the majority of Christians would be inherently awful people if they had been born Muslim in Saudi Arabia or atheist in China and could not come to accept Jesus as their Lord and saviour because of their family, culture, or location. Then I don't understand your arguments. If you do believe this, well fuck,I guess please please continue being a good Christian and I'm sorry if I might have offended you, in case you ever lose faith and start whacking people.

Peace.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">So do any Christian sects not believe the Bible is the final word of God? Serious , I don't know of any. It just comes down to what lens you view the text from. Also I was only arguing that the books are equally disturbing not the religions. Most Christians today do not follow the Bible literally and look for its meaning instead. There are some sects of Islam that also look for the meaning instead of the purely a literal translation. They are in no way the majority unfortunately. Mainstream Islam is much more a threat to the civilized world today than Christianity, mostly because Christianity has been reformed, Islam has not.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It really is just about the interpretation. Both books taken literally are truly awful. Both books more progressively interpreted are not so bad. Problem is both books can and have been used for justifying an amazing amount of violence. 

Do you believe that during the inquisition that Christians did not beleive their holy text was in agreement with them? 

Do you think the West Borough Baptist Church believes they are doing God's work based on their interpretation of the Bible? 

Christians had the reformation.....It reformed their beliefs to be closer to what you  describe as modern Christian beliefs. Fundamentalist Christians and Atheist usually see the Bible literally. In this sense it would be as bad as the Quaran. 

Here are just a few examples of red letter new Testament Jesus referencing, teaching from, and protecting the old Testament.

The Scripture cannot be broken’ (John 10:35). 

He referred to Scripture as ‘the commandment of God’ (Matthew 15:3) 

and as the ‘Word of God’ (Mark 7:13). 
He also indicated that it was indestructible: ‘Until Heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law, until all is accomplished’ (Matthew 5:18).

When dealing with the people of his day, whether it was with the disciples or religious rulers, Jesus constantly referred to the Old Testament: 

‘Have you not read that which was spoken to you by God?’ (Matthew 22:31);

 ‘Yea; and have you never read, “Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babes thou has prepared praise for thyself”?’ (Matthew 21:16, citing Psalm 8:2)

and ‘Have you not read what David did?’ (Matthew 12:3). 

The bible, if taken literally, seems to imply rather strongly that the old Testament is indeed valid.

Here is a link written by a pastor about different modern ways Christians interprete the Bible. 

http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogerwolsey/2014/01/16-ways-progressive-christians-interpret-the-bible/

Also it seems you think Islam is a single entity. There are various schools of thought and interpretations of the Quaran. There are various different sects and groups of Islam. Hopefully a progressive movement inside Islam happens and they can have there reformation as well.

Peace.
