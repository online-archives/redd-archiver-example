    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Haha, yeah. I can agree. Also, what's happening in Canada, courtesy of Justin Trudeau to fund propaganda media lying, and not fund Rebel News unless it is willing to lie, to qualify for government funding

these strategies/techniques are useful to recognize predatoriness that is able to occur in any country, including in United States, and in a naturally profit manufacturing fashion, given opportunity to legitimize these things as being legal, and by means of exploiting the sources of authorities that dictate what is and what is not legal, which in the case of the 100+ United States governments, all of which are separate and kind of isolated, the attack vector for exploiting United States inevitably requires collusion, undocumented, or otherwise evidence shredding, which in the case of these things happening, it seems somewhat sufficient of a kind of protection to the point that at least there's enough string left to pull to uncover the exploit vulnerability, and to call out all the involved humans who have been facilitating for these things to happen, and hopefully to use these exploits as reference to further improve the infrastructure of United States such that:

free market businesses seem to be a better implementation of security than any government institution that is able to exist, such that the people can represent themselves by using business framework to operate as a legal business that is not engaging in illegal scamming.

otherwise scam government establishments are incredibly difficult to go bankrupt and fail or be held accountable or charged with crimes for engaging in illegality, especially in extremely large colluding fashion 

also, any scam businesses that are incentivized by revolving doors lobbying to governments, where past/present staff are switching between working in governments or companies at different points in time in their career, are inevitably attempting to manufacture their own scammy business strategy to be treated as legally legitimized.

These types of companies set up by predatory personalities are inevitably unsustainable

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">Well, technically, even though YouTube is a "company" and not a "government" and even though YouTube is acting like a "government" framework that is above and beyond survivable representation of the people, as if to disassosicate itself into deity-like territority for delusionality/derangement manufacturing to the point that persons like @TrumpVoter1 (who may or may not be a citizen of United States, the country where Google is headquartered, or otherwise they may also be an employee, staff, or insider for Google/Reddit too, and speaking on behalf of enabling and protecting the company), if the people speak up loud and clear enough to dictate what they want out of Google/YouTube/Reddit, rather than for Google/YouTube/Reddit to dictate what the fuck they want from the people to be pressured, forced, coerced, intimiated, submissived, bullied to do, then.... for sure, maybe not what I suggested above, but something.... will eventually happen, if the people realize how to stand up and express their voices and choose what they do and do not want.

Besides, kidnapping, holding hostage, stealing, extorting, blackmailing, and other manipulative predatory phenomena is not psychologically healthy, and just because Google is engaging in predatory exploits doesn't mean it will always preserve those exploits to operate unchecked and unbalanced as if it is too big to fail like what may happen in other countries with poor sustainability frameworks for everyone.

I wouldn't be surprised if once Google/YouTube starts to see big dips in their profits, that they will freak the fuck out, and the "not going to happen" statements will become inaccurate, incorrect, mistaken.

Also I think the platlisher (platform/publisher) strategy that Google tried and continues trying will likely be documented throughout history as being one of the most pervasively segregatory/divisive civil war-inducing type of divide and conquering effort that is borderline psychological warfare</div>

I agree. It seems Amazon integrate bait-and-switch price models into its business practices.

Not only would this result in invasive scans that risk violating all users’ privacy and security, companies would arguably become government agents subject to the Fourth Amendment."

Generally, I do not think that Ruqqus is coerced by more than zero coercers into things like https://www.ruqqus.com/post/4xh where Ruqqus is refraining from deploying something related to images for fear of getting dehosted, referencing claims that MAGAImg was dehosted by users posting CSAM for sole purpose of framing MAGAImg as a CSAM content distributor, however, given that, for example, Imgur remains hosted, and not nonfunctional like MAGAImg.net, I am curious how the EARN IT act, or related concerns, are related to Ruqqus to be legally immune from being liable for violations, especially as it relates to privacy.

For example, I do not consider that anyone has much of any privacy whatsoever for using Ruqqus, such as by facilitating for distributing CSAM and then claiming that more than zero information at all that exists on Ruqqus platform is in any way able to be claimed as private, and that both Ruqqus and any and all users should respect their right to privacy, including that which may account for any hiding or concealing of traffic, such as using Zombie Network hacked/compromised PCs to relay traffic through, VPNs, Proxies, etc.

I am curious though, from perspective of implementing anti-CSAM, why it seems so difficult or time consuming or expensive. I kind of expected that it wouldn't be a difficult process to set up.</div>

How the fuck are you able to deprive every single of your employees from representing joking on April Fools, and why the fuck would you do this? How the fuck do you expect anyone to ever joke for any day whatsofuckingever if you can't even handle joking on a day that is most traditional for the celebration of jokes?

It's not like China is facilitating for an Adolf Hitler style Holocaust extermination of humanity, or even if they and others are colluding to manufacture such a theatrical performance, why should anyone be afraid to joke?

Besides, laughter is probably some of the best medicine. How the fuck are you going to be intentionally depriving so many persons from additional sources of such natural medicines and why the fuck would you be so evil to indulge in such deprivation phenomena?</div>

Maybe I might need to offer myself with a subscription price model.</div>
