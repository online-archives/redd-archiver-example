    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I appreciate your replies too, and while English might not be your 1st language, your English is better than any of the non-English languages I use.

The point that I am really trying to drill down to is that the vast majority of religion-fueled violent incidents in the west are carried out in the name of Allah/Islam. Because of this fact (the data is plentiful and available) I consider Islam to be a bad thing when implemented in the west.

Again I will readily point out that all of the Muslims I know personally (which is 5, plus their families) are super nice people. A year ago there was a terrible natural disaster where I live. It destroyed the homes and lives of dozens of families. The only people, who I personally knew, that got off their asses and went to the site of the destruction were a couple of my Muslim friends. A group of people from their Mosque took 2 days off work to help the affected people of whom, I'd guess, 95% were Christian.

That said, the actions of, and polls from, the Muslims who are currently being imported into the west by the hundreds of thousands indicate a strong incompatibility between western culture and fundamental Islamic beliefs/values. Places in Europe that previously had negligible violent incidents are now experiencing a tremendous rise in such, and it is all perpetrated by, and directly correlates with, the recent influx of Islamic people and culture.

It is sad that when I look into the effects of the influx of Islamic values in the west I only find violence and despair - I have yet to see any positive effects of the integration of foreign Islamic culture. I want everybody to just get along. I might have negative opinions concerning Islam, but I don't want Muslims to suffer at all. I just want the conflicting culture of Islam, and the violence that the Quran dictates, to be localized to Islamic countries.

In short, people of western culture are being viciously assaulted by people who adhere to the words and culture of Islam. The victims wouldn't be such if not for the influence of Islam. I don't see any positive effects coming from integrating the "real" Muslims into western culture - I only see suffering. Suffering that is encouraged by the definitive holy teachings of Islam.

You made a point in one of your comments previous about "real" Muslims/Christians/etc. versus those who don't follow the exact word of their holy, foundational scriptures. In my opinion, people who don't adhere to the exact words of their fundamental religious texts aren't truly Muslim/Christian/Jewish (to include all the Abrahamic religions). To cherry pick the convenient/agreeable parts of religious text that fundamentally defines the religion is, in my opinion, questioning the authenticity of the God/Allah/Yahweh, which unravels the entire purpose of worshiping an almighty deity in the first place.

As for you personally, your beliefs aside, I hope you have a great weekend.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">It was written very clearly. You're going to wear your fingers to the bone if you try to justify every instance of the Quran inciting violence. I'm sure that there is always a context, or excuse, to justify murdering non believers.

Any written word is open to interpretation, sure. One religion is responsible for the staggeringly vast majority of religious attacks. That religion is dictated by the Quran. How can this be interpreted such that the religion is not the cause of so much violence?</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You are correct that I am partially judging the religion by what some of its people are doing. I am also judging based on the fact that the Quran very clearly commands Muslims to kill non-Muslims. This is why Islam causes such a huge amount of violence and death to innocent civilians - orders of magnitude more than any other religion yields today.

Quran 8:12: "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"

Who are "those who disbelieve"?

Quran 8:13: Those who "defy and disobey Allah."

That's one of dozens and dozens of examples in the Quran that call for maiming, raping, and murder of non-Muslims. Now why should I care? Well, my country is accepting hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees. Some of these refugees assault and kill in the name of Allah, as the Quran tells them to. The refugees' actions have increased the rate of violent attacks in many destinations by many orders of magnitude.

Take a look at the map below. The locations of terrorist attacks directly correlate with Muslim refugee population.
