    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">That is extremely rich coming from you. You purposely posted about a ban from almost 5 months ago so that it is a lot harder to find your actual comment that you made. You think a ambiguous "joke" can be taken as just that without any clear context that it was in fact a joke. You obviously, and this is quite obvious, tried to create a narrative in YOUR favor but when you immediately get called out on it, you result to insulting and belittling the person who did so.

I do not personally know who you are. I cannot take your comments and joke and mere face value. The fact that you thought that nobody would use common sense and see through your extremely veiled attempt is sad.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">One can be taken as threatening bodily harm, the other is obviously a joke. Did you lose your common sense? These are words on a freaking screen. And your title obviously doesn't match what actually happened. You are clearly trying to cause conflict and stir the pot. This is further shown by how long ago this ban happened. You did this so that it would make tracking down the actual comment very hard to do so you can create a narrative to fit your story.</div>

And it's not sexist to say it's probably a woman until you implied it was biased and you also connected it to your "joke".

As it is quite clear that you did not indicate that it was a joke, the banned was deserved.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">I don't know why this is a hill you are choosing to die on. I have made it abundantly clear in what I meant. You, at this point, know what I meant. So let me dumb it down for you. I had asked you on what you had said exactly in the comment that got you banned. You have never answered it. You instead, insulted me, twice over at this point. 

I wasn't asking you to explain your "joke". I even advised you what to do in the future to reduce the chances of you getting banned on other subreddits. Your thinking that you don't have to make a "joke" in text abundantly clear that it was a joke is stupid, naive, and ignorant thinking. We cannot hear the infliction of the rather small voice in your head through text. The fact that you seem to not get this brings about the question of whether or not you have brain cell to use.

Due to your extremely childish non-joke and outlook, the one who has to grow up is you. I have tried to be civil in this discussion. I will not be engaging with you again. I hope you can actually learn something from this and better yourself for the future.</div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">You just told me to "Grow the fuck up". That is attacking me. And you still have not clarified my question. It is quite obvious that you are not a victim in this and that you did not make the "joke" clear that it was a joke. As such it was taken for what it should have been taken. Next time make it clear if a joke is a joke. I personally do not find "The children should be beaten" as a joke. I could have probably taken that you were joking if you had clearly stated as such.

For example. "The children should be beaten /s" or "The children should be beaten. (this is a joke)".</div>
