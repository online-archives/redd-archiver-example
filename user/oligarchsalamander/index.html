        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>The reason why flat ui is popular and why all studies point to it being better is a combination of things. I'm not an expert on the topic, but essentially your ui is supposed to be simple enough that anyone can mash it and it does the thing it's there for. Ideally your webpage has one button on it and nothing else essentially.</p>
<p>Flat ui forces designers to be more careful about the amount of crap they smear across your screen. You are meant to be drawn to key areas, with actionable buttons being usually of a certain colour. If you have something wildly complex you're probably doing something wrong in the design. If you have something wildly complex and you aren't doing something wrong with your design then lay it out so that actionable stuff is all inside of areas where everything in it looks the same and is all actionable.</p>
<p>Text works well for this everyone is familiar with links.</p>
<p>Flat ui is also popular because it doesn't look like retarded shit from before people knew what a computer screen was. The screen is not 3 dimensional, adding bevels and drop shadows does not make the screen 3 dimensional. I don't need software to insult my intelligence by pretending it's a control panel in space either.</p>
<p>Put some buttons on the screen, keep the UI tidy.</p></div>

    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>Unless your phone is loaded with bloatware, no, and if it is then just root your phone with vanilla android. If you're trying to get away from Google, LineageOS won't take you there. They're completely cucked for Google.</p>
<p>LineageOS fully expects you to install Google Play Services. The alternative is microG, something that LineageOS doesn't even support. So if you expect you phone to be able to do basic shit you need Google play services. Don't believe me? Spend a day trying to root LineageOS on the thing, don't install Google play services, and see if you make it a week before thinking &quot;holy fuck a lot of Android isn't open source anymore it's all in Google play services.&quot;</p></div>

        </small>
    </h6>
    <div class="comment-body mb-2 p-2 bg-light rounded"><p>I adjust the structure continuously throughout development. I keep it as simple as possible and extract functionality out as it gets large enough, or becomes clear enough that it's a separate piece of functionality. Or a piece of functionality that could become more detailed and specific if it were moved to its own area.</p>
<p>I try not to over plan the structure at the start because it's always wrong. You need an src directory, some primary files go there, generally that's all I have with a util directory inside the src directory maybe. As I end up with too many files there I reorganise it into more directories within the src directory, each one of them perhaps having their own util directories.</p>
<p>Or maybe I don't use util directories, I dunno. I find structure to be nearly as enjoyable as solving problems.</p></div>

<p>If you can stand it to stare at a computer screen 6 hours a day 5 days a week, you're on par with half the developers that get hired. And of the ones who don't get hired but interview? Holy shit seriously so much money is wasted interviewing people who don't even know what a loop is. Worse than that once in a while one of them actually gets hired.</p>
<p>Scrum, which is this stupid methodology where basically you're only as good as your worst developer, just exacerbates the problem. Managers think it means they can hire lots of shit developers and it forces them to put their heads together. The software industry is seriously a disaster, it has been for decades.</p></div>

<p>This and the push to hire female developers, why! They didn't go to school! There was never a female in a single programming class I've ever attended in my entire life. Am I expected to therefore see any female developers? Not the number there are that's for sure. Am I expected to believe that they couldn't take whatever course they wanted in school?</p>
<p>It's the same shit here. For some reason merit stopped mattering and that's why everything is bad.</p></div>

This is really dumb too, but holy hell Apple you bunch of losers. I remember having to build some kind of audio processing in swift try searching for anything relating to &quot;Swift audio&quot; and gaze in amazement at the thousands of blogs talking about Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>I swear to god Apple you have a special place in hell waiting for you.</p></div>
