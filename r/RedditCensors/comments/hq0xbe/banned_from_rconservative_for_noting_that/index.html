It sucks you can't point out the truth, but like Israel, conservative subs on reddit are surrounded by hostiles trying to destroy them.</div>

    <div class="md">Funny you mention this, I called out a user on another random sub for claiming that r/conservative are all racists.

I've never seen anything remotely racist on there and nor would they ever be able to provide any proof.

What these idiots don't realise is that the more you push the pendulum to the left, the harder right it will swing. They will be the cause of any hard right wing action.</div>

The admins will still ban the sub sooner or later. You can have the best moderation in the site and you will still be banned if you contradict the narrative.</div>

    <div class="md">That is the reddit admins though.  They and their darling, rabid leftist subs (hi /AHS) constantly harass /conservative and such subs.

Blatant political censorship is very obvious and just keeps getting worse.

That's why /conservative, and other such subs, that are under constant attack, are forced to be so, so careful about such things.</div>
