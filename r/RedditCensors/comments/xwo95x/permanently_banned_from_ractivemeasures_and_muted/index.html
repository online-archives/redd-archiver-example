I replied with "I'm not a Russian troll and I dispute it. See https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8" my reply was downvoted and after I logged out I noticed my comment was not showing up, I assumed (wrongly) it was the link, so I went to make another reply minus the link and I was unable to post. I checked my inbox and:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/ActiveMeasures. You can still view and subscribe to r/ActiveMeasures, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;Russian troll

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/ActiveMeasures by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

and:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/ActiveMeasures. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/ActiveMeasures for 3 days.

So I can't even dispute the ban/post removal or accusation of being a Russian troll.

How does this not violate Reddit's moddiquette? 

Just a reminder that the NP means no participation, so please do not vote or participate in this thread. This is just to document the censorship and mod abuse.

I'm really not a Russian or troll. I am not even a right-winger. I'm also not pro-Putin and I don't agree with his invasion of Ukraine, as I have stated numerous times.

I also had another comment removed in a different thread in that sub where someone said to me "lmao, nice try ruski Edit: lol, you even post on WotB, a known Russian psyop sub" and I replied with:

&gt;I'm an American and a leftist and you sound like a lunatic calling people 'ruskies' when they challenge the official narrative over Russia-Ukraine.

&gt;And this sub looks far more like a psyop than wotb.

Wondering if mods removed any of my other recent posts. 

And it seems the user I initially replied to has an thing for calling people Russian trolls and censoring them/no doubt reporting them to get them censored and or banned. I guess I will just message the mods there in 3 days and appeal this ban. Hopefully I can speak with a different mod than the one who just banned me and sort this out. If these other mods refuse my appeal over say, civility, I will question why these other users are free to call people ivan, ruskies, Russian trolls and Kremlin propagandists without any consequences. Is that rule not enforced equally because a mod is engaging in this behavior themselves on top of abusing their power with censorship and bans?

**Update:**

I wrote to mods there earlier to appeal my ban and sorry if it is a bit redundant but I basically repeated what I said here and defended myself against this ridiculous troll accusation:

&gt;I'll like to appeal the recent ban against me. I am not a Russian troll. I disputed another users assertion, noticed my comment had been removed and saw that I had been banned with reason given: Russian troll. I am now wondering if I replied to a mod and they were the ones who did not like anyone challenging their assertion and did the banning.

&gt;I'm not a troll or a fan of Trump or Putin, I am an anti-war leftist who has denounced Putin's invasion of Ukraine, who has promoted diplomacy and called out hypocrisy where it exists and I don't see why I deserved to have my comment removed let alone be banned and perma banned at that. What I experienced comes off as mod abuse and if it is a civility issue, well, I see the same user calling people Russian trolls in this very sub, just as I see others here calling users 'ivan' 'vlad' 'ruskie' or 'Kremlin propagandist' if they ever deviate from the official narrative, offer alternative views and evidence challenging that narrative. Not exactly fostering a place for healthy debate.

Yes and I felt the need to mention my political stance and know I shouldn't need to, but that is the state of things today. I spoke the truth there and they still will not even give me the time of day. See below.

And hour later I received a reply:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/ActiveMeasures. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/ActiveMeasures for 3 days. 

I suppose I'll try again in 3 days and ask why they are muting me rather than taking the appeal seriously, which is something mods are supposed to do. I believe it violates moddiquette to not take appeals seriously. It seems these mods do not care. Do admins? 

I don't know how to contact admins to report mod behavior like this or I would have done so ages ago, but if these mods *do* somehow contact them over me messaging them to appeal this ban, I hope admins look into the mod/s here who label  anyone they don't agree with as a 'Russian troll,' censor and ban them and immediately mute them so they can't defend themselves and question the ban, only to mute them *again* when the user messages them days later for an appeal to this false accusation behind the ban.

I said that because whichever mod is doing the ban/muting, strikes me as the type who may consider my appeal as a sort of harassment, if not also me documenting their censorship and mod abuse here. And as another user here brought to my attention, it says in their own sidebar "The goal is to create and maintain a space where anyone can share their point of view on this topic, even if the moderators disagree with you." The mods behavior and actions do not reflect that at all and it actually violates their own civility rule - I touch on that in my appeal message to them.

This type of modding/modsmanship w/e is not helping the Reddit community or the brand, but harming it. Admins may not step in until it's a potential financial threat to the company (prove me wrong) or they may never step in, but this type of moderation will 100% contribute to this sites downfall, not to mention the blatant astroturf/paid for posts, votes and reports. We all know it's happening. We knew it was happening back in 2016 (I provide evidence to support that in the very comment that was censored) and it has only gotten worse ever since.

**Update 2:**

4 days later, I replied to the original ban message with:

&gt;Could I please appeal my ban from your sub? I am not a Russian troll (or any type of troll) and I don't appreciate the censorship and ban based on this absurd accusation and being muted directly and then again when I first tried to appeal this ban. Please take my appeal seriously, as per reddit's moddiquette. By the words in your own subs sidebar, I should have been free to dispute this other users assertion without fear of being censored, labeled a Russian troll and banned, but was punished anyways, running contrary to your own mission statement. And a mod calling users 'Russian trolls' within threads, violates your own civility rule, does it not? Maybe this mod is okay with the hypocrisy, but is the headmod okay with it? What would admins think about this?

10 minutes later I was muted again and received this following reply:

&gt;Russian troll. Muted.

I received another reply a half hour later, assumingly from another mod, which read:

&gt;u/karmagheden,

&gt;This is a follow up to let you know that we've reviewed your ban on r/ActiveMeasures.

&gt;First off, an apology is in order. We have recently added mods at AM due to the growth of reports and our ability to keep up with them. Unfortunately, one of our new mods was not on the same page with our moderation policies when they called you a Russian troll. That shouldn't have happen and we apologize. 

&gt;However, after reviewing your recent activity, your permaban will stand. You have submitted numerous rule-breaking comments, particularly rule 1 and rule 3, and have previously been banned for breaking the subs rules. Furthermore you have brigaded the subreddit. The mod team, including the top mod discussed a permaban for you weeks ago, and we agreed that one was warranted if you continued to post rule breaking content and to brigade the subreddit.

&gt;If you would like to dispute your permaban you can appeal to the admins.

I replied and hit send but of course, I had been muted so I could not reply and contest this other mods points but my reply is below.

&gt;I put NP in the title so it was not a brigade. I have seen this mod call folks Russian trolls within threads on the sub and have seen other users call people ruskies etc, and directed at me yet they did not have their comment removed and I doubt they were banned. So you have evidence of other users and the mod in question violating the civility rules, but they get a free pass and somehow my incivility is worthy of a permanent ban???

I did not promote a brigade against their sub, I documented and linked evidence of folks on their sub smearing wotb https://np.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/w8raxk/tulsi_gabbard_rand_paul_placed_on_list_of_russian/illxrnx/ and by this mod's own definition, evidence of activemeasures users brigading wotb or promoting/instigating a brigade against wotb and even individual users of wotb, notice their users never put NP in their links? Notice the comment chain for full extent of the 'brigading.'

Secondly, the two comments of mine that this mod linked (and I think it was the two times I believe I have ever been uncivil there), one where I said folks sounded deranged and the other where I was debating with a user and said sarcastically that it's folks like Chomsky, Mearsheimer, Bernie and Kissenger who fell for Russian propaganda and not this other user who fell for NATO/US military industrial complex propaganda, and while I admit these were not exactly civil, I have received multiple replies by folks there (probably dozens since I first posted there) including by this other mod that were easily equal if not worse, with name calling e.g. ruski/ivan, troll accusations, comments claiming I have fallen for and or was spreading right wing and Russian propaganda and yet their comments were not removed and they were seemingly not banned. 

I was previously banned as documented here https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/mgs52m/permabanned_from_activemeasures_with_reason_given but it was unwarranted and a mod there admitted this when they lifted the ban, so I don't know why this mod would try to use this as reasoning to uphold my current ban. They said they discussed banning me over the brigade thing despite it actually being me documenting their users doing this to wotb, and that if I continued to post rule breaking content and brigade activemeasures, I would be banned. Posting to activemeasures is not brigading (plus I get downvoted at each turn ffs, where is the brigade again?) and I posted no rule breaking content until those two recent comments, so the 'numerous rule breaking comments' point is also inaccurate. I am very curious what I posted there before those two comments that this mod considers rule breaking because I have bent over backwards to be civil in a sub where people are constantly name calling me ruski or Russian troll when I attempt to actual debate people on topics and I am not the only one to get this treatment. Anyone that disputes the official narrative there is treated like this and mods do nothing or they join in, as I pointed out.


Lastly, apart from that inconsistency in rule enforcement, how do those two comments of mine alone warrant a perma ban? Even that is extreme and I would appeal but I am muted and anyways was told to speak to an admin if I disagree with this mods decision to uphold the perma ban.

Nearly a half hour after that mod's reply to me, I received a message increasing my mute time from 3 days to 28 days, so now even if I wanted to say to that mod what I just said here, now I would have to wait a month to do so. Shameful mod behavior, even from the seemingly more professional mod.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Opposing or even moderate political views are quickly censored by mods so that the conversation inevitably takes a tone that reinforces their often **radical left viewpoints.**

I don't think these folks are left wing, but even if some are dupes on the left, I don't see how liberal and neolib talking points are considered radical left viewpoints. Liberals are at best center left, not your average leftist and neolibs are often just center right democrats and even neocons. Reddit is basically a liberal establishment/US govt/NATO propaganda board brainwashing leftists who probably make up the majority of Reddit users.

What is radical left about being pro police and security state, pro surveillance state, pro censorship, pro war/imperialism regime change/proxy war, anti-Snowden and Assange, anti-independent media? You know, 'fascism' when someone they don't like does it. I admit these viewpoints are authoritarian and thus radical (as is the redbaiting mccarthyite paranoia) but *leftist* viewpoints?

Not to mention the same people push propaganda/misinformation/disinformation (some behaving and posting like trolls), just as they accuse others of doing on the daily when anyone deviates from the official govt/MSM/NATO/neolib narrative. But I am curious what you mean by radical left viewpoints because I have seen Bernie's policy (which is popular apparently even among republican voters) called radical left. Maybe putting idpol over class issues could be considered radical? Maybe claiming to be leftist but ignoring class issues and or being opposed to class solidarity, is radical?</div>

They muted me, too. Didn't tell me why. I'm guessing because I am a "Russian troll", aka anyone who disagrees with or questions the government and media.

Eventually these folks will realize what is going on and they will feel really silly. I suspect they're about to that point right now, which is why they are on a banning and muting spree, to protect their echo chamber and keep the charade going just a little bit longer.</div>

    <div class="md">Spider, I've removed your ban at r/ActiveMeasures.  If anyone else wants me to take a look at their ban, please reply here or DM me.

We had a mod (who has since been suspended from reddit) add another mod (without first consulting the existing mod team).  The new mod had some core philosophical disagreements with our existing rules.  That mod went through our history of reported comments and banned anyone they suspected of being a "Russian troll", which is counter to the founder's (and my) vision for /r/ActiveMeasures. As /u/DreadnoughtOverdrive points out, our goal is "to create and maintain a space where anyone can share their point of view".  

To be fair to the mod in question, Russian influence on the platform is rampant, and we do get frequently brigaded at r/ActiveMeasures. Additionally, reddit's neofeudalist moderation system didn't do us any favors in this situation.  With that said, we've rectified the situation by removing the mod in question, and I am trying to reach out now to anyone who feels they have been banned unjustly.</div>

    <div class="md">Much respect Mr. Gonzo.

Wish you well with the totally lopsided reddit admin crap.  Notorious for secrecy and abuse, as even the mods of the most rabid leftist shithole subs, given *enormous* privilege, complain of constantly. 

BTW, FAR more Shareblue shills around, from right here at home (media matters = anti-American propaganda). than any "Ze Russians!" nonsense. 

Not ALL mods that are on horrible subreddits are totally evil. We've seen undeniable evidence of this today. 

Respect, for your personal integrity, and upholding the stated rules of the sub in question here. Bravo.</div>

    <div class="md">Please see my reply to their comment here before you praise them too much. They did not lift my ban despite them allowing others who do worse, from personal attacks to inciting brigade, to continue posting there, as their posting aligns with the narratives that are pushed and embraced there (you can take a guess which) and gives the sub it's purpose/reason to continue. 

The Russians aren't the only ones engaging in "active measures" and I notice some narratives or assertions there are not just propaganda but actual lies/disinformation and if I were to provide countervailing evidence to debunk a talking point as such, I would be called directly or indirectly a Russian troll or Kremlin propagandist, be downvoted and liable to have my comment removed. That is accepted there and I took it for a long while, but when I finally bite back in the slightest way, that is enough reason to uphold a ban after this mod admitted yet again I was wrongly banned with the false accusation of being a 'Russian troll.' 

So a mod (who violated the subs own mission statement and rules) was removed as mod but was allowed to continue posting there, and this other mod is now unbanning this user above in this thread to save face, just as with removing that other mod, but I think the latter is more of a move to avoid conflict of interest and culpability and for plausible deniability. If they were genuine about being fair and rectifying the issue, they would be consistent and lift my ban or ban all these other users as well and I would ask why they hadn't already been doing that all along if they even stick to their rules rather than just enforcing them selectively and arbitrarily with bias.

You're absolutely right about Shareblue not to mention MM4A, CAP and other like-minded neolib/neocon pro war, imperialism, military industrial complex, security state apparatus, MSM, big pharma groups/think tanks having a bigger troll/astroturf presence and influence on Reddit (and other social media platforms - to manipulate perception, control the narrative and discourse) then anything the Russians are doing. But users here will have you believe Russian trolls are everywhere and all powerful to sway elections in the U.S. and in the minds of every individual who would dare criticize the dem party, their elected official or push for third parties, while simultaneously pretending there is never any propaganda or disinformation coming out authoritative MSM and denying the existence of liberal establishment/US or US backed trolls/astroturf on Reddit and other social media. Sorry, there is no way Russia can compete on the information warfare front. We are seeing this now in real with with Russia-Ukraine war/conflict.</div>

    <div class="md">Fully agree that the /ActiveMeasures sub is total Shareblue level propaganda. Constantly spewing total bullshit that is either already debunked, or is soon after. 

Defo one of the more toxic, rabid-leftist shitholes on this site. 

Your ban wasn't lifted after all?  Hmmm well then, just proves your very good points even further.  :-(  Keep spreading  the truth dude.</div>

    <div class="md">I updated my post here after I last spoke to an activemeasures mod, when I was not able to dispute the justification for upholding the permanent ban, because the mod did not unmute me so I could reply but instead extended my mute from 3 days to 28 days. Please read my response here and explain given the circumstances how those two comments of mine warrant a permanent ban. 

I saw regular users say worse to me than what I said in those 2 comments and without any consequence, as they continued to post and this was my experience each time I have posted there over the last year or so. That including uncivil comments made by that mod (who is no longer mod as you say) but is seemingly still allowed to post there. Both comments you use as justification to uphold the ban, had not been removed previously but what *was* removed were civil comments where I politely defended myself against troll accusations and provide evidence to back up my claims. How many posts and civil comments of mine were removed since I first posted there, I wonder. Did these other users who treated anyone with an alternate take as a Russian troll, get the same treatment, even when they made uncivil comments? Sure never seemed like it. Does that sound remotely balanced to you?

If you disregard my previously ban, as you should since it was unwarranted / based on false accusation (that was confirmed in the message I got like a year ago when it was lifted), I have not violated any rules since then that I recall, until these 2 recent comments you can point to and say are slightly uncivil. Would that not warrant a warning or temporary ban at most? I also never brigaded your sub, I merely documented folks from your sub smearing wotb and by your own definition, inciting a brigade upon wotb and or even individual wotb users. 

Furthermore, on top of being called names and being on the receiving end of innuendo to discredit me / attack my character, I was almost always downvoted despite taking the time on numerous occasions to debate in good faith. I am glad you uplifted this other person's ban, but think given the treatment I have received by this other mod and by users there, and given the inconsistency in rule enforcement, it is kinda unfair to uphold a perma ban against me.</div>

    <div class="md">You wont beat the corrupt circle jerk that is in place at the moment.

Social media has indeed become the the heavy handed guide to what all should think and feel.

Alot of us know what is really going on and know that there is no point arguing a point against a bot or bio-bot (human moderator in place to progress the narrative) on any of the main effected platforms.

Don't waste your time. Feels a bit 1984? ..I'm afraid we passed that point a long time ago and most never felt the pinch or realised the jackboot was the community you were so desperate to please.

Who knew the downvote would become a guiding beacon to the truth.</div>

    <div class="md">I was also banned/muted from /r/activemeasures for questioning the narrative. The irony of their sub is they are an echo chamber of US propaganda, attacking anyone who questions it, calling everyone a traitor, which is exactly what the point of Russia's active measures campaign was, to get Americans to turn against each other. If the Internet had been what it is today back when Bush invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, these people would have been online saying the same shit they're saying now. "Don't you care about 9/11?! Saddam is an evil doer! Look at all the terrible things he has done to his own people! He obviously planned the whole thing! If we don't invade Iraq and stop him he's going to use chemical weapons on innocent people! What, are you some kind of Saddam sympathizer or apologist?"

Really it was easy to get people to this state. It all comes down to Donald Trump. They managed to convince millions of Americans if people say X, Y, Z, they are Trump supporters. Literally that's all it takes. If they want people to accept or oppose a policy, they just tell them Donald Trump is for or against. It's actually a pretty handy tool to manipulate people. Almost like that's the whole point of Donald Trump.</div>
