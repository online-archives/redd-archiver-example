    <div class="md">- Made a post about 'unsubbing from feministtears' over being pre emptive banned based on posting in other subs.

- Multiple other users in that thread stalked my post history and started attacking me for posting in Braincels and The_Donald as is the normal course of action from people stalking my post history.

- I report this as brigading and I get banned instead without a reason why:

I have little clue why constant 'OMG U POST IN TEH DUNELD AND BWEINCELS' whingefests are even tolerated on reddit, and I made a thread in asktheadmins or somewhere such a while ago suggesting that stalkling other user's post history should be against the rediquette ... and surprise surprise, everyone posting in that thread also did exactly the same thing.

Edit, found that glorious thread here, from r/ideasfortheadmins:
