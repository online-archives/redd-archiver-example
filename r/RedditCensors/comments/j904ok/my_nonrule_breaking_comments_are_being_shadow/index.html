__________________________________________

&gt; DiMezzo said, as law enforcement, any of her own of her deputies “would be fired on the spot, and perhaps charged with crimes, for any brutality or misconduct.”

&gt; If her deputies don’t want to police the police, she said they can either quit or sit in the office and play video games.

&gt; support gun rights and limited government and combat police wrongdoing. Among her proposals is to have sheriff's deputies “pull over police for harassing peaceful citizens.”


Look how leftists ITT are still trying to shit on her, purely out of partisan politics, despite the issue of police brutality plaguing the USA currently. The hypocrisy is unreal.

She's also incurred transphobic hate, had her property vandalised, etc. I see no outrage from the SJWs of Reddit. What happened?

__________________________________________

I post this comment, it is appearing on my end but actually censored when viewing the threat through private browsing / VPN. I post a superficial, off topic comment, ant it appeared. I then edited that superficial comment to the above censored comment, and it disappeared again. 

The thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/j8w8ta/antipolice_satanist_runs_for_sheriff_as/?sort=new

Extreme leftist bias, blatant censoring despite no rule violation. Pathetic. This site is fucked. I'm done with it. Bye, Reddit!</div>
