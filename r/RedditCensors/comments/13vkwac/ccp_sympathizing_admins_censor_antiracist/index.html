Yet they are being shut down within seconds of being created and being labeled as spam subreddits DESPITE the fact that they don't have any spam whatsoever in them. Another time all 5 mods were banned or hacked within 1 hour and then the admins of reddit are then banning it for being unmoderated despite the fact that it was an obvious hack.

If you didn't think that the CCP is fully in control of reddit then this is PROOF POSITIVE.  They cannot counter my argument's - as I am a multi-PhD holder - so they must censor me.

This is what the CCP is doing, and it is a crime. Take a look at but sometimes you doubt, maybe you have a different opinion, but the CCP will not allowing for it yet won't admit it's wrong. If we don't know what to do, we won't do it.   There have been a lot of hearings and stuff that show when you make a mistake, you should admit it. But the evil CCP never admits it's wrong. It's gonna take away our right to speak up if we don't do something. We need to turn the evil CCP's supporters into good people. We should defend freedom of thought and speech. It would be bad for the evil CCP to create a mean and intolerant culture. The evil CCP is not keeping its promises. It's all lies. It wants to control everything and make us suffer.</div>

hate to break it to you.. this doesnt mean you are wrong.  I agree about the censorship of reddit, and the mods, etc.  Just because you hold a PhD does not mean you are correct about everything.</div>

But trolls will troll with their tiny troll brains. If op thinks that applies to them, that's their read. I'm just saying that as a general, non-targeted statement.</div>
