    <div class="md">They censored this comment. Seriously:

I'd like to piggyback by saying something. This only gets worse after the teen years.
Source: https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020

We analyzed data on young US adults aged 18 to 28 years from the 2001 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which contained information about partner violence and injury reported by 11 370 respondents on 18761 heterosexual relationships.

Almost 24% of all relationships had some violence, and half (49.7%) of those were reciprocally violent. In nonreciprocally violent relationships, women were the perpetrators in more than 70% of the cases.

The rough percentages:

12% of heterosexual relationships involving persons between the age of 18-28 have violence from bother partners.

12% of them have violence from only one partner.

8.4% of them are violent relationships with a female as the only abuser.

3.6% of them are violent relationships with a male as the only abuser.

I don't like calling anything a "gendered issue", I feel like it's an insult to the 30% of women in one-way abuse situations, but it actually is a huge issue for men especially due to men's inability to reach out and get help. Men's shelters literally don't exist in the US, no funding has been granted, barely any charities exist, and men can't even call the police without fear of being arrested instead of helped.

    <div class="md">of an 2 hour documentary? oh boi 

tl;dr : the documentary is about issues facing men, that have been neglected by society. Most people will stop at the first sentence because they will think? Huh men facing issues? how so? Men have no problems. It's that attitude that makes people gloss over issues that are stated above. 
In some countries the suicide statistics rise is 4 times higher for men (in relation 2 women). Suicide is the biggest driver in male death, yet no support groups, no question and no clue as to why. These problems extend from early on childhood (sons without fathers) too elderly homeless men. 
This documentary has been made by a lady that considered herself a feminist, but could not after this journey (you'll see how much troubles she has to actually have some empathy with the people she interviews).
The rest of the documentary I suggest you should see for yourself if you are interested in it.</div>
