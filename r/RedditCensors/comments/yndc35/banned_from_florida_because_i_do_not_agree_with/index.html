    <div class="md">I’m a progressive in favor of trans rights, and I’m not here to debate that but rather the permanent ban. It’s ridiculous. I’m constantly irritated by mods and other progressives who would rather wall off anyone that disagrees with them. Even basic representation of people who are not similar to the majority of the people in a subreddit get their comments removed, like when I post content that goes against male hetero stereotypes. The mods bring to their censorship their biases and do not have an appreciation for a difference of opinion or lifestyle. Reddit execs are in favor of this I’m sure, because advertisers would prefer it that way. Also the other person who responded is simply talking past you and not discussing the ban. Also they’re preemptively rude to you because of your opinion and didn’t even explain what they’re trying to say about the medical risks. Meanwhile you’re the one who is simply stating your opinion in a respect tone. God forbid they try to act friendly and try to understand why you feel the way you do and try to change your opinion.</div>

If discussion and information were allowed to be exchanged it'd be a near total collapse of today's democrat party.

    <div class="md">I don’t think that’s true at all. The RICH and corporations can only sustain itself on lies and censorship, rich democrats included. As for conservatives viewpoints, they don’t stand up to science, reason, pretty much the only truth contained in them is their feelings. The left could censor conservatives and be just fine, and that’s precisely the problem. The conservative poor is getting completely left behind culturally, socially and economically.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;  they don’t stand up to science, reason, pretty much the only truth contained in them is their feelings.

Funny, because that's exactly what republicans have been saying about democrats for at least a decade now. Guess the left has decided to steal that as well. Ben Shapiro made it famous and the left held massive protests a lot of the times he spoke at college campuses.

I can guess your stance on the covid shot, you probably call it a vaccine even now? That 'science' only held up under extreme censorship. A lot of us knew the truth and were banned for talking about it.

Studies have shown democrats have more mental illness than republicans. Democrats have an extreme hypersensitivity and react based heavily on emotions over thought or consequences. During the 2016 election a democrat was 10 times more likely to defriend someone over politics than a republican.

I can't speak for all republicans, but all the ones i know and the circles i travel respond heavily to science and the scientific process and reasoning. Consensus is not a factor in science, and is nearly impossible to get, nor is censorship. Statistics in particular appear to be out of favor with democrats, how scientific.

Headlines aimed at democrats tell them how and what to think before any information is provided. They've been trained to react instinctively to certain stimuli to override any thought that may occur or any drive to look into the data. The information is there and what the left is say is so easily debunked, but the harder someone tries to convince a leftist of something the more emotional and dug-in they become. There's no educating the brainwashed.

The instant a law becomes popular among democrat circles is when i know they're lying heavily, usually trying to sneak some bullshit into a bill and need public favor to cram it through.

Have you ever actually looked into any of the things you were told are true by the democrats? Do you honestly believe when Biden says gas was over $5 per gallon when he took office and he inherited that? Or that Putin is responsible? Or literally anything he's ever said in his life?

Next time you read a headline look into it, even the implications they're trying to present and the assumptions you're making.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh yeah, I’ve looked into headlines on Reddit, left leaning mainstream media. And you’re right! They do it too but conservative media is out there trying to make us wage slaves and don’t even care if they kill us and democracy in the process. I mean why even bring up gas anyway? The president doesn’t have any control over that, including when trump was in office. That’s a distraction for the much bigger fire. What do you care about more, the price of gas or possibly losing democracy in the US?</div>

    <div class="md">Clearly so. if someone 30 years old wants to live life as the other gender, then that is fine I wish them luck, but a 12-year-old is not of the age that they can really make that choice with anything along the lines of full informed consent. Adults should be the ones protecting children and seeing to their best intentions. Let them be of sound mind as an adult before they go through with those procedures.</div>

    <div class="md">Actually your right. Its strange that the dictionary reference of the word invokes 'right wing' so much when it 'was' a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control often seen in not allowing the opposition to have an opinion or exist.

So I wonder what the word for it is when a left wing organisation promotes these practices? In fact are we as fellow human beings actually allowed to have a word for 'walling off' opposing opinions of the left?

Can we master? can we have a word?</div>

    <div class="md">Puberty blockers are worthless if you want to wait after puberty. 

While probably not without any risks, you can use puberty blockers, and then give regular hormones if the kid changes their mind. It’s a way to give them more time to think, with (almost?) no long term consequences. 

If a qualified doctor and parent believe this to be the best course of action for the child, who am I or you to get in between them?</div>

and cross—sex hormones to children. **These treatments can have permanent physical

That is one part of it. Although children are not old enough and mature enough to make such irreversible changes to their bodies and life. It is the reason why children are not legally allowed to drive a car, vote, drink, legally have sex, and other things.

    <div class="md">Not dying of cancer is completely different. You are making some serious strawman fallacies and clearly not arguing in good faith. 

A more accurate comparison would be for a 14 year old having sex with a 30+ year old person. You have yet to explain why you think it is ok for a child to consent to drugs and surgery to change their gender, but not able to consent to have sex with a person.

What makes transitioning so time sensitive that they can't get consoling till they turn of age and grow into a person able to understand the consequences of their actions and are able to make the call? I am no bigot, if an adult wants to do it, then that is up to them. They are at an age they can make the call both mentally and legally. Children are not able to do either. It is a sad time when protecting children is frowned upon.</div>

Your “question” isn’t framed as a way to find out what’s true, it’s framed to try and manipulate people into thinking trans people getting medical care is wrong. Again, perfectly aligned with bigots and hate groups. 

I suspect if you weren’t a bigot you would have taken greater issue with that comparison by now. But I do wonder if you realise you’re championing their cause so much.</div>

    <div class="md">Answer my question or go away. What is the difference between CHILDREN wanting to get a sex change and wanting to have sex with an adult? Why is one ok, but not the other?

Adults can make whatever choice they want regarding their bodies. Children are not mature enough to make an informed choice.</div>

    <div class="md">To begin using pubertal blockers, a child must:

- Show a long-lasting and intense pattern of gender nonconformity or gender dysphoria

- Have gender dysphoria that began or worsened at the start of puberty

- Address any psychological, medical or social problems that could interfere with treatment

- Have entered the early stage of puberty

- Provide informed consent

*Particularly when a child hasn't reached the age of medical consent, parents or other caretakers or guardians must consent to the treatment and support the adolescent through the treatment process.*

This is the basic medical procedure developed by professionals in the field. It addresses your ‘concern’ over a child’s ability to consent to such treatments. Comparing medical care for trans people to pedophilia is pretty awful, something only a bigot or an incredibly ignorant person would do. 

Which one are you?</div>

One is life saving, the other is a cosmetic life-altering choice from an easily influenced and manipulated mind. You probably need to be told which is which since the sheer tonnage ignorance on display would stop a herd of stampeding rhinos.</div>

    <div class="md">Influenced and manipulated by who? Are you of the opinion there are people out in the world trying to give kids ‘the trans’? If you do believe it then you should probably also know that is literally homophobia repurposed to  attack trans people. 

Medical procedures are developed by medical professionals. Whether it’s brain surgery or trans care there are procedures and protocols in place to ensure things are done with the patients best interests in mind.</div>

    <div class="md">Medical professionals also developed lobotomies and electroshock therapy.  Can’t always just rely on the appeal to authority fallacy.  

Exercising caution is not anti-trans.  Making life altering decisions with a rapidly growing and changing brain is not something that should be taken lightly.</div>
