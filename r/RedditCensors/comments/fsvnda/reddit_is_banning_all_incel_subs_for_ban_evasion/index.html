      <div class="md">ever since shortcels was banned, they have taken down almost 10 subreddits, less than 50 people in some of them, private and public under the grounds of "ban evasion." why even ban a private sub?? how does that break rules if this non existence "violent content" isnt even seen by most users?

this means that they can ban one sub and subsequently erase any sub they please for their bs vague reasonings.

the fact that so many incel subs are being banned also means they are probably employing some auto banning, based off of usernames from banned subs.

they're one step closer to just blocking the word "incel" from their server, i'll move on when they finally do that</div>

    <div class="md">I have the feeling you didn't understand my comment. I described the activity *against* incels, and more generally men and ethnic Europeans. The reason for that is that there's no way in hell communists will get a revolution out of the working class anywhere in the western civilization. That realization brought the strategy of what's commonly known as Cultural Marxism. Political Correctness was the first phase of it, which literally means something isn't factually correct, but is politically correct; in other words, false but pleasing the political propaganda agenda.</div>
