    <div class="md">"somewhat" rudely is a bit of an understatement. Sure, you were right, but from the moderaters point of view, you really werent contributing to the dicussion in a constructive way. 

As someone with experience in forum moderation, when people post non constructive comments like that, you tend to think that person wont be a good contributor to discussion within your community. 

I dont think it was fair for them to outright ban you if this was your first response like that (i dont know if it was). But if you look at this from their perspective, you have someone who replied to a post by being snarky to the OP, and then calling both sides idiots. Would you let that person just keep going about your subreddit, and just hope it was a one time thing, even though more often than not, people who respond that way do it to many posts in the same subreddit?

I'm not saying you were going around replying to people like this, but from a moderators point of view, they dont know if you would or wouldnt keep acting like that, so they chose to not take a risk, and just go on with a ban. 

Also, one last thing, im almost certain that you wouldnt be banned if you had just said "Well, its not a terror tactic just because it was German and used by Nazi's, its just a war strategy" or something like that.</div>

    <div class="md">I understand your argument and I agree with it even though it does put me in a bad spotlight (not saying that's a bad thing its necessary for the discussion) and believe you are completely right when it comes to any normal sub, but considering the sub I think I would've at least been downvote bombed for just leaving it at the sentence you quoted, because the mods on that sub gave me a very hostile response for my ban. Its nice for certain to get insight from someone with forum moderator experience as opposed to the (and no offense intended here) echo chamber responses I've gotten so far.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree you probably would have gotten downvoted, but I dont think you would have been banned or censored. I saw the hostile ban message they left you, and it was unwarranted that they would assume you're young and make the school shooter joke. It isnt justified how they responded, but I think the ban wasnt censorship.</div>
