      <div class="md">I posted https://np.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/zq176p/rick_morty_cosplay_perfectly_captures_the and within the hour I received a message saying I had been permanently banned.

I replied to that message:

&gt;Wtf? How is this spam? I am a fan of this show, this article came up in my feed so I posted it to the appropriate subreddit. How does this post warrant a ban let alone a permanent ban

Did not receive an immediate response and added to my reply to the ban message below.

&gt;It's also not the first time I've posted to this sub. Still, I am curious why you would punish someone for trying to share something here related to Rick and Morty. I did not know it is considered spam or I would not have posted it. Why would I knowingly violate the rules to a sub of a show I am a fan of? If it is the site that is the problem, I searched the sub and see at least one other screenrant article up as of this moment. In any case, the ban is extreme and imo unwarranted and I would like to appeal it directly. 

&gt;And I see 5 other self posts that link to screenrant that are also still up. So how is my post 'spam' and theirs not?? Please follow moddiquette and take my ban appeal seriously. I am still baffled by the out of nowhere perma ban. 

I received a reply:

&gt;When considering how to proceed, first check your mod team’s moderation policies if you have some. Look for the user pane on the right within modmail to gain context - you can see the redditor's recent interactions within your community and all the Mod Notes your team has made about them.

&gt;Low Effort Posting / Fly-By Link Drops / Bot Like Posting

&gt;Try to assume good faith and use the opportunity to turn the situation around where possible. If a redditor genuinely acknowledges their mistake and their intention to improve their conduct, you may consider removing or shortening their ban.

&gt;50/50 

&gt;If the redditor is hostile you may decide to keep the ban in place or extend it. Avoid being drawn into arguments and rely on your team for help whenever possible.

 &gt;• " the ban is extreme and imo unwarranted"

&gt; • "So how is my post 'spam' and theirs not?? Please follow moddiquette and take my ban appeal seriously"

────────

&gt;We consider link dropping / Fly-By posting to be low effort and find that those types of post don't add value to the community. Hence spam

&gt;If you would have taken the time to read the feed or been a bit more active, you would have seen that the Cosplayer herself (who is quite active in the community) self posted the content about a week ago. 

&gt;So was this ban unwarranted: No not really, as explained above.

&gt;&gt;How is this spam and not others: Active and Meaningful participation 

&gt;If you would like to make an attempt at being a productive and active member of our community, we welcome those who want to have meaningful participation.

&gt;&gt;Mod Policy / Handling Ban Appeals:

&gt;&gt;When considering how to proceed, first check your mod team’s moderation policies if you have some. Look for the user pane on the right within modmail to gain context - you can see the redditor's recent interactions within your community and all the Mod Notes your team has made about them.

&gt;&gt;Low Effort Posting / Fly-By Link Drops / Bot Like Posting

&gt;I am not a bot and my post to screenrant is no less effort than anyone here posting an image or YouTube link. By your definition then, many posts here still up are low effort posts. And again, I have posted here before, so not my first post.

&gt;&gt;Try to assume good faith and use the opportunity to turn the situation around where possible.

&gt;I am posting and messaging you in good faith.

&gt;&gt;If a redditor genuinely acknowledges their mistake and their intention to improve their conduct, you may consider removing or shortening their ban.

&gt;Yes, except I am saying I don't believe I spammed, which is your reasoning for a perma ban. Clearly whatever I did was wrong and triggered a perma ban. Tell me how to avoid this in the future and I will abide.

&gt;&gt;50/50

&gt;&gt;If the redditor is hostile you may decide to keep the ban in place or extend it. Avoid being drawn into arguments and rely on your team for help whenever possible.

&gt;I wasn't hostile. I made my argument, you should take my appeal seriously. You gave your reason, please consider my counter argument. I am not trying to be argumentative, if you contest a ban, you call into question the reason behind the ban. Can you only appeal a ban if the user admits they were rightfully banned?

 &gt;&gt;• "Wtf? How is this spam?... How does this post warrant a ban let alone a permanent ban?"

 &gt;&gt;• " the ban is extreme and imo unwarranted"

&gt;&gt;"So how is my post 'spam' and theirs not?? Please follow moddiquette and take my ban appeal seriously"

&gt;I messaged you and heard nothing back for 25 minutes and then thought maybe it was the site I posted to that caused it, so I replied again and once more after to include more info about that. I thought my replies supported my pov of the ban being arbitrary and extreme. 

&gt;&gt;We consider link dropping / Fly-By posting to be low effort and find that those types of post don't add value to the community. Hence spam

&gt;That isn't spam though, I have posted here before and I posted just a single link, it was related to the show and it is to a site that has been posted here before.

&gt;&gt;If you would have taken the time to read the feed or been a bit more active, you would have seen that the Cosplayer herself (who is quite active in the community) self posted the content about a week ago. 

&gt;&gt;So was this ban unwarranted: No not really, as explained above

&gt;It was though, I just realized s6 is out, it has been off Netflix for a while. I was not aware this cosplayer already posted here or I wouldn't have reposted. So now knowing it is back, I would find a way to watch it and want to post more on the sub in that time, but now I can't apparently.

&gt;&gt;How is this spam and not others: Active and Meaningful participation 

&gt;&gt;If you would like to make an attempt at being a productive and active member of our community, we welcome those who want to have meaningful participation. 

&gt;How is it spam? At least one of those links was directly from screenrant, not a self post and I have posted to this sub before last season and I did nothing but make a few posts, yet I was never banned for spam or accused or lacking meaningful participation. The links seemed enough and I was not punished, but now I am? What sense does that make?

&gt;&gt;We will not be community to farm karma

&gt;I didn't post to karma farm. Look at my past posts here, very few upvotes and I don't mind. I like the show, I came across content about it that I like and wanted to share. That is all. 

I have not received a reply back but I did do a search again and I noticed they went back and retroactively removed a post I made a year ago that was at 8 and removed another post that was a self post with screenrant link. Not sure why but they left up my other 2 posts and the other screenrant posts. I really don't see how the post is spam and or warranted a permanent ban. I made effort to explain that I was not out to spam or karma farm and it fell on deaf ears. They just moved the goalposts to participation, yet I participated the same in the past and contributed in the same way and was never penalized. I don't get it. Banning people for good faith participation because it doesn't fit your exacting qualifications at the time? More arbitrary banning, even in a sub like this (non politics sub) is disheartening.

Edit: The impression I get is that I would need to admit the post was spam and the ban was warranted to have any chance at getting it lifted, which is an odd requirement for an appeal. Unless I misunderstand what an appeal is about. I always saw it as you are appealing to have the ban reversed or their decision overturned w/e. Not that it required admission of a rule violation/bannable offense.</div>

    <div class="md">Then they should have just said don't post screenrant and I would have apologized and not posted it in the future. You think the ban was appropriate? You know mods can blacklist certain sites if they don't want it posted, right? Disallowed domains.  At the very least mention it in their sidebar but I don't see anything there about not posting screenrant.

Edit: Also, people share stuff from one site or sub to another all the time without claiming to be the creator of said content or pretending they are when they aren't. Much of the content you see and upvote is probably not OC by that user, it is someone else's content, shared from somewhere else and or it has already been posted here or elsewhere on the internet (i.e. repost), so I am not sure what your point there is. Whether you like the content or not is irrelevant to the discussion. This sub is supposed to be about documenting censorship and mod abuse so I always find it odd whenever a user here appears to defend a mods excessive force and are upvoted while the user documenting it, is downvoted. I am against this crap happening to anyone, regardless of their political leanings. Why am I getting the   impression that the feeling is not mutual? Or maybe it has nothing to do with that and you are just pro censorship and giving apologia for mod abuse, but then why are you posting here?</div>

    <div class="md">What kind of reply is that? You addressed none of my points or questions. So I should just not care or complain when  banned over such a minor thing? Isn't that the purpose of this sub, to document this type of stuff. Not to give apologia to mod abuse, suggest people deserved it and then tell them they take reddit too seriously for making a post about mod abuse in a sub specifically about that thing. You don't have to enjoy posting/sharing content to see that is it uncool to just ban people for so little off subs they have posted to previously and would like to continue posting to. My post bugging you more than the mods ridiculous reasoning to defend the ban, speaks volumes. What I can't understand is why you are being upvoted for it.</div>

    <div class="md">Hard to not be bothered by or to take it personally when I have been banned off so many subs and a number of them I posted to many times and even frequently. I think it would bug you too and you don't have to be in the same situation to see people are targeted by bogus reports, be it out bad faith actors looking to get people censored or banned or angry hall monitor types and mods also inconsistently enforce rules and arbitrary ban over the smallest of things based on political bias or incorrectly assuming a users identity or intent with one look at their profile. 

They just side with these bogus reports because that is the easy thing to do or they have an agenda. But they mod for free and it's time consuming (!) (many users post for free and contribute to these subs which promotes engagement, people coming back and helps grow the community) but then they put more energy into defending this behavior/poor moderation (if they even reply) than they do hearing out the users side of the story, even if a mod is mistaken with their assumptions and reasoning behind a perma ban. They don't care to discuss it or argue as they say, and will only double down if you try to explain it was an honest mistake and misunderstanding. Shameful moderation.

And just because it's not the 'real world' or 'relatively important' (though it arguable is in manipulating discourse and narratives/perspectives surrounding politics to manufacture consent, shield the corrupt and smear their critics) doesn't mean this crap shouldn't be called out, because if it isn't a post to screenrant over a show, it is a political opinion and that suppresses healthy debate, something even you ought to care about. Someone who doesn't put time and energy and enjoyment into posting, probably wouldn't mind being banned as much as someone who does, I get that.

I know you're wondering why is this person ranting and giving me a wall of text. Do they always do this. Yes I do it often. You can see I'm passionate about documenting and exposing censorship and mod abuse and it's something I have been doing for years. I think it's a serious topic and it's a harmful part of social media and harmful to online society and  discourse. I believe in general, it promotes other mods to behave in a similar authoritarian fashion and it promotes echo chamber and division, when what we need right now more than ever especially on the politics front, is open information, healthy debate and class solidarity.</div>

    <div class="md">Frankly, if they have a lot of screenrant post spammers/spambots that they've been instabanning, you may have just been inadvertently caught in the net, and given how prevalent a lot of the spambots are, I don't blame them for doing what they do.

Further, given the cosplayer apparently posts directly to the sub, it's hard to justify promoting a screenrant article about content that could well have originated on the sub (which was then used to create the article you posted).

A lot of the site spammers are insidious, and a lot of sites steal content they find on reddit. Combine the two and I think you can understand why they are triggerhappy with their banhammer.

They may have initially thought you were a screenrant spammer gloating and farming karma from images taken from the subreddit.

And I have to admit that that would not be something I'd be approve of if I had mod powers.

And if you really think your article link is still completely justified when the actual cosplayer already directly posted, I don't know what to say to that because, yeah, it really is low effort. 

You're expecting them to see your perspective but you seem to give zero fucks about theirs. Do you not think they have a point about you reposting something that isn't even from the original cosplayer? Do you not get that s6 has been releasing for months and actually just finished?

So you don't have to care about anything that's happened or been posted in the subreddit, but *they* need to let you post what you want because *they* doubt know what you've been doing the past few months?

They can't know what you have and haven't seen and it's not their fault you haven't been paying attention to the show or the subreddit. Maybe actually catch up on both before you start posting stuff you think no one else has seen.

Edit: Also, ffs, your fucking username is "karmagheden." Are they supposed to be think you're *not* a bad faith karma farmer with a name like that? FFS, think, dude.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, I see their side, they jumped to conclusions and took excessive action. Where is your outrage over mods there not caring to see where I come from? I took the time to reply and address their points and got no reply back. Why are you even simping for arbitrary bans? They could have simply said, okay, so you aren't karma farming and weren't trying to spam, we believe you were posting in good faith, just don't post screenrant again, unbanned. But of course not. They moved the goal posts and then ignored when I poked holes in the inconsistency that was their defense of the ban. And I had honestly no idea there was even a new season out until just recently. I do not live in the U.S. and have seen nothing about the new season in my internet feed, until this cosplay thing popped up. I watched the show quite a bit when it was on Netflix here but it left a while back.</div>

    <div class="md">Edit: whoops, I thought OP was responding to me. Not sure why I got a notification for it. 

Hold up, I said the opposite of supporting the ban. They should’ve just deleted the post and sent a reminder. I don’t think these mods are fair or acting rationally. I’m just telling you likely what’s happening and that they probably have no time to manage exceptions or hear people out. Then when they’re called on it, a standard thing is just to give a runaround or move goal posts. That’s because they really really don’t want people to undermine their authority once they’ve decided on something. It’s not community centric leadership, it’s authoritarian.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't think you support the ban, this other user seems to support it. I agree it's  authoritarian. I wouldn't even say lazy moderation but abuse. Like they don't have the time to manage exceptions but they have the time to give the long reply they did to defend the ban? They quoted moddiquette after I brought it up in regards to appeals. You would think part of it and their job is willing to hear people out. I thought this was assumed under the take appeals seriously part but maybe I misunderstood. Maybe appeals is not the same as contesting/disputing. Maybe they aren't expected to respect the latter, only the former after a user has agreed they broke the rules and that the punishment was warranted?</div>

    <div class="md">At the end of the day they aren’t held to any sort of standard because they aren’t paid and it’s a ton of work and they prob have to work a real job. I feel like the unwritten understanding is that in exchange for this, mods get to wield power and shape the subreddit according to their biases and values. Which goes against the claims that they aren’t biased or that they will hear appeals. The system doesn’t support that unless someone pays these people, which won’t happen. All we can do is try not to cross the mods, try to dodge certain mods and their shifts, complain about it, and the biggest thing is be critical and always remember that Reddit is not a free exchange of ideas, and mods (in coordination with those who vote on new posts) are biased and determine the tone and messages that appear on the subs.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm absolutely sick of the spam I encounter in other subs so I'm actually kind of happy they're being as proactive as they have been. There's been a lot of shit-tier posts in that sub and it's a lot cleaner because of it.

Your appeals read more like an unrepentant, indignant spammer than they do a wronged party acting in good faith. Tone does matter, and, frankly, something about your rebuttals to their claims smacks of evasion and selective disclosure.

Maybe it's because English isn't your first language. Maybe it's the mood you were in. I don't know. But re-read what you wrote as if it was written by someone else, or have someone you know irl read it and see what they think about what you wrote.

In the end, yeah, I give the benefit of the doubt to the mods in that subreddit because I've been there since season 2 and I know how fucking shit it can get if the mods don't keep it clean. The ban may have been excessive, but if you *have* to post random links to enjoy the content of a subreddit, you might want to think about why you believe your screenrant link has a greater or equal right to populate that subreddit than the actual cosplayer's post of the same content.

It may well be that the screenrant article was linked multiple times by multiple individuals and you were the 79th reposter so they were at the end of their patience. And in that light, your inattention to the sub really does matter because you're both admitting you're not a regular visitor and that you don't actually care whether something is reposted 79 times so long as your one time is accepted. And if you were a mod with their power to decide who can and can't post, would *you* unban someone that clearly doesn't care about the overall quality of the subreddit, but only that they should be able to post what they want when they want, regardless of other factors?</div>

    <div class="md">Point taken, but does my 'high-karma' mean my post is automatically spam? No. So you should consider people may get the wrong impression, don't you agree? I think it happens a lot. Do you care if they jump to the wrong conclusions and ban someone over it? This is not the first time I have experienced this. Mostly it is probably triggered by bogus reports and mods give in to them, maybe a quick glance at your profile, pass judgement and they don't care to hear your side or the mod has a political agenda and arbitrarily enforces rules based on their political bias. Basically neither wants to admit if and when they wrongly ban you or were too extreme with the punishment. It doesn't matter how polite and good faith you are.

Did you know there are plenty of other users with more karma than me i.e. users with 5/10/20/30/40 million karma. Do you think mods should have prejudice over people with higher karma and just assume they are trolls, bots or spammers? The meaning of spam varies from person to person. I see my participation as engagement and contribution of content I enjoy and or care about. When I think spammer, I think someone spamming a certain link over many subs or spamming a single sub with many links in a short period of time. Not necessarily someone who posts a bunch of times a day. At any rate, I don't think mods should discriminate but either way, the debate here is: was the post 'spam' and did posting it warrant a perma ban.


Edit: The mod I spoke to said: "We consider link dropping / Fly-By posting to be low effort and find that those types of post don't add value to the community. Hence spam"

So if I don't post there for a while and then I post a link to screenrant for example or some other site containing an article about the show, that is 'low effort' in their eyes (but it is not low effort if someone shares a pic or meme or a youtube video about the show, apparently) and it is assumed it adds nothing of value to the community (how can a mod know this without looking at the content and it seems rather subjective. Obviously if it is a repost then it adds nothing new but the poster doesn’t necessarily know it is a repost), and is therefor spam (except is that what spam is?). I posted there during s5 of the show, out of nowhere, and I wasn't accused of spamming or low effort and my  participation then was 'active and meaningful' but not now? I would have liked to participate there more as I watch the new season but now I can't.</div>

That's exactly my point. 

Are your questions directed at me, or rhetorical? Because I agree with you and only offer explanation as to why the events may have occurred.</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t think they’re very clear with the reason description, and it’s strange to me that they go straight to ban rather than delete. I took at look at several posts in the sub and it looks like they’re all directly posted content, not a link to the content. I’m guessing the post would’ve been okay if you downloaded/screen grabbed the image from the article and then made an image post or linked in a comment right after posting. 

But another more important piece of feedback, you’ve gotta shorten your posts and communications to the mods. None of us have time to read those so you’re bound to get no communication in response or at best you can guarantee that everyone has only read a small part of your lengthy paragraphs.

Good luck out there, and I’m just glad this wasn’t just another right wing crybaby post in this sub.</div>

    <div class="md">I get that my response was drawn out and should have been more succinct but It is hard for me to do this when the reply I received contained so many points I felt I needed to address. Right, it was not clear. I mean tell me not to post a certain site and I won't, but banning me because I haven't posted something here in a while? So I am not allowed to participate or contribute unless I do it often? I'm not sure I follow the mods reasoning here. I think they are looking for a reason to uphold the ban because these types don't want to admit they overreacted  or whatever, some kind of powertrip, they want you to apologize even if it is unclear you violated a rule warranting this punishment and or you did not knowingly violate such a rule, and then maybe they will unban you. It says a lot about the mod in question and It's too bad the other mods go along with it. I plan to find a way to see the new series and it would've been nice to be able to post to that subreddit in that time, but I guess I will just post some place else about it.</div>
