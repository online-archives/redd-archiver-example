    <div class="md">The weird thing to me is that /r/news is infamous for censoring articles that may be critical of Islam or present Muslims in a bad light. Here is an article about abhorrent systematic detainment and persecution of Muslims, yet the mods censor it. If they really cared about Muslims they'd let important stories like this out.</div>

    <div class="md">1. This wasn't me. This image is from another user who posted it on another subreddit. I felt it was appropriate for this sub.

2. You're the third person so far, ever, to get on me about my username. I've explained the username to the two previous people who, hopefully, walked away feeling silly that they'd so quickly judged a person so harshly based solely on a username.

When I was in high school, around 2005, I started playing my first ever online game, Battlefield 2142. My friend that got me in to it, Paul, had a username of ThorsChariot. Being the clever teenager I was, I thought I'd go along with the theme. I didn't know anything about Thor but the first name I found when I looked him up was Loki. It said something about mischief and, again, being the clever teenager I was, I thought "Yeah, I'm pretty mischievous." (I wasn't. I was a straight A boy scout.)

So I picked Loki as the handle, and it's been that way ever since. Then the country got a new president and we devolved in to this insane polarization and race fighting and now I get people like you insinuating I'm a white supremacist because in high school I couldn't think for myself so just followed my friend's name when I made mine. </div>

    <div class="md">Thank you! I definitely judge people too quickly. We all do. We're human and sometimes humans are bad.

Right now I'm just frustrated with how it's being treated on Reddit. It feels like people are treating it like it's a ticket to being super irresponsible. See my failed /r/Unpopularopinions thread if you want to see my full hot take.</div>

    <div class="md">In David Horowitz's book, Radical Son, he describes the strategy of members of a certain political party. They would adopt policies that they knew would be disruptive to society. They didn't really care about the issue; disrupting society would move them closer to the "revolution."

    <div class="md">I don't agree with the censorship of the post, but he does make a good point about this whole China brigade. The way /r/pics was hijacked by anti-China sentiment was very propaganda-like, yet practically nobody questions if they're also the subject of manipulation.

I understand that people are trying to keep Reddit in check, but flooding the website with anti-China posts is EQUALLY destructive to its integrity. By the way, recent reports are saying that the Uyghur musician is still alive, so maybe it's best to get some fact-checking done before you rush to shit out as many post you can about China.</div>

    <div class="md">Anti-china sentiment doesn't make people suspicious, cause basically anyone holding western values can agree Mainland China is tyrannical goverment with no excuses for it's actions. It's like saying some subreddit has anti-national-socialist party of Germany sentiment. Everybody just goes "good".

And it's not destructive as long as posts themself aren't false. We shouldn't stay silent about Mainland China just because bunch of post-colonial powers decided slave work in China is better PR than slave work from Africa.</div>

    <div class="md">Right, I understand that this sentiment is for the good of human rights. But if your gripe is with China manipulating Reddit to push a narrative, then you should have an equal suspicion of countries like the United States who can do the exact same thing.

We live in a world of politics where it can be quite irrelevant if something is 'right or wrong'. Governments can and will manipulate any situation to improve their own standing in the world. 

Yes, anti-China posts are positive. But if they are manipulated by let's say the United States for the expansion of their own power then it should be treated with the exact same disdain. We should keep the political narrative as balanced as we possibly can. If you start straying off then it just becomes propaganda benefiting nobody but the state in question.</div>

    <div class="md">Of course, but I don't believe rise of anti-Mainland China posts is enough to suspect US govt involvment.

More obvious reason would be probably their buying in into western communication and entertainment companies, their treatment of foreigners and rising worries of Mainland China attacking Republic of China.

China makes worrying moves and people getting worried about it is more reasonable explanation than US govt spamming reddit, especially the more left-leaning subreddits which despite being against many Mainland China policies still would prefer non-interventionist approach. Not to mention spamming often makes people care less, it's better to post fewer but bigger stories.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Of course, but I don't believe rise of anti-Mainland China posts is enough to suspect US govt involvment.


It's up to you to speculate. For some, a Chinese tech company investing in Reddit also isn't enough to suspect Chinese govt involvement (Before you say that the company is involved in censorship, realize first that the the company was forced by the Chinese government to allow them access to the company's chat service. It is not even remotely the same case as an investment in a foreign-based company which you don't actually own).

&gt; China makes worrying moves and people getting worried about it is more reasonable explanation than US govt spamming reddit, especially the more left-leaning subreddits which despite being against many Mainland China policies still would prefer non-interventionist approach. Not to mention spamming often makes people care less, it's better to post fewer but bigger stories.

Sorry, but you're kind of talking out of your ass. Of course, we're all speculating here on little information, but this is nonsensical. I don't know if people don't have the same historical knowledge or if their memory is fading, but claims like this have always been pushed and spread by the American media, even with little to no evidence backing it up. This idea that the US government would push such a narrative is not only realistic, it should be *expected* at this point.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, problem is Reddit is probably the closest to US media I ever come across. Problems with China are well known and well documented,  ot everything is "US wants to go to war with X" conspiracy, especially considering US has a lot to loose and nothing to win with war against China. That's why it allowed Commies to even claim Taiwan Island is part of their country or to incorporate Hongkong into it.</div>
