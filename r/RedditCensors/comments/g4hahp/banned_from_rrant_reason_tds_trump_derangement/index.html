Original submission from u/Trumpgodking2020 to r/rant :

&gt; **Title**: ITS NOT THAT SIMPLE

&gt; "omg how dare you put money before other peoples lives

&gt; "BITCH. YOU ARE JUST PUTTING SOME LIVES BEFORE OTHERS. I DONT KNOW IF YOUVE NOTICED. BUT EVERYONE. EVERY. FUCKING. ONE. HAS PUT MONEY AHEAD OF SOMEONES LIFE OR HEALTH. EVERYONE. STOP ACTING LIKE PEOPLE ARE ASSHOLES BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING JOBLESS. THEN HOMELESS. THEN ONTO FUCKING STARVING. PEOPLE CANT AFFORD AND THEREFORE ARENT GETTING THEIR MEDICATION. THEY ARE DYING. DY. ING. NOT BECAUSE OF COVID. BUT BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE ANY FUCKING MONEY. STOP ACTING SO SELF FUCKING RIGHTEOUS AND AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW/WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING. FUCK. PEOPLE ARENT HITLER BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GO TO WORK. AND WHAT A FUCKING INEPT AND NARROW VIEW TO EVEN THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT THE LIVES OF OTHERS. THEY DO. THEY ALSO CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES. ITS POSSIBLE TO DO BOTH. FUCK. AND OH SHIT DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON "lol all these fucking trump supporters" SHUT THE FUCK UP. YOU ARE SO INSANE. SO FUCKING ANGRY AT THE PRESIDENT FOR WHATEVER REASON. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE. SUR FUCKING VIVE. THESE PEOPLE DID. NOTHING. NOTHING. TO CAUSE THIS. YET YOU PUNISH THEM AND DONT EVEN HAVE THE FUCKING BRAINPOWER TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION. "lol you like trump. lol you are so selfish." WE PUT MONEY BEFORE LIVES ALL. THE. FUCKING. TIME. SHUTTING DOWN ENTIRE COUNTRIES LIKE THIS IS UNPRECENTED. UNPRECENTED!! IF YOU THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE THEN FUCK OKAY FINE!!! BUT CLEARLY SHIT HIT THE FAN AND WE HAD NO PLAN OTHER THAN "close it all down". AT LEAST TALK ABOUT LIKE FUCKING ADULTS. ITS A GOD DAMN COMPLEX ISSUE. ITS NOT SIMPLE. ITS NOT JUST "muh health. me no need work" JESUS. CHRIST. ON. A. CRACKER.

Auto-mod notice that the post must be pre-approved due to my low karma.

&gt;  r/rant I have low karma, but im cool promise. **(Title)**

&gt;    [–]to /r/rant sent 3 hours ago **from Trumpgodking 2020**

&gt; Hey. Got an auto message for my post saying its not posted due to low karma. Im not an asshole, I just post on r/politics and am openly not leftist. Idk if you can even see my recent comment history from my profile, but a recent comment of mine of:

&gt; "Nah theres way worse." my reply. To someone saying Trump was the president ever known. Got me a clean -27 karma.

&gt; Even when I post stuff agreeing with a left view, I get downvoted cuz of my name (great name, best name).

&gt; [–]from Trumpgodking2020 via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago

&gt; so yeah can i get approved?

&gt; [–]from awkwardtheturtle[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago

&gt; &gt;THEY ARE DYING. DY. ING. NOT BECAUSE OF COVID.

&gt; 163,000 dead people disagree with you. Why are you promulgating disinformation?


.

.




&gt; [–]to awkwardtheturtle[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago **from Trumpgodking 2020**

&gt; Just read the post. I literally am not talking about COVID related deaths. People arent getting their medication because they cant afford it. People have been kicked out of their homes because theyve missed multiple rent payments. Thats what Im referring to.

&gt; And this is a rant sub? Is it not? Disinformation shouldnt really matter. Its a rant sub. If I want to say some stupid shit because im angry, no matter how wrong, then by the guidelines of your sub im allowed to. Is that not correct?


.

.




&gt; [–]from awkwardtheturtle[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago

&gt; I politely decline


.

.




&gt; [–]to awkwardtheturtle[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago **from Trumpgodking 2020**

&gt; Its not really polite if you dont give reason. What is the reason please?


.

.


Admittedly, I search the mods comment history.


.

.




&gt; [–]to awkwardtheturtle[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago **from Trumpgodking 2020**

&gt; Oh I get it. You dont like Trump. Yikes. Ill give you some credit in that you actually pose decent arguments with people rather than the typical standard "lol ur a racist". But at the end of the day you have the internet privilege of deciding who gets to talk or not, that is your decision, but I dont agree with your implementation of not letting those who are different than you speak.


.

&gt; [–]from N8theGr8[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago **(A new mod chimes in!)**

&gt; Oh man, imagine not liking Trump, the guy who lost the popular vote


.

.




&gt; [–]to N8theGr8[M] via /r/rant sent 3 hours ago  **from Trumpgodking 2020**

&gt; Imagine silencing people who dont think the same way or say the same stuff you do


.

.




&gt; [–]from awkwardtheturtle[M] via /r/rant sent 2 hours ago

&gt; Imagine naming yourself "TrumpGodKing2020" unironically


.

.




&gt; [–]from BaphometsDaughter[M] via /r/rant sent 2 hours ago **(New mod has joined!)**

&gt; Trump is, according to historians, by and far the worst and most corrupt President in modern history. He did jack/shit for 70 days and as a result numerous people have died. He wants to push for an opening of the economy when we could instead easily provide every American in need with $2000 a month until the pandemic is fully under control. He could have done numerous things right, but instead here we are, playing politics with peoples lives due to an overgrown toddler who freely admits he is the same person at when he was as a child.

&gt; So, fuck Trump. I can't wait for history to justly judge him, as it does every president.
