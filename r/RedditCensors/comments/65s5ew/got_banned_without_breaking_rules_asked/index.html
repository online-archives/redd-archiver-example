    <div class="md">There's also other places for talking about cat pictures, but they don't go banning anyone for a picture of a cat.

The problem here is that all political subs are heavily moderated by leftist manipulators working the admins, as has become pretty obvious by now.

So when you actively censor all talks of some content, except in a few heavily moderated subs, you have something that matters. And when the mods of r/celebs and r/politics are shared you have something that matters a lot.</div>

    <div class="md">That's the worst thing I have ever heard. I am sorry you feel that way. I'm sorry you supported someone I refused to have crammed down my throat. I would have loved to cast a vote for the right candidate but unfortunately the DNC betrayed us all. 

My vote wasn't useless, I could not in good conscience vote for either of those snakes, both evil and no worse than the other.  Bottom line nobody likes Hilary Clinton and the DNC force fed her to me. 

As for useless, I participate in my local government and make positive changes in my community daily. Useless, you are sadly mistaken. Uselessness has nothing to do with who you voted for. It has to do with what you are doing to change your current situation.

That comment was hurtful and disgusting. Hmmm... just like Big Hil'.



That was one of them the other one was saying the DNC failed us.

I sent him a message about how the conversation started about Ms.Grande saying she hated America.</div>
