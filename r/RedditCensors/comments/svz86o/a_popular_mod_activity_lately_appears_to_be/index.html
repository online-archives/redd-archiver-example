    <div class="md">... That interview was seriously a huge mistake.

Right afterward the community was full of sadness at the impending doom. (Keep in mind, there was a vote not to speak to the press.)

Any way. The community has roots in deeply left, "literally" Anti-Work stance.

I was a proponent of reminding members of this, and also a proponent of allowing for the expanding discourse.

I think I have reaped what I've sown.</div>
