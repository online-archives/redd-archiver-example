Sorry I had to install my story in pieces like that, but I had to deal with some of the passive-aggressive choices the developers made, such as only allowing us to upload images in the first post in a thread, and only allow us to insert them into text-free image posts like the one I started with.</div>

    <div class="md">To anyone who sees this post, I would like to repost a message I made on my original post, because this was actually one of my most controversial posts ever, and it is something I'd like to forget because of my childlike responses and bad responses (Yes, I am literally a child).

"Honestly, I'm not a fan of this post I made so long ago, and my reaction to people's responses on here. I don't even remember what some of them were about, but it clearly wasn't worth it. And, I think that's why I just rarely make posts anymore, or even comment, to prevent myself from saying stupid stuff. I'm not here to upset people, at the time I think I just wanted to make a contribution to this subreddit."</div>

    <div class="md">Last year, on r/nothingeverhappens, I saw a post titled "Ah yes, because overly offended people don't exist" by u/Hohehathegnome which consisted of the partial screen capture you see above.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens/comments/pbx0sv/ah\_yes\_because\_overly\_offended\_people\_dont\_exist/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens/comments/pbx0sv/ah_yes_because_overly_offended_people_dont_exist/)

This left me in a silly mood, which I suspect is exactly what the OP was hoping to inspire, and so I posted this ... please be patient, right now I'm having trouble cutting and pasting something into this discussion, probably because one of the developers at Reddit thought he had a bright idea ...</div>

&gt;I don't know why typing that felt so right. Maybe because of my height privilege, but maybe because I was listening to this musical classic as I did so.

&gt;  
&gt;"Short people got no reason to live." That line made me tear up, the first time I heard it, so badly that I immediately went out and bought a short guy, a rescue midget from down at the shelter. He was great at learning simple tricks and he was very loyal, but we never did manage to housebreak him, so finally I had to have him put to sleep.  
&gt;  
&gt;I miss him, sometimes, but he did keep insisting on bringing me my slippers when I got home, and that got weird. I think he chewed on them while I was away.  
&gt;  
&gt;What were we talking about, again?

&amp;#x200B;

Getting that into this discussion was no small trick, by the way, because Reddit's system kept removing the text I cut and pasted. There was a way around that which I could explain, if anybody is interested, but if not, let's continue.</div>

you'll find nothing but a mention of it having been deleted by a moderator. To this day, I've been given no explanation of this, but a few weeks ago, I was shown a way of dealing with this kind of garbage.

A friend re-inserted a copy of my old comment into the discussion, mentioning the censorship, quickly archived the repost and his profile in both Archive Today and the Internet Archive, and notified the moderators of what he had done, before he notified me. What he told them was that, at this point, they were going to get transparency whether they liked it or not.

This time, the comment stayed up for a while, until I got around to creating this new account, one that (I hope) won't be in the crosshairs of some of the deranged pro-authoritarian people I was dealing with during the lockdowns. Having done so, I then reposted my own censored content, roughly where it should have been, did the archiving myself, and my friend deleted his copies.

I won a tiny victory for myself, and my friend was being a good friend, and there's satisfaction in that, but a lot less fun than there should have been. All of that work just to upload a silly little piece of prose to a discussion where not many people will probably see it, because it's a year old discussion. Am I glad I bothered to circumvent the censorship? Sure, because of the principle of the thing. But I'm left without an incentive to have much more to do with that subreddit.

Any time I want to get my writing to an audience, all that I really have to do is take the train into Chicago, find an open mic night (like, say, the jam at the Green Mill), pull up a chair and read to an audience that will number in the hundreds, even on a slow night. This isn't bragging. Anybody can do this, and the worst thing to be said about the experience is that one has to pay for the two drink minimum. I get my two club sodas, because I come from that kind of money.

It's a positive experience. One has a great audience, and instead of yelling in frustration at a computer screen, one gets to meet people, face to face. I've read stuff way wilder than the content you saw above, and not once have I seen even the least amount of drama follow. This brings us to a question that I've seen greeted with an attitude, but never an answer.

Why should we put up with the Internet's crap? The cancellations, the gang stalkings, the censorship, any of that? There's a real world out there, with real publications in it, that for a long time has been offering better exposure for one's work that this medium does, and none of the abuse. Somebody is going to say "the Internet is free," but when one has to spend so much time dealing with the control freaks just to be heard, is it really free?

Isn't one's time worth something? How about one's piece of mind? The real world is a vast, complex place, with so much to explore. Remember when we were out in it, a lot more than we are now? When did we forget how satisfying that could be?</div>
