    <div class="md">/u/wolverinesss had a comment that added to the discussion. It was, of  course, removed. 

FYI, wolverineness, the comment will appear for you, but it doesn't show up for anyone else. 

Edit: /u/marquis_of_chaos, could you please shed some light on why the quoted comments below this post offended you and your mod team? Why do you believe that other people should not be allowed to read about racially-related conflicts in other nations? What rule was broken?    </div>

    <div class="md">Actually, he had two removed. Here is a parent comment that had 600+ upvotes:

&gt;I have a close friend who is white and lives with his family in Zimbabwe. They own a wildlife preserve and that's the only reason they were spared. Their land and property were left untouched. His neighbors (wife and husband) were wrapped in tractor tires and lit on fire.

    <div class="md">Here is one that was probably removed before more than a few people were allowed to see it:

&gt;I have a close friend who is a white Zimbabwean. He and his family run a wildlife preserve there. Most if not All of the white people I encountered their either worked with or close to wildlife. It's one of the countries only source of outside revenue and most of these whites have been working closely with the native Ndebele tribe for decades. Their relationship with the natives and the fact that they were protecting wildlife is one of the few reasons many of them were spared. Some had their land taken, but some were allowed to keep it. And these guys are waaaay out in the sticks. I'm talking no telephone, no mail, and everything's run off generators we hunt our own meat (kudu) every day, out in the sticks. 4 hour drive through the Kalahari, in the sticks. It's a crazy place for sure. Over 90% unemployment rate. Most laws are optional. Reminded me a bit of the wild west but it truly embodies the TIA attitude. I did actually meet a few other white people I'm remembering now. They were mechanics.
