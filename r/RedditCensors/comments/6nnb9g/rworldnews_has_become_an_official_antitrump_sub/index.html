    <div class="md">To be fair The_Donald is specifically pro Trump only.  It's right there in the rules for their subreddit.  So it should be of absolutely no surprise that they do not tolerate anti Trump rhetoric.    

On the other hand... r/politics, r/news and r/worldnews never say anything about how biased they are in their rules.  So they are the ones deceiving you.  That's what all the outrage is about.  

It's one thing to declare your agenda as you're being honest.  It's completely different to hide your agenda and pretend to be fair minded when you are actually extremely biased.    </div>

    <div class="md">I'm not going to check your history, but it seems to me that you'd like T_D. It's turned into more of a community lately, one of almost pure positivity, where honest intellectual discussion can happen as long as you're a decent person about it.

Really, it's the only place I can go on reddit anymore and find honest intellectual discourse. I even said I disagreed with President Trump's stance on Net Neutrality and it turned into an honest like three day discussion *without* me getting banned or even censored. I'm definitely a smarter person for going there... though let's be serious, they're also like 95% memes. I do enjoy a good laugh, too, though.</div>

    <div class="md">Exactly this. I got banned from a sub for merely pointing out that the people in there should actually go to r/the_donald instead of listening to the people telling them it is filled with racism and sexism and stuff. I mean, I can understand how it isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it certainly isn't the way the reddit narrative has been telling people. 

Of course telling people not to trust reddit, on reddit, probably isn't the smartest thing either. Especially since you can be banned from subs you haven't even visited for commenting there, the reddit admins allow doxing of its users, the reddit admins have gone back and edited comments(going against their own rules), and the list goes on and on.. But I'll be damned if r/the_donald isn't the closest thing to what reddit was back when I joined.

Damn, I didn't even realize this but it's perfectly accurate. Reddit is swirling with so much hate and negatively lately that I forgot that it wasn't always like that.</div>

    <div class="md">Yep, it used to be fun and educational and you could get in to good debates and remain civil towards each other. Now, it is nothing but fights, arguments, negativity and censorship. 

Thank god for r/the_donald for giving some of that fun back. </div>

    <div class="md">What about that though? I mean all it really means is setting traps. Doing one thing, because you know the opponent is going to do something you want them to do because it sets up your next move. Thinking several moves in advance type of thing. Boxers and fighters do it all the time. 

For strange on r/the_donald I would go with the reverence for a frog more than 4d chess. </div>
