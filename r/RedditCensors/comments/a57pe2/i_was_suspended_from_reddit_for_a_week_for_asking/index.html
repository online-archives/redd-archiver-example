I posted all this in the thread I created to track the initial censorship of the article I attempted to post to /r/WorldNews. By the end of the day Thursday I assumed this was all done, hence my surprise when I received the suspension Saturday morning. I'm reposting the entire exchange of messages here to record the suspension happening. I'd really appreciate someone explaining to me where the harassment is in here. Thanks:



I've messaged the mods with the following:

This post was removed with a cited reason of "opinion/analysis."

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a1ja7u/caravan_mostly_standard_illegal_immigrants_not/

The article the post links to is not an opinion or analysis at all. I even pointed out in my comments how the article was not opinion but rather is based specifically on an in depth study that was even submitted to the Department of Homeland Security who accepted and supported the study.

Here is my comment remarking on the article not being opinion:

*I looked because it's obviously not an opinion piece since it's all based on the study, but I can't find the exact study. Still looking.*

*From the article:*

&gt;The academics used myriad yardsticks to reach their conclusions, including surveys of how people perceive violence in their countries, polling of migrants and their motivations, and employment conditions.

&gt;They asked questions about the cost-benefit analysis migrants are likely making about moving to a safer place within their own country, moving to Mexico, or moving to the U.S. They concluded that few people who decide to leave their home country in Central America will move to Mexico, because the average migrant only sees a 10 percent wage increase.

Please reinstate this post. It isn't an opinion piece. It's based off a real study using myriad methods to reach a conclusion. Reading the article makes that very clear. 

My post links to an article that is showing a study that was done and conclusions from that study, including what was done to carry out the study. The current top post for this week on /r/WorldNews is a post comparing the situation at the US/Mexican border to that of the Holocaust. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a0yeil/auschwitz_museum_on_latin_american_migration_its/

So that isn't "opinion/analysis" but my article I posted which cites a real study with real science and conclusions from that study somehow is? 

Please reinstate my post. Thank you. 


I received the following response from the mods:

*The author is making an inference based on a study as to the composition of a migrant caravan. That’s analysis by the author.*

I replied:

The study concludes that. It isn't an inference by the author. It's a conclusion from the study itself. Literally the first sentence of the article:

&gt;The Central Americans surging into the U.S. and claiming asylum look a lot more like regular illegal immigrants, eager for better jobs or to reunite with families, than traditional refugees fleeing persecution or violence back home, **according to a new report** Wednesday that challenges conventional wisdom on the migrants’ motives.

It isn't the author inferring anything. There was an entire study. The study had conclusions. The article states the study's conclusion. Please reinstate the post. It is not an opinion.


The mods replied:

*The discussion of the research does not suggest it is an analysis of the caravan’s composition, just the composition of asylum seekers in general from these countries.*

*Lest you see this as an invitation to an exhaustive back and forth, we consider this matter addressed. Please do not message us further requesting reinstatement of this post.*

I replied:

The discussion of the research does not suggest it is an analysis of the caravan’s composition, just the composition of asylum seekers in general from these countries.

The first sentence of the article:

&gt;The Central Americans surging into the U.S. and claiming asylum look a lot more like regular illegal immigrants, eager for better jobs or to reunite with families, than traditional refugees fleeing persecution or violence back home, according to a new report Wednesday that challenges conventional wisdom on the migrants’ motives.

The first sentence clearly states that the report refers to "The Central Americans surging into the U.S." That's the Caravan. 

&gt;Lest you see this as an invitation to an exhaustive back and forth, we consider this matter addressed. Please do not message us further requesting reinstatement of this post.

Nope, I see this as you censoring any articles that go against the narrative that /r/WorldNews is attempting to push. You aren't interested in any rules when the article trashes the United States President. Here are a few examples to demonstrate this claim:

Your top post this week with over 100,000 upvotes is an opinion piece comparing the migrant crisis to the Holocaust.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a0yeil/auschwitz_museum_on_latin_american_migration_its/

Another popular post from this week links to an article with the following in it:

Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan condemned the president's comments, calling them cover for "tyrants" around the globe.

"A clear and dangerous message has been sent to tyrants around the world: Flash enough money in front of the president of the United States, and you can literally get away with murder," Ryan wrote.

"President Trump whitewashed the Saudi government’s brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi," he continued.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9zor5u/turkey_accuses_trump_of_turning_blind_eye_to/

Doesn't that feel like the author is selecting statements just to forward an opinion against Trump? Sure feels like way to me.

Here's another super popular post from this past week alleging Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange. The author states the following:

But the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

That's clearly the author drawing their own conclusions. It's complete opinion.

Please explain to me how these examples of clear opinion were allowed to stay up, while my article which is simply documenting conclusions from a scientific study that is explained in the article is somehow opinion. Explain why it feels like any post which is negative towards Trump gets a free pass, while my post which doesn't follow the narrative of /r/WorldNews gets censored away?


They replied with:

*Yes, the first sentence is an author’s interpretation of the report. The report itself is not characterized as describing the caravan. That’s opinion/analysis.*

*We will not be responding to your inquiries in the future as you’ve evidenced repeatedly in prior messages that they are not made in good faith. Please don’t contact us again.*

And then they muted me. So they censor the wrongthink, they ignore the logic, they censor any arguments, then they get the admins to suspend me for a week to hopefully teach me a lesson. Feels like some Russian mob drama where they come beat you up to get you to stop asking questions. </div>
