    <div class="md">I don’t understand OP

Being “murdered by words” usually involves one person making a statement or a claim, and then someone else coming along and meticulously dismantling every single little goddamn element of said statement or claim with surgical precision and extreme prejudice

This is a photo of Comey wearing a pro-LGBTQ shirt followed by a reply from Fitton with nothing but a photo of himself wearing a shirt that reads

&gt; *Because no one is above the law!*


Does Fitton believe Comey should be arrested for wearing a shirt that openly displays support for Pride month or something

Because that’s an admittedly very weak connection, but if that’s not what it is then I have no idea what it could possibly be

Would you perhaps be able to walk us through it and explain in at least some level of detail what kind of clown world you live in where this kind of shit is even remotely considered to be the sort of incisive, devastating and excruciatingly elaborate burn that would normally qualify it as appropriate and acceptable content for a subreddit like r/MurderedByWords</div>

Wut.

This is Reddit. You submit posts you feel fit. Downvotes are supposed to mean "I don't feel this correctly contributes to the subreddit" but instead they mean "I don't like this" and are usually followed by a moderator also personally disliking it and thus removing the content and citing some bull shit reason despite "moderation based on personal feelings" being specifically forbidden in the official Reddit Moddiquette.</div>

Yes OP I understand that you really get off on being offended by the idea that subreddit mods censored you for the sake of a political agenda that they are abusing their authority to push onto the general public, but this is obviously not what happened—your post over there just isn’t any sort of example where someone was murdered by words, and the mods even explained this to you when they removed your post

If you truly believe that your screenshots of these two tweets is legitimate r/MurderedByWords material, then you need to explain exactly how—because all it looks like, at best, is the sort of thing that isn’t particularly funny, or even coherent, but that you convince yourself is funny anyway (regardless of whether or not you actually understand it) because you agree politically with the person posting it 

So first, please explain what exactly is supposedly being communicated here in Fitton’s response to Comey’s pro-LGBTQ photo, and then walk us through how exactly that translates into a verbal murder or burn</div>
