Which was locked and removed without explanation.

Someone replied with:

&gt;Or they think these entities are working with George Soros to turn frogs gay.

I replied to them: 

&gt;Or they accurately think George Soros is a corporatist/globalist, has his hand in politics and is no good.

And my comment was removed.

I messaged the mods: 

&gt;Can I ask what rule my post here violated to deserve being locked and removed? https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/rxvavw/the_masses_have_never_not_been_completely_duped

Then:

&gt;Why my comment here was removed https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/rxvavw/the_masses_have_never_not_been_completely_duped/hrmqnuy what rule did it violate?? Why do you like censorship so much? Despicable.

No response as of yet.

A mod responded with:

&gt;Seriously?

&gt;Or they accurately think George Soros is a corporatist/globalist, has his hand in politics and is no good.

&gt;I’m not even going to explain to you what it is that you’re doing because you know what you’re doing you are testing my patience.

And:

&gt;You’re pushing agenda that’s been amplified by Russians and GQP. I wish you would stop it. You’re walking on thin ice my friend.

I replied with:

&gt;Testing your patience by pointing out a fact you don't like?

And:

&gt;Um, it's not a right-wing or Russian stance to know that Soros has his hands in politics and is no good. Holding that position doesn't make someone a crazy conspiracy theorist.

&gt;Again, you don't care about healthy debate, you are authoritarians who onviously want to stiffle debate/control discourse and you do the bidding of corporate centrist dems - who don't even want progressive policy - whether you realize it or not.

They responded with:

&gt;George Soros the bogeyman. Give it up the community is complaining about you every day.

&gt;spreading misinformation and creating disunity.

&gt;Your posts are not helping the left political movement. I’m getting more and more the feeling you’re here to divide and that helps the GQP and that might be your goal. Yes the Democrats have a lot of issues but you constantly attacking them for no reason and you not being able to see that we have to take the steps we can. To be honest I don’t think you belong in our community.

&gt;Make posts that support progressive candidates and causes. Provide information on those candidates and issues. Stop being divisive, it is not helpful. That stuff belongs in the world of the burn. Your true home!

I replied or tried replying with:

&gt;&gt;spreading misinformation

&gt;Where am I doing that? Point out the misinformation, you have removed dozens and dozens of posts of mine.

&gt;&gt;and creating disunity.

&gt;So you want to thought police people and you think we are going to fix our problems when you stifle debate and people who point out those problems as being divisive and creating disunity. You are working against the progressive movement by doing this and running interference, preventing autopsy.  

&gt;&gt;I’m getting more and more the feeling you’re here to divide and that helps the GQP and that might be your goal.

&gt;I'm not, you're just paranoid vbnmw/bluemaga. 

&gt;&gt;Yes the Democrats have a lot of issues but you constantly attacking them for no reason 

&gt;Valid criticisms are  ≠ attacks and it is not for no reason, why are you being intellectually dishonest?

&gt;&gt;To be honest I don’t think you belong in our community.

&gt;To be honest, I don't think you care about what is in your own sidebar or the message of the subreddit and don't think you are fit to be a moderator of a leftist sub.

&gt;&gt;Make posts that support progressive candidates and causes. 

&gt;I have done that and when they don't do what they ran on, I should be allowed to criticize them and hold them accountable without fear of being attacked and censored.

&gt;&gt;Provide information on those candidates and issues. 

&gt;I try and am censored as this information in your eyes is seen as misinformation or right-wing/russian proapgada, attacks etc.

&gt;&gt;Stop being divisive, it is not helpful. 

&gt;You are tone policing people like Obama has done to progressives, like what was done to Nina Turner, Cornel West and so many others. How the fuck is that helpful? You can't fix rot in the party if you don't address it, you can't leaders to do what you want unless you also call them out and hold them accountable. Call it divisive all you what. What is divisive is censoring and labeling fellow leftist as being gop/russian grifters, I have lost my patience for that.

&gt;&gt;That stuff belongs in the world of the burn. Your true home!

&gt;Is this a reference to wayofthebern? Do you realize that sub is still in your Featured Subreddits section of P_R? 

But was muted so my reply would not go through.

In my inbox:

&gt;All right now you’re attacking me. Goodbye

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/Political_Revolution. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/Political_Revolution for 28 days.

"You're attacking me" says the person who takes away someone else's voice and then when confronted, accuses them of pushing Russian and GOP propaganda and being bent on division, essentially accusing them of being bad faith, then puts them on mute before they can even defend themselves. Jesus Christ.

It's almost as if they want you to keep bringing your progressive energy into the dem party where it goes to die (just cheer for tweets etc but say nothing when they don't actually use their power and take action) and I don't see how they could not catch on to this. If they cared about actually making a difference, they would allow leftist to criticize leaders, or supposed leftist leaders, so that the issues can be addressed and politicians can actually be held accountable and pressured into fighting for popular policy. Otherwise, what is even the point? Toeing the party line, expecting something more than the usual oligarchic neoliberal crumbs? You have to start questioning their motive when they accuse YOU of drinking the kool-aid and trying to cause division to help GOP etc.

If you're curious about the censorship happening over at P_R, I have been documenting it here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/opz4ei/political_revolution_still_removing_posts_for/

And no they don't remove all my YouTube videos and no I don't just post YouTube videos and yes, I've had plenty of content upvoted there, both stuff that stayed up and stuff that was removed hours later without explanation.</div>
