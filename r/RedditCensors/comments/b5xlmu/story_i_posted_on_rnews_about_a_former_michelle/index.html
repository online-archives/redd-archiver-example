    <div class="md">Jussie Smollett being let off for his crimes was the top of the subreddit by 10k upvotes. How is this politics but that isn't? It doesn't **primarily** concern politics. It **primarily** concerns a known criminal getting away with those crimes. The fact that the people who got him out of it were once politicians doesn't make this **primarily** political. The point isn't that they were politicians, it's that they had a lot of pull. It's not important how they had so much pull, just that they did indeed have it.

The mods removed my post because it didn't fit their narrative. They want this criminal to be let off the hook and they don't want anyone pointing out the absolute corruption of his getting away with these heinous crimes. Their narrative is why my post was removed. </div>

    <div class="md">It's right there in the rules, so if they don't like it, it will be removed.  

&gt; The mods removed my post because it didn't fit their narrative.   

And it's pointless to argue because they have a rule right there.  

How about YOU follow the rules, then you will have a MUCH stronger base to argue from.  

I posted your article to /r/politics where it was immediately removed by the automoderator. I am currently contacting the mods for a reason, though I am not optimistic to get a real response.</div>
