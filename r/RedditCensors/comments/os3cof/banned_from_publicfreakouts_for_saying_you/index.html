Meanwhile, here are his comments from the past few hours alone:

    <div class="md">Here are all the comments I made in the sub prior to the ban:

**[They banned me for "spreadinf misinformation is not permitted."](https://i.imgur.com/1LD7dTC.jpg)**

---

As the camera pans right, you realize that Alex Jones is the most normal looking person in this video.

And yeah, I'm gonna side with him here because even though he's clearly upset, a group of fat, pink-haired... people... are randomly harassing him at a restaurant.

Don't act like you do on twitter in real life - it's not cool.

---

You're free to dislike anybody you want (hate is a poison itself), but when you start harassing people you disagree with in public, you're being a bigot and that makes you the bad guy.

---

Bigotry is defined as "*intolerance towards those who hold a different opinion from oneself.*"

It's textbook bigotry.

It's worth noting that language is being changed - this word was no exception as people like me kept calling the actual bigots out.

[This is what bigotry's definition was a year ago.](https://www.quora.com/Bigotry-is-defined-as-intolerance-toward-those-who-hold-different-opinions-from-oneself-Do-you-see-all-bigotry-as-being-on-one-side-of-the-political-line-or-is-it-evenly-distributed)

---

&gt;if ya don’t know that then you’re a right dumb cunt.

Complete lack of self awareness; loving the irony.

---

As I implied earlier, you shouldn't "hate" anybody.

Hate is useless; all it does is poison you (*as you can see from the way you speak to people who disagree with you, "ya dumb cunt"*).

There's never a reason to hate a person. You can seek justice for criminals without hate; you can refute an argument without hate, etc.

Hate is a poison and you should stop bathing in it.

---

A restaurant is never the time or place to shout your political opinions at public figures; it's not the time to yell "fuck you!" or to engage in hatemongering.

As I said before, hatemongering is *always* a waste of time.

I disagree with a lot of public figures, but I would never in a million years shout at them if I saw them out and about in public; I wouldn't do that to anyone.

There's no point in doing that, ever.

There's no point in spouting off at someone wearing a Maga hat, or BLM shirt, or pride shirt, or etc. etc. etc.

All this does is create unhealthy discourse in our society.

If you want to do something positive, fight against big-tech censoring political discussion on the platforms that people like you and I use to discuss these topics every day; where you're free to click "block" if you're tired of speaking to me. It's really that easy - we don't have to scream at each other in a Chili's ffs.

And regardless of whatever Alex Jones said that was stupid (I never paid any attention to him either), he was censored by every major social network simultaneously; that should be opposed in and of itself.

---

&gt;Are you saying if you overheard a person spouting vile racist shit that you wouldn’t speak up?

He was eating at a restaurant dude; he wasn't sitting in there hosting his show FFS.

---

&gt;Addressing the incident in a recent Infowars episode, Jones said he had been eating at a local steakhouse with his wife and Joe Rogan, an MMA color commentator and comedian.

&gt;Jones said his wife wasn't satisfied with dinner, so they ended up stopping at Lucy's.

&gt;"We've been going for many years," he said. "It's a great place."

&gt;He said they sat at a table inside when several people from the outside dining area approached him. He claimed they told him to "eat sh--" and that "we're going to get you."

&gt;Jones said he tried to get a manager to stop them, but things eventually calmed down.

&gt;Later, Jones said customers were staring at him as he walked out to leave. In a video Jones took on his cellphone, the patrons can be heard chanting, "This is class war. Eat the rich and feed the poor."

&gt;The video sent to EchoplexMedia.com appears to start moments after that chant. That's when Jones started yelling.

&gt;"You're the one telling people to eat sh--," he tells one man. "You ain't nothing boy."

---

Well the other people didn't give their side of the story anywhere I can find; I'm happy to hear it, but simply assuming a person is lying automatically is just that: a supposition.

It's not that outlandish to hear that a bunch of pink-haired austinites were harassing Alex Jones and shouting "eat the rich!" I find that very easy to believe.

---

Here you openly admit that you're a hatemonger (*a person who kindles hatred, enmity, or prejudice in others*).

Congratulations, you have become the thing you claim to oppose.

---

&gt;speech that can harm people

Literally impossible.

And yet...

&gt;Fuck you’re a sanctimonious cunt. Fuck off ya right wing troll.

The self awareness of a potato.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Stick to /r/ActualPublicFreakouts where your racist, right wing talking points are more welcome

I guess that's good to know. So apparently PublicFreakouts considers itself left. Now don't get me wrong, I can see why they would think that with their "person says something racist and get's attacked" type of videos. I just find it hypocritical to support left-wing vigilantism after complaining about right-wing vigilantism for so long.</div>

That's not how you help - all you're doing is hatemongering - that was my point.

You don't fight hate with hate - that's not how you make the world a better place.

That was the "misinformation" I spread.

I don't follow Alex Jones, but being stupid isn't criminal. We as a society shouldn't condone harassing people who we disagree with randomly on the streets. This was happening with MAGA hats, with BLM shirts, with random political disagreements, etc.</div>

Not sure what your point is but consider this. Embarrassment is as powerful a tool as conversation. Who doesn't lay in bed and think about how they fucked up in the past.

The difference between Alex Jones and bullhorn guy is audience size and the fact Alex is getting payed to stir shit up. He knows exactly what he's doing, he's vaccinated. Bullhorn guy can at least claim he believes the shit he says.</div>

    <div class="md">Then it would be far more damaging to quietly say to Alex Jones, "Hey man, I've seen your show and I think you're doing a disservice to society for money. I just think it'd be difficult for me to sleep knowing I'm making the world a worse place," and go back to eating my steak.

Shouting "EaT tHe RiCh!" and yelling "*We're gonna get you Alex Jones!*" does a lot less than someone rational calmly disagreeing with you.

And I certainly wouldn't do it while he's out at dinner with his wife. I wouldn't want someone to walk up to my table and say, "*hey, I've seen your reddit comments and I disagree with you,*" while I'm trying to eat steak.</div>

Then all the restaurant staff is trying to get him to leave and he keeps saying he will but walking back to the tables to yell at people. No one is chanting at him and no one is saying they're going to get him.

Either way quietly going up to him and saying some snarky shit isn't going to embarrass him. He doesn't give a fuck about you. He gives a fuck about his marketability.</div>

    <div class="md">The video they posted starts after they'd been chanting at him.

This was in the article I cited: https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/A-bunch-of-cowards-Alex-Jones-filmed-loudly-13720836.php#photo-17132948

&gt;He said they sat at a table inside when several people from the outside dining area approached him. He claimed they told him to "eat sh--" and that "we're going to get you."

&gt;Jones said he tried to get a manager to stop them, but things eventually calmed down.

&gt;Later, Jones said customers were staring at him as he walked out to leave. 

&gt;**In a video Jones took on his cellphone, the patrons can be heard chanting, "This is class war. Eat the rich and feed the poor."**

&gt;The video sent to EchoplexMedia.com appears to start moments after that chant. That's when Jones started yelling.

&gt;"You're the one telling people to eat sh--," he tells one man. "You ain't nothing boy."</div>

I never accused you of harassment so I'm not sure what your point is there. 

You're saying public figures shouldn't be held accountable for the things they say or actions they encourage?

For that to happen laws need to change and before laws change public opinion has to change. That's what you're seeing. Sure it's not the most efficient or nice way of doing it but it's happening. Whether or not the snowflakes can take the criticism.</div>

In what world is yelling "eat shit" at a resturaunt "holding someone accountable?"

And accountable for what? We have an entire legal system designed to hold people accountable.

You openly admit that he hasn't done anything illegal by saying immediately below, "*for that to happen laws need to change[.]*"

What laws? Free speech laws?

Wtf are you talking about??

That's not how the legal system works dude.

If someone commits manslaughter, the city doesn't have to protest to have them prosecuted. 

Absolutely delusional.

And you're not going to sway the public by shouting at someone in a resturaunt - come on.

Finally, you never explained what law you would change which I think shows your hand; people like you are the real danger.</div>

    <div class="md">Chauvin is literally in jail. 

We have no idea what the outcome of the case would have been if people hadn't spent 8 months looting their local Walmart, but 20+ people died during the "mostly peaceful protests" that would still be alive today if they hadn't happened.

Is that an "acceptable cost" to you or are you intelligent enough to realize what a bad policy this is?

    <div class="md">Chauvin is only in jail because of protests. 

This is proved by the last 400 years of police brutality within our country. 

The first case being in 1619, before the pilgrims even got here.

Also Chauvin will be in jail for less time than a number of people doing more time for non-violent drug charges. 

I don't condone murder so I'm not sure why you would bring up something like this as if I approve. I don't believe death sentences should be allowed in any capacity. Not sure where you're getting acceptable cost from to put it in quotes but those are your words not mine.

Looting is not the same as protesting and George Floyd's family didn't engage in looting. I know because I literally work for George Floyd's cousin. 

Bad policy? Protesting isn't policy, it's a right stated within the constitution.</div>

This is just an awful argument from every angle.

Firstly, America is only 245 years old - lol.

Secondly, you can't just pretend you have any idea what would've happened on an alternate time line where 100 less tvs were stolen.

Finally, [Floyd's family literally asked for the protesting to stop if you recall.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/us-protests-monday-george-floyd/index.html)

You take things that happened in the past, analyze them and that will help you determine how to move forward. That's literally how all analysis works. Whether it's science, math, history or politics. 

In the case of America we have a long standing history of not persecuting white people who kill black people. Say whatever you want, that's reality. 

&gt; ...America is only 245 years old... 

Exactly. Even when we formed a new country with a constitution that gave individual rights; we still avoided giving those same rights to black and brown Americans as long as we could.

&gt; ...you can't just pretend you have any idea what would've happened on an alternate time line....

Neither can you. At least my assumption goes along with what's historically, culturally, and politically consistent.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unarmed_African_Americans_killed_by_law_enforcement_officers_in_the_United_States

Look on the right most column. What you'll find is a correlation between nationwide protests and whether or not the officers were convicted or even charged.

If you flip a coin 10 times and get tails every time, that doesn't mean you're going to get tails the next time you flip it.

Even if Chauvin got off without protests, it would've saved 20+ lives - it would be a net win for the people who died.

Vigilantism is a bad policy - looting and rioting is a bad policy. 

If you can't have protests without the former then you shouldn't protest.

It's pretty easy to understand.</div>

    <div class="md">You don't have to be a data analyst to distinguish between correlation and causation. I used the term correlation to allow you the room to draw your own conclusion without influence. Its very obviously causation. 

In reference to the George Floyd's protests: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_and_controversies_during_the_George_Floyd_protests

&gt; ...an estimated 93%–96.3% of demonstrations were peaceful and nondestructive, involving no injuries or no property damage. However, police made arrests in about 5% of protest events (deploying chemical irritants in 2.5% of events); 3.7% of protest events were associated with property damage or vandalism (including damages by persons not involved in the actual demonstration)

&gt; Clashes and other forms of violence were at various times initiated by protestors, by counterprotestors, and by police, and were usually driven by opportunistic criminals rather than organized extremist groups.

&gt;Deaths: 19 Arrests: 17,000+

People aren't going to stop standing up for their rights because there's a couple of idiots mixing into the crowd. Looting/rioting/vigilantism isn't a policy its a side effect of a system that doesn't take care of ALL of its citizens. It's YOUR right as an American to peacefully assemble. Why would you want to take that away from yourself? If it's gone for them/me it's gone for you too.

    <div class="md">&gt;Well he didn't do anything illegal, he's **just a bad person**. 

In that case I don't think anyone has the right to harass him. Because being a bad person is subjective.

&gt;Morality and Law are often in conflict. Laws shouldn't tell you right from wrong, laws are subject to change.

&gt;So I'll just settle for making him feel uncomfortable.

Laws are the rules by which our society works. These are the rules we all agreed to. I don't know the legal situation in the USA, but in my country it is illegal to harass others, for example. I don't think that any person has to right to make someone else uncomfortable.

&gt;Also I don't see him getting harassed out of an establishment to be justice.

It is. These people want to punish him because they dislike his behavior. Which is in my opinion very problematic.

&gt;directly responsible for American deaths through the spread of misinformation about Covid...

Hard disagree on that one. He is not to blame for the stupidity of other people. Everyone has access to the internet, and if people choose to believe in fake news it is their own fault. Here in Germany we don't have Alex Jones, but people still choose to believe random screenshots from Facebook.

That said I do think that this is a problem, but as long as it is legal I don't think it is right to individually punish people. Journalists, random people or entertainers should be allowed to spread false information.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Laws are the rules by which our society works.

Yes

&gt;These are the rules we all agreed to.

Well that's not how laws work in the US. Most laws are written signed and put into action without a majority of the population being aware of it. Like changing copyright laws within the first stimulus package. Yeah everyone voted for it because we needed the money and the infrastructure but they didn't discuss the copyright changes in public. Most people still don't know. Even then the public didn't vote on it, the house and senate then congress did. 

Also no making him feel uncomfortable wasn't justice. That was admittedly childish but damn I wish I was there to act like a kid too. Justice would be him losing his job and being thrown in jail.

He literally told his followers- 
1. To use UV light directly on their skin to kill germs.
2. To inject bleach into their bodies to kill off Corona.
3. To use hydroxychloroquine as a vaccine.
4. Claiming vaccines and other medicine will harm you while passing off his own psuedo-science cures for profit.

Yes, they didn't have to listen to him and I'm glad you don't have people like this in Germany. However in the US if you encourage people to engage in actions leading directly to their death that's called Manslaughter. Many people have been prosecuted for this and is not a new concept. 

False information will always be an issue and I think the only way to even attempt to sow it up is accountability. That doesn't mean lock up every dumbass with a bad opinion. However, if you're making a profit off putting people in danger, that's different.</div>

    <div class="md">Alex Jones never told anyone to inject themselves with bleach dude. 

There are literally Facebook groups where people rub piss in their eyes and claim it is helping them.

They're mentally ill - the people who follow them are mentally ill.

They need psychiatric help - not jail anyway.

And I don't watch Alex Jones, but it's obvious you're misrepresenting what he says.</div>
