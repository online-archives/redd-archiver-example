To this thread:

https://np.reddit.com/r/SelfAwarewolves/comments/rl1eoz/man_youre_so_close_comment_on_a_russell_brand/

Got on today and in my inbox:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/SelfAwarewolves. You can still view and subscribe to r/SelfAwarewolves, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

 &gt;&gt;Dumbass

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/SelfAwarewolves by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

and:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/SelfAwarewolves. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/SelfAwarewolves for 28 days.

I also had my comment removed from: https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/pwkxwo/whats_going_on_with_russell_brand/

My comment:

&gt;Answer: He posted: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k6X03XvxWw

&gt;Then he was attacked on twitter and had smear pieces written about him:

&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/comedian-russell-brand-has-become-a-powerful-voice-for-anti-vaxxers

&gt;https://www.thewrap.com/russell-brand-right-wing-conspiracy-videos-reactions/

&gt;Then he posted: https://youtu.be/RCcKXz1P3vU

&gt;and they doubled down on their attacks, labeling him as a Trumper/right-wing conspiracy theorist and anti-vax despite him being none of those things.

&gt;The article is debunked here:

&gt;https://youtu.be/juGFpAo_7Do

&gt;https://youtu.be/B-Wok9QW8H8

&gt;So the 'what happened to Russell Brand' followed by what is essentially 'he's lost the plot' is manufactured outrage and targeted smear campaign for him covering Russiagate, then being anti-mandate, not anti-vaxx and he is pretty clearly a leftist having stated he does not like Trump so don't let the title of those videos confuse you. I suggest actually watch his videos rather than just go by what you read or hear elsewhere.

&gt;Tl;dr he's on the receiving end of a smear campaign for him being anti-establishment and for his Russiagate video that went viral. Just look how Trevor Noah and Sarah Silverman was treated over what they said (gently criticizing/ poking fun at the official narrative (not always right - just a fyi) and they stepped out of line for a mere second. Brand is off the line and protesting outside with a megaphone. Just to put things into perspective.

I messaged the mods: 

&gt;Just curious why my post here was removed: https://np.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/pwkxwo/whats_going_on_with_russell_brand/hpqmy1d/ I answered the persons question, provided citation and it is no more biased than any of the other comments saying Brand is not right-wing/a right-wing conspiracist. Perhaps it was just just caught up by automod? Could I please get it approved?

And have not heard back.

Edit: Mods of r/OutOfTheLoop approved/reinstated my post. 

Edit: Just to catch you up, I had previously had my comment/s removed off r/Movies while defending Brand. https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/rm6whm/had_my_comment_removed_from_rmovies_without/</div>
