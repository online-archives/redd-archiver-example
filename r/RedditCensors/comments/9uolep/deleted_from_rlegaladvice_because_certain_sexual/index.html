In the mistaken belief that the first mod had overstepped, I contacted a second, but they merely confirmed it was unofficial policy.

Deleted thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9udm9y/sexual_consent_by_deception_texas/

Amusingly, the answer that they were advocating as sufficient is implied to be insufficient by their own [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/sexual_consent): 
&gt;Generally speaking, many other lies are not considered rape from a criminal standpoint. They may open you up to significant civil liability, and it would be unwise to lie to a partner for purposes of gaining consent.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm truly at a loss... sexual preference isn't a choice, any more than being gay is. They are natural tendencies that you are drawn to due to the makeup of your brain.

I am truly baffled how a sexual preference could be bigoted, especially that case being made by people who I guess think they are protecting the LGBTQ community? If they're LGBTQ sexual preferences aren't a "choice," how in the hell is a heterosexuals? The only way that they could be bigoted, is if their sexual preferences were choices. </div>

but here on leftdit, you're not a real man unless you suck a trans while another man does your wife, so... gonna have to wait until a decent platform like gab really takes off.</div>

edit: I can't. just...it's a joke man. I mean there's a bit of truth to it, which is why it's a funny joke- kinda like calling /TheDonald users all nazis or white supremacists etc.</div>

    <div class="md">the only divide is between today's leftists and reality man. I swear it's like children railing against their fathers. seriously, they're all oppressed by their own imagination (and laziness/incompetence often) or if not, they're on the virtue train signaling that they support the oppressed- where there's no oppression. 

which is why they've killed comedy. thanks for that.</div>

    <div class="md">It's hyperbolic but shit if that type of mentality isn't popular around here lately. Every day if you check out enough posts that hit r/all there's A) a decently attractive guy post with tons of highly upvoted comments from supposed "straight" guys all fawning over how they're not gay but gushing endlessly and saying they'd have sex with him. B) anytime someone doesn't agree with the groupthink of being a total bitch in every confrontational situation the top comment underneath is linking r/iamverybadass

That and just other predictable shit that always gets upvoted. Posts going on about how great ladyboys and trans porn is, self deprecating comments trying to top each other on who is more out of shape/has a smaller penis/etc.

There's definitely a trend and validation on popular posts of users celebrating emasculation and bad porno plot levels of stumbling into homosexuality.</div>

Well at least they're not even bothering to hide what unreasonable assholes they are.  Quite ironic that *you're* being called the bigot here.  </div>

    <div class="md">Wow, I'm sorry your post was removed. That's really shitty of them to do. It's also shitty to imply that your sexual preference is a problem.. They seem bigoted themselves. Sexual preferences aren't a fucking problem. 

I don't really have any advice, but I'm sending an internet hug your way. Sorry you had to go through that night, and sorry your post was removed. Hugs.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly, i don't think there is or should be any legal recourse, sorry.  It's already the case that there are lots of things anyone could fail to disclose that might upset the other but which we don't think should yield legal liability.  For example, you might be hooking up with a guy who has micropenis.  Or with a lady who cannot orgasm.  Or with someone whose idea of fun sex is very different than yours.  When you hook up on a first date, this kind of surprise is something you've implicitly agreed to deal with.  STDs are a different story.

EDIT: The r/leagladvice mods should have given you a better answer and not deleted your post.  They right way to deal with a situation like yours is with kindness and thoughtfulness: stop, ask some questions, figure out if this is for you, and if not then kindly end the encounter.</div>

    <div class="md">They have allowed posts like this before (this topic). You can find them if you search the sub.  They probably removed it because they didn’t like the way you worded things (“downstairs operation”) and using “pass” (not necessarily a problem word but can be when used with other negative language) - it all comes off as slightly transphobic, especially when combining that with your actual legal question. Basically they didn’t like something about your delivery,.. because it’s not about the actual subject/your legal question. Like I said this subject has been posted before so it can’t be that. </div>
