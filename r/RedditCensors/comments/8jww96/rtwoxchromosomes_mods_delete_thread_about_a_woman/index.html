    <div class="md">The mods of TwoXChromosomes are some of the most toxic on here these days.  For them, it isn't about just following sub rules, it also has one of those political agendas that go with it as well (that is, unfortunately, very anti-male for some reason rather than just pro-female).  And for them, you either agree or you get banned (heck, they ban people just for participating in subs they don't like).  They're a lot like latestagecapitalism.  Either you already agree, or you don't belong.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; they ban people just for participating in subs they don't like

They actually have a bot that automatically unapproves comments from people who have posted in subs they dislike. So instead of outright banning (which you can appeal and complain about), they make an illusion with shadowbanning.

I've made several comments there, all extremely pro-women and such, but all of them are automatically deleted. My thoughts are irrelevant because I don't stick strictly on their favorite subs. Very sad.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm banned on twoxchromosomes. i only know this because their moderator took the time to PM me saying I was banned for posting on subs they dont approve of. I assume it was the\_donald. It's really funny because the post I made there was very critical of the general views of that sub. I made a reply to someone and didn't even think anything of it.

It would seem as if I'm not missing much though. So that's good.</div>

    <div class="md">I was proactively banned from that sub, even though I never said anything political in there, because they went and found i was in a conservative subreddit.

They literally purged the subreddit of anyone that didn’t hate trump.

    <div class="md">The OP:

*I feel like men get the short end of the stick in being noticed and appreciated. In environments where I know I am safe and in control, I'll make an effort to compliment a guy if I notice something that pops out. Thing's like "Your eyes are super blue", "I like your tattoo", I even went so bold today as to say "I'm married, but you're super handsome!" The looks of genuine, bashful pleasure of being noticed and appreciated makes my day as much as I hope it makes theirs. Spread the love around, you never know when a nice guy could use a genuine compliment.*

Some of the censored comments:

*I met a woman at a party Friday, and the first thing she said to me was “oh my god why are you so pretty?”
I’ve been pretty happy ever since and it’s been almost a week.*

and

*When I was in High School, touring the campus of UCA in Arkansas, a gay guy told me that blue was totally my color and that he lived my shirt.
I have so many blue shirts now.*

and

*Man here.
A decade ago in college I was complimented on my shoes. To this day, it's the only time in my life I can recall being complimented on my shoes.
It felt good. :(*

and

*I got so few in my life that when my wife boasts about me in front of people I get real timid and shy.*</div>

    <div class="md">I was preemptively banned from 2X despite neither reading nor posting. I was profiled as someone who might cause trouble in the future, or something along those lines. So I did some reading to find out what they are all about. Yikes! Only on Reddit could such an unpleasant group find each other. Between its love of abortion and resentment of XY folk it's unlikely the mods there will be breeding anytime soon and that's a comforting thought.</div>

    <div class="md">It's perhaps the worst and most toxic subreddit on this site and that's saying something.
They want to be victims and if you dont see women as victims, you're thrown out. Empowerment? Hardly! If it came out that TwoX was secretly run by male trolls trying to make women look awful, I wouldnt be surprised. 

It's a shithole</div>
