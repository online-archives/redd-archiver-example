Just a fyi, but I am not an anti-vaxxer, and have never been anti-vax. I am pro-vax and have myself been vaccinated. I am pro-mask and have been since the start of this pandemic. I have encouraged people to get vaccinated. I have not encouraged people to go take drugs not prescribed to them. The most I have done is discussed how drugs are politicized and about experts speculating about drugs that could potentially be used to help treat the virus. I am not a republican or libertarian, not that this should matter. 

So I received this just minutes after I posted my comment:

&gt;Hi, karmagheden. Thanks for contributing. However, your comment was removed from /r/Futurology

&gt;Rule 6 - Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence may be removed.

&gt;Refer to the subreddit rules, the transparency wiki, or the domain blacklist for more information.

&gt;Message the Mods if you feel this was in error.

&gt;[Link to your comment]

I messaged the mods, replying with: I have a question regarding the removal of this comment:

&gt;Can I ask where in this comment of mine did I violate this rule?

&gt;&gt;Rule 6 - Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence may be removed.

I then got this message in return:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/Futurology. You can still view and subscribe to r/Futurology, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;context / sub rules / sidebar / site rules / cat

&gt;This comment may have fully or partially contributed to your ban:

&gt;&gt;Right? crickets Edit: actually it's usually people denying Fauci lied or downplaying the lies by Fauci, Biden (both of whom have lied multiple times re covid-19) and Cuomo (including mishandling - see nursing home scandal and him saying he doesn't trust medical experts) and saying it is not as dangerous as when say a certain podcaster talks about a certain politicized drug that shall not be named here.

I responded with: 

&gt;???

&gt;Where did I violate rule 6 and what about my comment there warrants a ban? All three of those individuals have lied over covid-19. That is a fact.

Then:

&gt;What the actual fuck?

No reply.

That was 11 hours ago and just 4 minutes ago I received this:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/Futurology. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/Futurology for 7 days.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence may be removed.

But how is that "Comments that dismiss well-established science without compelling evidence may be removed." Where am I dismissing well-established science?

And I wasn't aware that I needed to provide examples of these lies. You would think it would be common knowledge by now for anyone who follows these things. 

A quick google search:

Those are just a few examples.</div>

    <div class="md">You can't talk about ivermectin or talk about experts talking about it, you can't  talk about liberals being hypocritical and pushing medical misinformation and getting away with it or about people wrongly being censored or you are liable to be censored and banned. Reddit is everything Aaron Swartz stood against and thanks to the authoritarian left, if they are even left. It seems like extreme centrist ideology to embrace censorship.</div>
