    <div class="md">The idea that MassTagger exists to purposely brigade peoples posts to downvote them ought to tell you all you need to know about this liberal site. 
The problem they have is that they thought anyone who wasn't a 100% liberal kid like they are, would leave. 
Oh, they bet wrong and lost, like usual.

    <div class="md">Trust me I know man. I wasn't salty about a stupid 3 day ban in a sub I never post or rarely comment in, I made the post to show the hypocrisy of the sub mods and their indifference when presented with the very proof they asked for. I was surprised as you when people started trying to say I was here to cry about it or I was the only one in the wrong. The idiot children don't seem to understand rules or equality, or much of anything really.</div>

A guy was being antagonistic, malicious, and calling people Nazis. No mod action. OP calls the guy an idiot. Temp ban for OP and blatant indifference when complaining about it. Mods are stamping out certain perspectives by ignoring complaints and temp banning people based on whether or not they find them agreeable.

How is this not censorship? </div>
