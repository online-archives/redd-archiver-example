    <div class="md">Hey, I can help with this one! 
 This comment was so bad that I broke it down on another post. 
 [Here is an archive of the comment.](https://snew.notabug.io/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/ahw8sa/whats_going_on_with_the_maga_kid_and_the_native/eeiwi0l/)

[Here was my breakdown/commentary of it:](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/ahxtob/routoftheloop_mods_allow_biased_and_false_replies/eek6zg8/)

------------------------

Just going to focus on [a top comment there that got six silver, two gold and a diamond.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/ahw8sa/whats_going_on_with_the_maga_kid_and_the_native/eeiwi0l/)

What I find most interesting about this comment is that it adds literally nothing to the story, and confirms nothing.  The guy openly admits that he didn't see what happened.  He's just some anti-white, anti-christian activist who happened to be in DC at the time.

&gt; Earlier I had noticed the indigenous people's march moving toward the Lincoln Memorial, but I didn't really know who they were or what they were about until way afterward when the video came out.

So he didn't know what was happening until the story came out (just like everyone else.)  But fyi the confrontation took place after 5 PM.  The Indigenous People's March took place from 8 AM to 4 PM, so in regards to the law the march was actually over already when this took place.

&gt; I didn't see the actual mobbing of the Native American guy (Nathan Phillips)

He again confirms that he didn't see what happened.

&gt; Did they shout Build the Wall at Nathan Phillips? Seems like it!

We have a livestream video proving that this never happened.  I just find it funny that he can't say "yes" because he didn't actually see what happened so..."Seems like it!"  lmao

&gt; Did they shout Build the Wall? Yes I heard them chant that, although not for any particular reason. This was before the Native Americans were at the memorial I think.

He also contradicts his own timeline.  If he heard people chanting "Build the Wall" before the Native Americans were at the memorial, then how the hell is it possible that it "seems like" they chanted it at Nathan Phillips?  According to his own testimony, Nathan hadn't arrived yet when the chanting occurred.

&gt; Nathan Phillips....tried to get through a massive field trip group made up of students from Covington Catholic High School, a private men's prep school in Covington, KY (that mostly serves rich families from uber rich suburbs of Cincinnati). The students started taunting and jeering him, **at one point shouting 'Build that Wall!' to drown out his singing and chanting**, and according to Phillips one student in particular got in his way and refused to budge, making Phillips stuck. The video of this, with the students heckling Phillips and the one student smiling smugly the entire time while doing so, went viral. 

And this is the meat and potatoes of his testimony. 

Coincidentally, it's all stuff you would get from reading the news and adds nothing additionally that an eyewitness might have seen.  Strangely, he also contradicts his own timeline yet again to include the "build the wall" chanting at Nathan Phillips, which we now have video debunking.  In short, this is a load of garbage, probably entirely fictional and yet...exactly how r/OutOfTheLoop wants people to believe.

Disgusting.

-----------------------

So, if I had to guess....the reason they removed the comment is that they realized it added absolutely nothing to the discussion (besides a lot of vitriol) or maybe, like myself, they are suspicious of whether or not the person posting was actually there that day.

Again, disgusting that r/outoftheloop considered this comment a definitive answer for nearly 24 hours before opening the conversation back up again.</div>
