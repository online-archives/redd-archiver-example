This is against the rules there but mods seemingly let that slide but ban me for calling that behavior out and or making a post about Cornel West running and how both parties screw the working class? Both? I was replying to someone using receipts to address their talking points and wasn't even able to reply, so checked my inbox and sure enough, banned. No warning, no temp ban. I wrote ? in response and was muted for 28 days. So mods there do nothing about these users incivility because their positions align with pro war dem party and mods, selectively enforcing rules and then arbitrarily banning other users who espouse alternative views, which is not what you would expect from anyone who claims to be anti authoritarian and pro democracy. I guess their principles end at their political bias, which is typical partisan hackery one would expect from a democratic party sub not a socialist sub. I guess it's just another extension of democrats and neoliberal sub. Sad to see so many 'leftist' subs go this way.

Edit: I notice a mod later warned one of the users who commented on one post I made but nothing for the other two users who also violated rule 1, one more blatantly than the other. Meanwhile I am given a permanent ban. Still failing to see how that is even remotely fair.

Edit: There was one user who was not offended by the post, who agreed with the message and was also downvoted and when I tried responding to their comment about DINOS taking over progressive subs, I was not able to reply to this comment so I quoted them and included that in a different response to another comment of theirs I *was* able to respond to. I just found that strange. But that could have been an issue with rif and something on my end not automod.</div>

In a previous comment, I made the claim that, by continuing to post what op claims to be quality submissions, op would be back here in a months time complaining about being banned from yet another sub without explanation.

The comment in question can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/11yo0z4/permanently_banned_from_rwholesome_without/jdcbz0f/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) and it clearly shows I had made the claim 2 and a half months ago, not one.

Posting wrongthink around authoritarians.

What are these mods getting wrong when they selectively enforce rules and ban certain people and not others over political bias? Your thoughts on that?

Edit: I'm also getting it wrong to take your bait and be dragged into another argument where you'll probably say, as usual, that there was no mod abuse and the ban was totally reasonable. That the problem is just me and I've never documented here instances of me actually being on the receiving end of censorship, excessive mod action/mod abuse, except I have, numerous times. And I'm not going to tell you to go away or anything but It is curious why someone who comes off as pro censorship, is doing lurking here and you only seem to discount experiences of the users you don't like or agree with politically, one of those users being myself - who you've followed here from other subs - political subs to be specific. I would say you're getting it wrong with that partisan hackery and this weird obsession/hate boner you have for me. So this time I think I will just toggle my inbox.</div>

aka: “it’s the rest of the world that’s wrong, not me”

>What are these mods getting wrong when they selectively enforce rules and ban certain people and not others over political bias? Your thoughts on that?

A cursory glance at your post history reveals that you have been posting multiple times per day in that sub and have done so for, what looks like, months. If it were a simple case of political bias enforced by authoritarians then why wasn’t it done much sooner? It seems you want to portray yourself as some victim of injustice, rather than face the reality that all that is happening is cause and effect. 

>Edit: I'm also getting it wrong to take your bait 

*“Again, everyone is else wrong. Not me”* Challenging your narrative is not bait, it is an opportunity for you to make your position clear so that others may understand it. If you’re correct in what you say, then you should be able to explain it. It’s the response I hope to receive. 

>and be dragged into another argument where you'll probably say, as usual, that there was no mod abuse and the ban was totally reasonable. That the problem is just me 

Well, as usual, I don’t see any evidence of mod abuse and the problem does appear to be you. Given the information I have I cannot comment on the reasonableness of the ban, but from a spam perspective alone I can see why a case might have been made. 

>and I've never documented here instances of me actually being on the receiving end of censorship, excessive mod action/mod abuse, except I have, numerous times. 

Because you post wrongthink? Right? Like you’re just speaking truth to power in a totally balanced and bipartisan way, and for some reason mods all over Reddit single you out to be their target of abuse. 

>And I'm not going to tell you to go away or anything but It is curious why someone who comes off as pro censorship, is doing lurking here 

It’s interesting how quickly and comfortably you want to label someone that disagrees with you as pro censorship. I thought you only engaged in good faith? Sinking to the level of smearing someone because they disagree with you is something I’m willing to bet you complain about more than anything. And yet you engage in the practice so readily. Interesting indeed. 

>and you only seem to discount experiences of the users you don't like or agree with politically, one of those users being myself - who you've followed here from other subs - political subs to be specific. 

So now it’s “users” plural, not just you? And followed from other subs? Dude, you have thousands of posts, from all over Reddit. It’s a statistical likelihood that a person will encounter you on this website, but that doesn’t make you important. Last time you were singing these blues I confirmed you were engaged in this type of rhetoric with other users and on other subs. It’s pretty easy to see that you’re simply being challenged on your shit and that you possess poor skills for handling it. 

>I would say you're getting it wrong with that partisan hackery and this weird obsession/hate boner you have for me. So this time I think I will just toggle my inbox.

*”Again, I’m not wrong, it’s the other people that are mistaken.”* Weird obsession/hate boner is a good one though. How many posts have you made in the last 2 and a half months? How many of those posts have I “followed you from other subs” to try and “pro-censorship” you? It’s like you use words you just don’t understand the meaning of. Obsession has a fairly specific definition and much like most of what you say, you cannot substantiate you assertions.</div>

    <div class="md">This is probably the one situation in which the mods are absolutely correct.  You appear to be a ruZZian troll and I hope you get banned from more subs if not from reddit altogether for your hateful, offensive, dishonest, gaslighting behavior.  Subreddit's are not meant to be a free-for-all where you can say anything you want, and as a result they had every right to ban you from there sub.

Great job, mods!</div>
