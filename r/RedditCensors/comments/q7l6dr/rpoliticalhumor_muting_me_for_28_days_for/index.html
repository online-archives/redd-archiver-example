      <div class="md">They removed a post of mine, reason given 'Not being U.S. politics'

I messaged them:

&gt;I'm writing to you about the following submission: https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/q70m8g/-/.

&gt;My issue is...

&gt;My post is about politics in America. At least that was my intent and understanding. Socdems is a thing in America as well as discussion over reforming capitalism. I do not see how this meme stands out as being non-U.S, I mean it uses a template from a British movie, but the meaning behind the meme. I guess I'm just confused why this would be removed and what would be required for a post to be considered 'about American politics.' does it need to say U.S. in the title or text or name a U.S. politician? It just seems like a blurry line and at the same time pretty stern and yet an easy rule to abuse to remove unsavory content.


They replied with:

&gt;It's not specifically about US politics. There is no serious debate in America about getting rid of capitalism.

I replied:



&gt;&gt;It's not specifically about US politics.

&gt;I was just curious what a posts needs exactly to reach that threshold.

&gt;&gt;There is no serious debate in America about getting rid of capitalism.

&gt;There is and has been a debate about crony capitalism, about whether capitalism can be reformed, whether the political parties and police can be reformed, about whether reforming leads to fundamental change or more incrementalism in line with the status quo that doesn't upset the oligarchy.

&gt;Right for instance, BLM says defund the police and I promote it because it has teeth and we have been 'reforming' police since the 2000s and it has led us here, so this is another debate about whether reformism is working and I don't think it is working, I think we need institutional change.

Their reply to that:

&gt;People arguing on twitter doesn't count as serious debate. We mean debate among politicians.

My response:

&gt;Like Bernie? I'm pretty sure he's talked about this and I don't think he's the only one to have done so.

Their reply:

&gt;Where did Bernie talk about getting rid of capitalism, and what's his proposed solution?

My reply:

&gt;I am referring to him having talked about the need for real fundamental change and how incrimentalist reform is not enough. The point is that this debate is one that has been had by politicians and you are arguing it is something that has only been argued about on twitter.

Few hours later I get this response:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/PoliticalHumor. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/PoliticalHumor for 28 days.

And a message along with it:

&gt;Hi, senior mod here.

&gt;We've come to the realization that nothing we do will make you happy. You haven't broken the rules to the point where we need to ban you from the subreddit, so you're free to keep on posting, but we will be muting you on sight, and I've instructed the rest of the moderators to just not interact with you.

&gt;This has literally nothing to do with your political orientation or the ideological content of your posts, it solely is because you are wasting our time. We're unpaid volunteers, not some corporate Twitter account, and we reserve the right to just ignore things that are problems.

&gt;Have a nice day.

So they will accept and defend bogus reports and arbitrarily enforce the rules (at least one more having comments in multiple threads of mine there calling me names and having banned me and presumably removed my posts), but not with political bias, they say? It's not okay to question when this happens (and it has happened) or else mute and or ban. I have had numerous posts removed from this sub and politicalracememes that seemingly did not violate the rules, and I bet you could find posts that violate their reasoning behind whatever removal you get, but they allow that content up, why, because BIAS? But this has nothing to do with bias! /s</div>

Yes.  All of the big subs are used by the left for setting/controlling the narrative.  You're not allowed to post/comment in a way that contradicts with what they are selling.

Sorry, that's how it works.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't even feel like these people are left, but closer to centrists, especially with their embrace of censorship and authoritarianism. Bear in mind also that these same people who emphasize  over and over how Trump was this fascist threat to democracy, when Biden and Obama were/are just as authoritarian and anti-popular progressive policy, are anti-press freedom and whistleblower, and are seemingly totally fine with interference by political social media astroturf/manipulation, the DNC/DCCC and liberal MSM to undermine and subvert democracy and to stop progressives and support for progressive policy with gaslighting and manufacturing consent. The same people who would say he is racist and a creep but look the other way when Biden is the same exact thing! They will call you hyper partisan for daring to criticize your leaders on the left and hold them accountable, and even when you promote class solidarity over cultural divide enabled by MSM and astroturf out the political establishment. The willful ignorant and hypocrisy of this group on the left (even they are even on the left), is astounding</div>

    <div class="md">Hi. I’m a moderator for other subreddits. I can explain what *might* have happened.

As a mod, especially on big subreddits, and even more ones that gets polarized, it can be exhausting. They probably had conservatives calling them names in their inbox. They can get tired and frustrated of all the people spamming things in the subreddit. They got tired of you trying to argue against them. You were mostly at the wrong place at the wrong time.

Was it fair? No really, it was pretty harsh. Was it understandable? Absolutely.</div>
