Edit, but yes. His comment may have been deleted for many different reasons. Rule breaking potentially being one of them. Or censoring, who knows</div>

    <div class="md">Ahh thank you. Didn't know that. And yes, well I thought about rule breaking and I couldn't think of any. No offensive of vulgar language or something. Just explaining that he was in prison and he saved his ass being multilingual.

And that one guy refused to speak the language there and talked only English. The guards didn't like that en the OP tried to warn him but he got dragged away and they never saw him again.</div>
