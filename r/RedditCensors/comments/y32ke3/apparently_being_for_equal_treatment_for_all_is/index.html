    <div class="md">I would doubt that it's a mistake.  A lot of reddit admins make it clear they support leftist causes, and this was a thread about Affirmative Action.  Also, at the time I was banned, that was a 6-day old post in a private subreddit.  And I had been recently downvoted and banned from a default sub.

I appealed several times and each time just got the standard "We investigated, and you're still banned" response.

Also, they over-wrote my original comment with "\[ Removed by Reddit \]" (the original doesn't even show up via RevEddit) so there's basically no way I can actually show that my response wasn't hateful.  At this point they just could say "It's hateful because we said so."

Also - After denying my appeal, the admins changed the reason of me getting banned from "promoting hate" to "multiple, repeated violations".  I guess even trying to appeal somehow constituted another violation.</div>
