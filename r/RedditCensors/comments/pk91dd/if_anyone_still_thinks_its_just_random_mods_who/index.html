      <div class="md">One of the main reddit admins removed the top mod from /r/news, and removed him from /r/inthenews as well. The admin then made a thread in /r/inthenews titled "New moderators needed!", where they said "Since there is already an established community here, we'd love to recruit some regular contributors from this subreddit". https://web.archive.org/web/20210321223535/https://old.reddit.com/r/inthenews/comments/m0k6tq/new_moderators_needed/ - https://archive.ph/B1oMO

They then ignored all the applications they got in that thread and instead modded a dozen or more power mods, mods of large subs, and one of the most corrupt and abusive mods of a bunch of different subs, who only posts a certain type of biased, manipulative submissions, and heavily manipulates subs they mod (political and non-political) with extreme bias via shadowbans and secret censorship. 

I posted a comment calling the admin out for it. They silently censored my comment and locked and removed the thread. https://archive.ph/dDDor 

Since they removed the thread you can't find it without the link. Almost a complete coverup, like it never even happened. The reddit admins are just getting worse and worse and more and more blatant with their actions. 

Their recent "Limiting Access to Removed and Deleted Post Pages" https://web.archive.org/web/20210615071242/https://old.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/nzvq2t/limiting_access_to_removed_and_deleted_post_pages/ - https://archive.ph/8ol08 announcement would allow them to completely cover up stuff like this. 

Then they recently told /r/WatchRedditDie that "there should be no posts here where users are showing off any bans from any other community". https://web.archive.org/web/20210831110123/https://old.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/pen9rn/removed_as_wrd_moderator_by_admins/ - https://archive.ph/ZN7I0. And they banned /r/The_Cabal *(which was dedicated to covering mod and admin abuse as well)* at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since Reddit is going as far as to prevent users from exposing and discussing the rampant mod abuse, corruption, censorship, and manipulation of content, this may be my last post on this issue. **I have created a related list covering the history of Reddit here**: https://github.com/MaximilianKohler/Archive/wiki/Reddit. Feel free to share important links that I've missed. 

This post I made after the Tencent announcement https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/ has turned out to be alarmingly predictive. 

To me, Reddit is dead. There is nothing of value left on this website, save for a very small handful of subs that haven't yet been corrupted. Everything else here is heavily manipulated and biased. Most of the content is extremely poor quality. And even most of the smaller, higher-quality subs are suffering the same fate of biased manipulation of content from corrupt mods. 

-

**I discovered later that /r/inthenews shadowbanned me for that comment as well** https://archive.ph/r3NpO#selection-231.18-231.19, which is exactly the type of thing the extremely abusive mod they put in charge does - shadow ban people they disagree with/people who dissent. Manipulating the narrative. I noticed that they even went as far as to remove dozens of my submissions to the sub going back many years: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6z1vupt1zcld13p/r-inthenews%20submissions%20removed.pdf?dl=0 (revedit only goes back so far)

I messaged them to ask why I was shadowbanned https://www.dropbox.com/s/1cfro5p40bd118j/r-inthenews%20shadowban.pdf?dl=0 and they permanently banned me https://www.dropbox.com/s/hs6xnrpewev8kmb/r-inthenews%20permanently%20banned.pdf?dl=0 for a completely erroneous and abusive reason: https://www.dropbox.com/s/42qxd7r40ebmlbz/r-inthenews%20permanently%20banned%20modmail.pdf?dl=0 (link to comment chain above)


# Some background:

This started off with the head mod of /r/news having some drama with his other mods, and the admins stepped in and removed him. 

&gt;I was unceremoniously dismissed after eight years as the lead moderator of r/news on February 17th, and am working on a long write-up of how I got that position and how I lost it, and how the content you see online is chosen.  https://archive.vn/0SP9m 

/r/douglasmacarthur https://archive.vn/uGOBu 

&gt;Brief note on r/news drama https://archive.vn/E7qIq 

https://old.reddit.com/r/rNewsWatch - banned for being unmoderated. https://archive.vn/BfvJ0 after they suspended his account: https://archive.vn/H0AT1 


&gt; Requesting /r/inthenews, it's unmoderated https://web.archive.org/web/20210322012658/https://old.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/lzdxhw/requesting_rinthenews_its_unmoderated/ - https://archive.ph/wip/Ul57j

    <div class="md">Telegram is my go to for “dark knowledge” these days, but it obviously will never come close to reddit functionale of community building for less-than-serious topics like some video games.

So basically if you want to find out anything you use anything but reddit and constantly search for contrary opinions and publications so you can get more knowledgeable. Then if you play Fortnite for example you join that sub on reddit and enjoy the community.

The mix of both information and casual mainstream interaction seems to be impossible now due to all the control freaks indoctrinated into policing everyone’s language and intent these days.</div>
