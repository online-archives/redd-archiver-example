Here today on local news we have a man that can't take what he wants to dish out, we typically call people like this spineless cowards who should stay under what ever rock they live under.</div>

    <div class="md">Well... Let's be real here, being a homosexual is nothing to celebrate about. There's a reason why heterosexuals make up the VAST majority of people, it's because homosexuality is abnormal by nature.

I'm not saying we should discriminate against them, but it's time they realize that forcing people to think LGBT is normal does not reflect reality.

LGBT makes up less than 4% of population, and probably lower if  you take away the bisexuals.

    <div class="md">So your point is pretend they dont exist becuase they're a minority? You know the exact reason they're doing what they are doing? "Hey we exist stop acting like we dont" and here comes you with "I dont like it so stop it! You guys are a minority so stop showing up so i dont have to deal with my fragile sexuality" 
You know what also shouldnt exist?

 Finland, they make up 0.9 percent of the population so how about we make sure they dont come up in any media or are even spoken about since the percentage is so small. We shouldn't normalize the finish since they are too small.

Paraplegics make us 1.7% of the population in the us so how about we remove joe from family guy he shouldn't be on tv since there isnt enough paraplegics in real life to justify his existence. We shouldnt have wheelchair accessible parking or stairs or elevators or bathroom since they are a minority right? Since its not normal to be a paraplegics lets just take all that shit away and keep them off tv and the media since its not normal right?</div>

    <div class="md">Oh my god youre full of buzz phrases arent you? Steamroll you? They are rarely in media and when they are they face constant backlash becuase of people like you for existing. 
Just like how there are SJW attacking aunt jemima and uncle bens rice most are not black. Most complaining not dating trans is transphobic are not trans, most of them acknowledge the difference between gender and sex and sexual preference and dont care if some rando wont date them. How about instead of attacking them becuase people defend them you just stop attacking them and they wont have a need to lash back? You know stop poking the cornered animal?</div>

    <div class="md">I went to one of these, thinking it was going to be a drag queen telling stories about herself or friends. No, they were reading normal kids books, in full drag. Given the drag uniform was not particularly Lewd or improper, it’s all above board mate. It’s a library, after all. This simply enables kids to grow up thinking that drag queens aren’t fucking weirdos like they may have been depicted in the past. 

Grow up, OP. You’re advocating for censorship in an anti censorship sub</div>

So already, no.

Also, this is a Wendy’s sir, and by that I mean, OC was talking about people with a particular sexual orientation/preference/kink (dressing in drag) some people have REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE. Those race statistics include people with said kink (drag) who also abuse children.</div>

    <div class="md">1. Most drag queens are White men.

2. Citing ethnic statistics is not a good argument unless you also want to argue that Black men are the biggest threats to public safety seeing as how they make up the majority of violent criminals.</div>

    <div class="md">The money to pay for teachers, infrastructure, computers, etc. has to come from somewhere. You have to pay someone for computers or else they have no reason to make computers, unless you mean to enslave computer manufacturers. Same thing for teachers. That’s included in our taxes. That’s different from a private school where pay for your individual child’s full tuition instead of the large pot of people’s pooled taxes paying for it all.

Also, I live in Florida in one of the poorest counties, and many, many kids were when I was in school and still are on assisted lunches (means they get breakfast and lunch and sometimes even bagged dinner free). Again, the money has to come from somewhere to pay the lunch ladies and for the food and the trays and the disposable silverware, etc.

To suggest that no one cares about the kids because “no free education, no free lunch, etc” is just to be misinformed and wrong.

Do you have kids? If you were an outside observer, who would you bet your money on as more likely to care about kids than the other, the drag queen who doesn’t want the responsibilities of raising a family, or a person with kids of their own?

Kids shouldn’t be exposed to the sexual kinks of grownups, especially in a school sanctioned setting. This applies to whether we’re talking about drag queens or straight people. You wouldn’t think it’s appropriate for a straight person who is in to BDSM to show up to a library dressed in their BDSM leather gear to read “The Hungry Caterpillar” to a 1st grade class would you? I hope your answer is no, you wouldn’t find that appropriate.

Drag is sexual in nature and it is by the very fact that only a very small minority of the population participates in it that it is considered weird and abnormal. Stay TF away from kids with that shit. Simple.</div>

Drag queens are men. They don't even *think* they're women. They *know* they're men! Drag queens don't have the same mental illness as transgendered people.

&gt;drag queens aren’t f*cking weirdos

Being weird isn't the issue. Being overly sexual perverts in front of kids is the issue. Cross-dressing and flaunting sexuality is not a good thing to teach children.</div>

    <div class="md">Why's it so important for children to be exposed to any adult themed content, whether gay straight or otherwise?  They're kids, they aren't thinking about sex, gender, etc.  The vast majority will flow more or less naturally into being a reasonably well functioning adult without having sex &amp; gender stuff rammed down their throat.

So... why?  It seems very self-indulgent to me.  There are a lot of people in the world who lack any sort of meaning or purpose.  Some become revolutionaries, others make their sexuality into the cornerstone (onlystone?  haha) of their personality and have a weird fixation on kids...  Few if any ever think to look inward.</div>

They can't / won't admit it to themselves, so they're overly concerned with *your* supposed bad behavior, and/or how they are the saviors and the good, smart people.  The delusion is mindblowing, it's all projection.

So instead of saying that, I just called him a name =P  It's not like you can get through to those people, so it's a waste of time trying.  Their egos are impermeable.</div>

Tone matters, you sound like you think you have a moral high ground over a decently large group of people, and that everyone in that group is the same. 
If you're going to point out faults within a group or bring up statistics or information, you should probably do it with a nuetral tone. Save the aggressive tone for when youre emphasizing something or making a point using that info.

Calling someone a pedophile is more than just calling names, and even if it was just calling names, your argument turns to shit once you start that.

Your opinion doesn't matter to me at all.  I spoke my mind, and will continue to.

&gt; So you decide to call people you don't agree with online pedos?

In the human mind, there's a sort of "see-saw" between emotion and logic.  Most humans are too strong on the emotion, and that reply tells me you're among the crowd here.  There's no discussion unless you can calm down and think properly.  Sheesh, like children, stg...  maybe that's why you're so fixated on them.  Maybe it's some Freudian thing about the childhood your own childish parent denied you.</div>

    <div class="md">Yours doesn't matter to me either, I can also speak my mind.

I didn't put any emotion in that, it was simply a question based off what you've done so far. It seems to me like you're projecting your mental see-saw onto me. 

You trying insult me and implying im a pedo just makes you look bad. Again, it also seems like you're projecting, but im not going to stoop to your level there. Look through my comment history if you want my opinion on pedos.</div>

Yeah you're doing something way different with children haha

You walked right into that one, seriously.  And you're so upset, sheesh grow a skin.  This exchange really ruined your day eh?  And I'm chuckling about it.  Don't complain about how hard things are when you're weak - make yourself strong instead.

Btw that's why I misread you as a far-leftist, you're weak.</div>

    <div class="md">Sexual and romantic relations with someone of the same sex is an observable phenomenon across all species that exhibit higher levels of intelligence. Examples: dolphins, bonobo apes, nearly all kinds of birds mostly birds of prey, penguins, even gulls.

It is natural and I think some humans think it isnt because we separate it from conventional ways of seeing sexuality by labeling it as "gay" or "lesbian" when it really is just human. Sexuality is not a mental illness, it is a basic part of human nature. Not all species choose partners for procreation purposes. In some cases it could be seen as an evolutionary advantage to keep populations in check, just as some species of animals change thier gender (mostly frogs and fish) depending on the population and male to female ratios.</div>
