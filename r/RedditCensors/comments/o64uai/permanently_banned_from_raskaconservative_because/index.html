&amp;#x200B;

&gt;My theories:  
&gt;  
&gt;A grift to secure more military funding  
&gt;  
&gt;An  anti-Christian psy-op. UFOs are a convenient way to conflate science  fiction with real life and undermine the religious notion that God  created just Earth &amp; Heaven. (the rest of the universe of stars and  rocks is God's flex)  
&gt;  
&gt;Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

and then went on to say in [one of his responses to another user's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/comments/o5tcnw/what_is_the_purpose_of_the_us_govts_new_found/h2otjw7/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3),

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't see how someone can be a traditional Christian and believe in  e.t. The bible is pretty clear on the matter of creation to leave out  such an important detail.

&amp;#x200B;

which brings us to a Fundamentalist Christian conspiracy theory that has been in circulation for a while, and had to be addressed: that if aliens show up, that they'll really be fallen angels in disguise. Yes, we're in that Flat Earther / Space is not Real Zone, and left with the question of how a belief in fiscal restraint should be seen as something that comes bundled with a belief that the sky is a literal solid dome. Or crystal sphere. Or whatever. So I asked this nutcase the obvious questions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So, does that mean if real extraterrestrials show up, that your religion will be over, completely discredited? Or that the rest of us will have to take you out before you start trying to kill "the demons" and get Humanity into an interstellar war that wouldn't end well for it?

&amp;#x200B;

I was blocked within a few minutes, in less time than I needed to type and post my next comment, by an OP who was not open about the fact that he was a mod. But I stand behind the question I asked, because unlike the response of the cowardly mod, it was perfectly fair and reasonable. Usually, when I show up here talking about my latest banning from a group, I'm rolling on the floor laughing. Some of you might remember the time I got banned from a subreddit because I talked about making Coq au Vin, and supposedly that was verbal violence against chickens - that was the actual explanation given by that mod. What could I do, then, but laugh and share an amusing story with you guys, because it was so ridiculous, and because what did I really lose?

Nothing, really - just the chance to post writing for free to a forum that was clearly not worth my time. I got a mildly amusing story out of the "trauma" and went on to have as good a day as one can have during a lockdown.

But this is different. Yes, this is ridiculous, too, but if you think about what is going on and what has been going on, this is a lot less benign. In this case, if there even are any aliens, they're so new here that we don't know if they even really exist, and JungConservative's faction is already encouraging a level of race hatred toward them that would make Hitler's views of the Jewish people seem mild and compassionate by comparison. They are that ready to hate a people we don't even know yet, not because of anything that they did, but just for existing.

That's more than just a free-standing position on a scenario that's probably not going to arise any time soon. It's an attitude toward people and life, and it's a troubling one, because it has consequences. I trust we all know what "xenophobia" is?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same faction that one can see encouraging open anti-Semitism on social media, referring to the Jewish people as "the Synagogue of Satan." I have Jewish friends who will tell you of the death threats and attempts at doxxing that they've been on the receiving end of, since 2016 or earlier. This kind of racial hysteria has already produced multiple mass shootings.

Xenophobia is not victimless, so when one has a mod who is willing to abuse his power to help push that vice a little bit further, I'll mention the sub, the mod and the incident, but this time I won't be laughing. We have a homegrown melding of Fundamentalist Christianity and something very akin to Fascism that needs to be recognized and fought. "I found a Bible quote that I've decided to interpret a certain way, so I get to open fire and silence the unbelievers" is more than a little bit problematic.

E.T. probably isn't here, yet, but the paranoia toward "The Other" being encouraged definitely is, it's getting entrenched. If anybody thinks that's A-OK, go find some of the survivors at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, and ask them what they think about the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As usual, I'm not asking for the sub's help in getting reinstated in AskAConservative. Now that I know what I'm dealing with - a pack of Alt-Right xenophobes, not really conservatives, at all - I don't want to post to that group, any more. But it looks like a good place for others to drop by, and ask a few awkward and probing questions. They are 100% entitled to be bigoted morons, if that's what they want to be, but they're not entitled to be so and maintain the illusion that they're anything other than what they are.

Talk to them a bit, and their facade will break. These aren't Conservatives. These are neo-Nazis, or something very close.</div>

    <div class="md">Somehow I doubt that your very rational reasonings on Christianity’s nutty catch-22 with ETs are going to get a fair shot here.

You just posted on a right-wing subreddit that is chock-a-block full of conservatives, and largely set up for conservatives who had either been caught violating the rules of other subs, or posting patently false misinformation. Or both. Hell, in this sub I’ve seen a fair amount of posts involving _very appropriate_ “censorship” of antivax and anti-mask content, which supremely qualifies as misinformation and fake information. About the only reason why I even bother viewing this sub is that, much like a broken clock, they are actually correct on rare occasions. Because yes, even the far-left gets things wrong, and can be equally as ideological.</div>

&amp;#x200B;

I guess that you're right. I've seen people get slurred in here and been the only person who objected. On a previous occasion, I actually got to watch somebody's report of censorship in a supposedly scientific subreddit get responded to with what was supposed to be a damaging revelation about the OP in that thread: the mere fact of his Jewishness was supposed to discredit him, when he reported an abuse of a moderator's authority in support of a pseudo-scientific theory pushed in one of the subs about the planet Mars.

Now, we can see people using downvoting as a tool of censorship on Baxxb, simply because he has said something about the casual use of the ban hammer as a tool of censorship in Walkaway. Not that I know one way or another if that happened, there, but aren't people supposed to be free to talk about such things here?

I guess the takeaway from these incidents is that the members of this community are completely hypocritical. They like censorship just fine, as long as it is censorship that favors their own, generally racist ideology. That being the case, I guess I might as well just unsubscribe and give up on these people, and quickly.

I think I'll be doing that with Reddit in general, fairly shortly. When the alleged anti-censorship subs keep turning out to really be pro-censorship, that's not a good sign. It's time to get out of here.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;"everyone I dont like is a nazi"

&amp;#x200B;

That's not even close to what I said, and you know it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;you realize using that word alone, discredits everything you said.

&amp;#x200B;

I find the fact that you'd go into hysterics over the recognition of how similar an ideology is to Fascism rather telling, and the fact that you'd lie about what I wrote even more so. The word "Nazi" appears not even once in my post. That's an embellishment, by you. But let's say I had used it, and take a look at how your "argument" would fare under examination.

Quite obviously, yes, there is such a thing as neo-Naziism and there are going to be ideologies that come close to it. When somebody like you tries to order to not notice that fact, logically there can only one explanation: you don't want me or others to look, because what we would see would prove damaging to those you would support. Neo-Nazis would certainly benefit from not being called out on what they are, at this time, and so would neo-Naziism; an evil that will not be recognized is one that will not be resisted. Your leap to hysteria over the very idea that something could be seen as something akin to neo-Naziism, therefore, is evidence that you, yourself, are a neo-Nazi or something not too far from one. One who, rather amusingly, is resorting to tactics not so far removed from those of his supposed Far Left opposition.

That kind of bullying has never worked on me when it has come from the likes of Antifa. It's not going to work coming from you or your friends on the Far Right, either.</div>

    <div class="md">I'd be open to seeing if that was true, but I'm just about done on Reddit, I think. I have a few very small subreddits I'd like to give away, and one last post I've been meaning to make. Once I've got those things done, I think I'm out of here.

But thanks for the suggestion.</div>
