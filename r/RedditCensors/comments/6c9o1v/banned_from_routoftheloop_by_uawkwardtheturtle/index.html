and the original had some reasonable (if heated) back-and-forth.  Most of the original posts were nitpicking why certain subs were in there, and replies were given.  Such as:

&gt;/r/pics has turned into 50% "r/pictures of anti-trump protest signs and magazine covers"

&gt;/r/adviceanimals has something botted to hell periodically, and /r/movies had more than a few early on when the spam groups were figuring out the new algorithm.

and in response to an EnoughTrumpSpam mod's surprise that a defunct subreddit, /r/etsmods, was included

&gt;We have been *very* proactive in using the filtering feature.

and on how it was found

&gt;I suspect it got swept up in the initial hunt for Brock's interns and became the basis of a filter list once the feature got added more generally.

A question from someone out of /r/MarchForScience about why they were in there was

&gt;[Hold a march that wasn't really about science.](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/04/the_march_for_science_was_eerily_religious.html)  And yes, I know it's Slate.  On occasion you find a diamond in a pile of turds.</div>

    <div class="md">T_D has many special rules no other sub has.

1. Not allowed to link to any other sub, let alone any post within a sub. 

2. Not allowed to mention any other Reddit username. Even screenshots must have all usernames blacked out.

3. Only one post per sub permitted to reach r\all. Leftists create dozens of shill subs to get around this. MarchAgainstTrump, r\esist, MarchAgainsTrump (which is different), EnoughTrumpSpam...

4. Sticky posts not allowed to reach r\all. If they would have otherwise, they take up the single slot on r\all allowed to T_D, and no T_Dposts can reach all.

5. r\popular created specifically to prevent T_D from reaching the front page. r\politics and the other anti-Trump subs remain in r\popular.

Meanwhile, subs like SRS, EnoughTrumpSpam, and MarchAgainstTrump openly brigade and call for brigading both T_D and its posters. Admins allow this.

    <div class="md">They're not publicly enshrined anywhere. They've been PMed to the mods. 

Think of how stupid it would look if Reddit had to admit on the site rules page that there were special rules just for T_D. Of course they won't publicly admit they do this!

For proof, look at any post in T_D showing Reddit screenshots. All the names are blacked out. Automod automatically deletes anyone who links outside T_D. Why does T_D do that and no other sub? 

Because those rules exist. The *top three mods of T_D were just unilaterally banned without warning* by Reddit because one of them linked to the subreddit r\politics once. (If a user does that, their post is removed by automoderator.) It's not clear why the other two were banned, but they did it anyway.
