I was on /r/Sex and noticed this thread:  http://archive.is/ApnsN

In the thread, a woman describes how she was raped and gives great advice on how to avoid getting in to a similar situation.  I thought it was a great thread and felt the subreddit would benefit from a my perspective of when I was raped, a story I had never told before.  So I made a thread one evening which is here:

http://archive.is/sYDRZ

Here is some screenshots from my view where my original post has not been deleted:

Part 1:  http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dsn.png
Part 2:  http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dsp.png

The next morning I awoke to an overwhelming amount of support which I was very happy to see.  I sort of expected it.  /r/Sex is a very sex-positive place so they certainly would never ignore anyone telling their story of being raped.  Both my thread and the thread I read that inspired my thread, while filled with support, certainly had some undesirable comments.  But both threads were being moderated quite well and those comments were at the very bottom.  Also, there were not all that many bad comments overall.

Later that morning though, I got on and noticed that my thread was deleted.  Surprised, I inquired as to why:

Messages with mods part 1:  http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dsl.png
Messages withj mods part 2:  http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dsm.png
(the blue is one mod, and the one red name is another mod)

I'm kind of incedulous at this point.  I was surprised to begin with when the thread was suddenly deleted.  Then the lack of reply on the part of the mod who deleted it is shocking, not to mention the fact that there are numerous comments on my thread for men to avoid getting in to the situation I ended up in.  Certainly the mods of /r/Sex would be in favor of ensuring people can get tips on not ending up in a situation where they're likely to be raped.  That's why the original thread about the woman's experience being raped was left up, right?  

I'm curious to know what anyone else thinks.  Maybe they were just doing their jobs and moderating the sub correctly.  I just can't see why they'd pull a thread down.  I mean it's not like it wasn't popular:

http://i.magaimg.net/img/1dsq.png

So yeah.  This was a few days ago and here I've finally sat down and put this together.  Why would they take down a thread about a man being raped, but leave up the other thread.  Why not just lock the thread?  Doesn't make any sense...
