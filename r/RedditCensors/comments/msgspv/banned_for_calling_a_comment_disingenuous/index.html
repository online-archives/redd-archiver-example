    <div class="md">It's not moderator failure but moderator corruption/abuse i.e. arbitrarily enforcing rules to fit their bias and silence dissent/control the conversation - which reinforces the official narratives out the liberal establishment / intelligence community / military industrial complex. You have trolls/bad faith users w/e who help with this with astroturf and brigade vote manipulation and helping to collapse certain comments to kill exposure or keep a certain post in controversial. It only takes a small push to get something in rising and then casual politics goers take over with blind upvotes. It to kill exposure to certain criticisms and inconvenient facts/ugly truths and to control the narrative of what is considered truth and what is considered 'fake news' or 'Russia/right-wing propaganda' or 'misinformstion' or 'Russian disinformation' or 'conspiracy theories.'  Casuals with group think/echo chamber (and tragedy of the commons) will look votes to tell them whether something is true or not and these people may take upvoted falsehoods and start spreading them in their circles, while ignoring the downvoted comments even if they are sourced and contain facts. If anyone talks wrongthink in those threads on the front and brings citation, they will be brigade downvoted and likely ganged up on and  with all manner of ad hominems and fallacious retorts and you may even have you comments removed by a mod or by silently automod while trying to defend yourself and all while dealing with a 15 minute wait to post when you have multiple people wrongly accusing your of being a Trump supporter or Russian troll or literally gaslighting and pushing misinformation to run cover for "moderate" corporate centrists/conservative dems. And you don't just have biased/conflict of interest/compromised mods and trolls/shills/operatives gaslighting but you have bad faith users bogus reporting content to get it removed and often mods of these subs remove content (and even users) seemingly without too much thought, unless they have an agenda. Tl;dr there is a war on information going on and Reddit, just like Twitter, is plagued with trolls/shills/bots, censorship and efforts to control the flow of information and the conversation.</div>
