      <div class="md">Over in r/worldnews, yet another thread about Twitter being infested with Russian-paid trolls shot to the top because NBC recently published a database of 200,000 bullshit Tweets. Read the 50k karma thread here:

https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7xzi6k/nbc_news_publishes_database_of_200000_deleted/

And read the news article here:

https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma

Now read what a redditor, u/CrookshanksTheCat, had to say on the issue:

&gt;Reddit is becoming worse. Everyone on here talks about ditching FB &amp; Twitter. Reddit is no better and is quickly becoming worse and worse everyday. It's just another social media platform full of bots, spam, shitpost memes, and advertisement. No different than Facebook or Twitter IMHO.

Of course, this was far too much for the paid mods and/or dishonest admins, so now the comment has been removed:

https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7xzi6k/nbc_news_publishes_database_of_200000_deleted/duciphf/?context=3

At the time of removal, the post had nearly 2200 upvotes.

If you don't think reddit is manipulated by dishonest people looking to make a buck, then you haven't been paying attention.

    <div class="md">Two side notes. First, I've probably posted in r/worldnews with this novelty account in the past, but I certainly haven't done so recently by any means. Moreover, I used the np URL for my links, so any claim of brigading or trolling or anything along those lines will be objective bullshit in the event that I get banned. If I am banned, I will update my post/this comment.

Second, in the event that the admins get involved to help cover up their bullshit, if my account gets deleted, I'm u/ThatsNotClickbait. Literally every comment I've ever made with this account has been surrounding the word "clickbait". My last comment was 14 days ago. Before that was 27 days. Not counting this comment, I have just over a dozen in the past 6 months. I very rarely use this 2 year old account (and I didn't post in the referenced r/worldnews thread). If you see [deleted] next to this comment, you will know that I was suspended for being even just a tiny threat to reddit's bottom line.</div>

Reddit is full of shills and bots pushing an agenda, usually alt-left and Reddit actually censors any examples of thought outside the hive-mind.

    <div class="md">Reddit is specifically designed for circle-jerks. The founders looked at all the circle-jerking going on and said "There must be a way to monetize this!" and came up with Reddit. They could change it easily (end upvotes and downvotes, rate by views only, limit posts and comments per day from an ip address, actually pay real mods to delete spam, make accounts require a credit card, etc.) but they are happy with what's going on now. They still think that if they tweak enough, they will find a way to make a healthy profit. What is actually more likely to happen is it will gradually fade away as it overrun with radicals and people like you lose interest. </div>

Like Tumblr, I bet Reddit is reluctant to admit it's happening fearing an ad-buyer backlash.</div>
