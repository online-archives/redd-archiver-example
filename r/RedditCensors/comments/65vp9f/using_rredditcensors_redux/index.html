      <div class="md">Since we started the sub, we have acquired over a thousand new subscribers and, by observing how the subreddit is used in practice, gained a better understanding of where some guidance is needed.

Therefore, these are our revised guidelines for using /r/RedditCensors:

- Before posting, read in full the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/wiki/rules)

- When you post, **you need to give us more than just a link**. That means *explain* what it is that is going on and **why** the mods' reaction amounts to ideological censorship. You can either do this by submitting a self-post or by writing a comment after submitting a link.

- Our goal here is exposing ideological censorship and similarly disingenuous modding practices. As such, complaints about subreddits that openly enforce a specific ideology are not suited for this subreddit.

Posts that break these rules may be removed at our discretion. If you have any doubt, don't hesitate to [contact us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRedditCensors).</div>

As long as you aren't calling for a brigade or being hugely obnoxious (like being combative towards the admins when they institute rules that apply to subreddits with very very heated politics such as The_Donald and MAT), you should be okay.</div>
