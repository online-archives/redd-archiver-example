&gt;Lol this guy is basically 75% of the liberals I've ever met. It's disturbing.  

and

&gt;Real quick before the mods lock this thread, I gotta say

&gt;Bill Clinton is a rapist

&gt;INFOWARS.COM  

and

&gt;This is where antiracism leads. This kid's mind is melting down because he thinks he has to show the poor poc that he is an ally at any cost. Meanwhile the black guy wants nicotine only. He thinks the ginger is corny and will never respect him.  

and

&gt;I wish my husband and I (5 tours in Iraq with the USMC husband) lived local so we could stop shopping there. IDGAF if you agree with it or not this free country allows liberal cry babies like you to be offended guess what it also allows red blooded Americans like me to offend so get over your self STFU and ring him out as your job entails. Don't want to do your job someone else out there will...  

and

&gt;"FUCK OFF GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE N***** YOU RACIST FUCK"

&gt;anyone else catch that?  

and

&gt;Damn that scream reminds me of a little kid not getting his way knowing he cant do anything about it.  

and

&gt;When does the soy drinking mod lock up the third thread of the day. lmao Was this you in the vape store mod? Are you having a bad day?</div>

    <div class="md">I used to think that was just a stupid meme, but there was a recent Yale study that found that white liberals actually do limit their vocabulary and use words that make them sound less competent when they’re talking to someone they think is black. White conservatives, however, were found to speak to everyone in the exact same way.

Basically, a massive study by a liberal Yale professor found that white liberals tend to be racists with a guilty conscience.</div>

    <div class="md">The far right people I’ve encountered are racist out of fear and ignorance.  They have never left their town, city or State, don’t care to meet outsiders, and are suspect of anyone that doesn’t look like them.

I don’t believe one type of racism is better than another.  All forms need to be eradicated via education and experience.
