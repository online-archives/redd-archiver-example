    <div class="md">https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/lmo2w9/aita_for_helping_an_old_lady_out_of_her_chair_and/

&gt; There was an old lady sitting down, we were inside in a restaurant. It was time for her to leave so she was trying to get up but struggling. So I went up to her and helped her up, helped her walk out and down the steps (just two) until she was on the sidewalk with her walker. 

&gt; She told me she was 87 years old as I held her hand to support her weight and slowly walk with her. I told her if we hold hands, I can't promise I won't fall in love. She laughed. By the way, we were both unmasked as well.

&gt; Reddit, AITA?</div>
