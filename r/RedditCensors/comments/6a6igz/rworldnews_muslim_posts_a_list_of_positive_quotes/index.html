&gt; I like your name, if we are referring to the same Qubit. 
&gt; 
&gt; Otherwise as someone that has humbly studied Islam and governance I do not think it is Islam. 
&gt; 
&gt; There's a story in Islamic history that says when Umar ibn Khattab, the third caliph of the Muslims conquered Jerusalem he refused to pray in their church. He said it was because future generations would destroy the church and erect a mosque in his name if he did that. 
&gt; 
&gt; Edit: 
&gt; 
&gt; As a Muslim I want to spread a positive message of my Quran. 
&gt; 
&gt; - 2:256 "There is no compulsion in religion. 
&gt; - 109:6 "To you is your religion to me is mine." 
&gt; - 28:55 "And when the Muslims hear ill speech they turn away from it and say 'For us is our deeds and for you is yours. Peace be upon you, we do not seek to be of the ignorant.'"
&gt; - 3:64 "Oh Christians and Jews, let's find equitable terms between us. We worship one God and we do not associate anything with him." 
&gt; - 8:61 "If they [those who go to war with you] incline to peace then incline to peace too and put faith in God." 

Negative response:

&gt;&gt;"Do not greet the Jews and the Christians before they greet you and when you meet any one of them on the roads force him to go to the narrowest part of it." Sahih Muslim 2167 

&gt;or this gem here:

&gt;&gt;The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree, (the Boxthorn tree) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews. [both in Muslim and Bukhari]


&gt;Since you're someone who studied Islam, I guess it's not necessary to tell you it's from highest authority Hadiths for sunnis, basically 90% of world muslims. 

&gt;I'd go on about it, there's plenty of quotes in Quran to show the contrary of what you were trying to do, there's even more in sahih Hadiths, it's just that until you become truthful to what Islam is really about, no amount of back and forth quotes will change anything.

    <div class="md">They also label anything they don't want in their subreddit as "trolling". 

I was personally attacked in their subreddit and responded saying the personal attack hurt my feelings.

I was first banned for 7 days and the explanation was 

*"You were engaging in personal attacks"*

I used ceddit to show that was not true. 

*"You're banned for 3 days"*

I asked what I'm being banned for.

*"You were banned for trolling. Go troll somewhere else. This is a permanent ban*</div>

    <div class="md">I dont know your stats. But even by what you say, not only does the right give vastly more, they have more initiative to create charities. That furthers my point that this notion that the right is anti people is nonsense. We just think we have a better idea of how to go about helping. And if you look at the state of Democrat run cities vs Republican run cities over the course of the last 60 years I think you will understand. </div>

    <div class="md">While I agree that the main difference is both sides think they have the best idea (I'm neither democrat or republican). To say that republicans right now are for the people I think is insanity. They just unanimously supported a bill in the house that is certainly not for the people. For fiscal responsibility? Well you can at least make that argument but that's not what I see anyone saying. 

Edit: oh and with my time at work I actually will look up differences in republican and democrat run cities. That seems interesting!</div>

    <div class="md">You are talking about AHCA? I would argue that that bill is not a right leaning bill at all. It is little more than an amendment to the ACA. What the "republicans" do in office is vastly opposed to the ideals of liberty those pawns would like us to believe they support. But then again, my idea of right vs left could be archaic at this point. Right being proponents of liberty  and the left being for government. Now the left and right are for government expansion to push their belief system which is wrong.</div>

    <div class="md">Well I didn't know how to best find out the differences in cities for democratic and republican led cities. I looked up the best cities to live in and almost all were democratic led. Then I looked up the highest crime cities and again almost all were democratic led. I think the shear amount that are democratic led makes this way over my head without the data given to me lol. </div>

    <div class="md">This. I constantly argue with my friend because he is really left leaning and constantly says he hates republicans. But I support so many republican ideals that I have to try to defend them. But sadly it seems like republicans that actually stand for liberty are dying out.

    <div class="md">Unfortunately you and others failed to recognise I was merely pointing out the irony in your comment. You state Christians can have civil discussion but go on to generalise about Islam in an entirely offensive way. 
Instead people have jumped on me for supposedly pointing out irony in that Christians have been violent throughout history too. I would have used the word hypocrisy if I was challenging you on that front, but I'll address some points anyway: 

Yes, Islam has a history of violence and depravity, so does Christianity. You can compare them all you want, my liberal perspective is that all religions are quite taxing (lol) on society and that their powers need to be slowly scaled back over our lifetimes, this will almost definitely be done through economic means and reduced legislative leeway for their activities. 
I personally hate the effect any religion has on an individual, people who have faith, in my eyes, are merely pulling the veil over after they've realised just how complex and sometimes terrifying existential thoughts are. I also see it as the biggest cop out of all time when it comes to justifying ones morals.
Men wrote holy texts, not a god, it's ridiculous to use your holy text as a crutch to support your views as it simply is not and will never be the ultimate source of truth. 

Imagine a world without religion...

    <div class="md">Yeah, all Muslims I've ever debated with have been super friendly to me. I've shared meals, weed and good times with Muslims and they know of my opposition to a lot of their morals and beliefs but were perfectly capable of putting that aside to simply be a human with me. I've come across Christians who are the same, but I've also come across Christians who are grossly outspoken when it comes to this and couldn't put it to one side when interacting with me and inevitably came across as assholes, simply put. I'm certain there are Muslims of this variety as well, I guess I just haven't met enough yet.

    <div class="md">Because Christians have no other choice.

They could do whatever they wanted, but then the renaissance came along, countries got separation of church and state, and if they tried to do something, they would be repercussions.

Islam is not affected by this because Islam is both religion and state. It's not something one can argue based on interpretations of very old texts. It has been written as such. It's designed to control every aspect of life, and to prevent its alteration and moderation.

The Qur'an is essentially a manual for world domination. This is not something some dude on a computer is telling you. It is something non-muslim arabs and ex-muslims warn about. And I consider prudent to believe those who have suffered Islam over wealthy people who claim to be defending  "social justice" while forgetting to defend the actual people who make that society. </div>

    <div class="md">The percentage of republicans and conservatives who are that idiotic and inhumane, I can guarantee you, is much lower than the percentage of delusional liberals and democrats. 

There's a big difference in prejudice and racism between wanting to kill all blacks, and walking on the other side if the road, for instance. Racism isn't black and white (pun intended), it's literally just a collection of observed and learned biases against a certain race or group of people. Want to end negative racism? Stop promoting the shittiest parts of these people's cultures; this applies to any race.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah sure, as long as you understand how extremely way off the remark that the worst comments come from liberals was. And the people wanting to kill all Muslims or carpet bomb the whole middle east are not as few as you're trying to make it out to be. Plenty of them in r/uncensorednews and The Donald. There's a difference between crazy people who want to share bathrooms with the other gender, and crazy people who want mass genocide of a third of the humans on earth. </div>

    <div class="md">To be fair I did not mention a desire to kill Muslims. People in America understand black people in the sense that they oftentimes come from the shittiest parts of the country and with a rough history. To me and absolutely every other conservative I know there's no greater example of the American dream than in a black kid _trying_ to succeed. 

Muslims are something more unknown and distant. Everyone has a black friend but few have a Muslim friend. I make passing jokes about glassing the Middle East as well.. I'm not going to pretend it's not a bad situation.  
The problem is that the "left" won't come to terms with the simple fact that a vast majority of Muslims inside their own countries as well as a frighteningly large majority of Muslims inside a western countries simply do not hold values compatible with our way of life. I don't want my gay friends to be executed; I don't want my girlfriend to need to cover herself when she leave the house; I don't want to die for being a Christian. I don't want their laws to supersede the laws of my government and state. I don't want to be harmed for insulting Allah. And if you look it up (or ask me to - mobile) you'll find that more numbers than I'm comfortable with do not hold at least the above values.

That is the extent to which I am spiteful towards Muslims I haven't met, and it is why I supported lawful travel bans until we can figure out a better way to go through this shit. I say haven't met because prejudice is always overpowered by reality. There's a Muslim family that runs a pizza shop I've been to a few times - absolutely the most accommodating and lovely people. But I do not know the extent to which they hold their religion, and based on statistics I've read over, I do not want to start that conversation. </div>

    <div class="md">That's cool. Sounds like you're​ on the way to looking at things objectively. Yes there are many values in developing countries which are inconsistent with western values. Many of those developing countries are Muslim, but there are also plenty of Christian countries with horrible values and laws. 

That's why we have to vet individuals, not religions. If they ban Muslims but let tons of gay hating woman abusing Christians in then they've failed. Religion is just a very sucky metric to judge an individual by. Individuals apply for green cards, and it's made clear that western values of democracy, freedom and equality are what people are signing up for when they move. If the individual is not fit for that and has no good reason to enter, he shouldn't be let in.

Also, the opposite of religious ignorance isn't cultural ignorance, it's education and enlightenment. The American schoolsystem needs a haul over.</div>

    <div class="md">I try to be objective, but honest with myself. Thanks.

For me I can agree that we should be vetting based on individual values rather than generalizing by religious values, but I believe you can gauge personal values from religious ones. I'm not going to say that Christianity is perfect now or in the past, but most recently the majority of conflicts between religion and modern world living have _not_ risen due to Christianity. Again -- Christianity, like most religions, has done some horrible things in the past, and some people still use it as an excuse to do horrible things today. But it has adapted to the modern world very well. Most western countries have roots in Catholicism or Christianity through which these lands are governed, and I would say it's working out well.  
You want to go to a tolerable land to find acceptance for your family? You go to Britain. Or Germany. Or Canada, or the US, etc. If I'm a gay Christian looking to get married, you think I'm going to have it in Saudi Arabia? 

I guess what I'm getting at is that I believe the Muslim religion needs a reformation such that it becomes a religion that tolerates various ideas and personalities akin to modern-day Christianity. I firmly believe that the difference between these two religions is that the average intolerable Christian (usually characterized as a Redneck) will look at a gay couple and say "hey man who cares let the fags get married", whereas the average intolerable Muslim would have them tried under their own laws and executed.

Maybe I have an entirely wrong perception. I'm open to that. But until I see the same sort of tolerance and acceptance emanating from Muslim countries that comes out of Western (predominantly Christian/Catholic) countries, I will continue to believe that the religion needs work.</div>

    <div class="md">Interesting points.

I think what you will see correlates more clearly with western values is *lack* of religion instead of any specific religion. The most progressive countries are the least religious in general.

When talking about intolerable Christians you are forgetting about a whole continent. A redneck American and a redneck Rwandan I think will have quite different Christian values. Christian country Uganda kills gays.

So you can use Africa as an example to compare countries on a similar level but with different religions. Rwanda, Uganda or Ghana etc can let you compare them to U.A.E. or other muslim countries.

I don't mean to criticize Christianity, any religion if used right can be great. But being open minded I think maybe africa is the key you're looking for if you want to make fair comparisons. 

As I said it seems to be a lot about culture and the *lack* of religion.</div>

    <div class="md">I suppose you're right in that comparisons could be a bit fairer, but I'm primarily concerned with modern countries and their relationships with these predominantly Muslim countries. I guess you could say I'm privileged in that regard -- or maybe I'm falling into a NoTrueScottsman fallacy in saying that the _modern_ Christianity is the real one -- i.e. no true Christian would do something so horrendous, whereas Muslims would not scoff at Chechnya creating concentration camps for gays.

I do agree with the fact that part of western values is toleration of other religions. I don't mean to imply that the countries I mentioned previously are solely Catholic/Christian, rather that these countries have roots that have allowed these countries to grow into rather peaceful and tolerable places, whereas middle eastern countries with Muslim roots aren't as..attractive, per se. 

As for the African continent as a whole -- I can't comment because I don't really have much clue about their religion or upbringing. The countries I mentioned before have roots in these Catholic-esque religions for, I believe, thousands of years, whereas a brief glance at Wikipedia suggests that African countries have deep roots in their own religions, and most of the recent high-catholic statistics are the result of vigorous missionary work: work which, so recent, probably will not be able to change deep-seated intolerance in their culture. At least not for some time. 

As an aside, thanks for speaking at length with this. Helps me realize my true thoughts/feelings on the matter. </div>

    <div class="md">Interesting thinking about deeper cultural roots behind religion. The culture of our religion is of course originally middle eastern, but it has evolved as it has spread over the world. 

One thing to recall is also that our western ideas of tolerance and equality are quite new even to us. Only the past 70 years have they truly evolved. 

What did we do before that? Well, let's not forget Christians  invaded basically every country on the planet and killed and raped and dominated the local populations of the whole earth. I don't mean this in an especially negative sense, it's just expanding on what all humans had been doing for thousands of years before. But let's not pretend that Christians didn't do it more than any other.

So what happened to trigger our age of relative justice, peace and tolerance? Well first after hundreds of years of constant wars we came to the point where we slaughtered almost an entire generation of millions upon millions of young men on an industrial scale in just one war. Then with the next generation we did it again even worse. With truly industrial methods of mass-slaughter wiping out whole populations in a destructive global chaos never before seen in history.

Until we reached a level of technology where we realised we will actually wipe out the entire human race if we continue. That is where we're at now. We know that the next big war can end humanity. So we better get tolerant. There hasn't been a proper war between major powers since ww2 and the age of the nuclear bomb started. We've just fought proxy wars in the Middle East.

So the people there haven't gone through this massive harrowing violence which we did, wiping out entire generations. So their thinking is still kind of stuck where ours was before all our men killed each other. 

Yes we are more culturally developed, but we got there through unprecedented bloodshed. And if we misstep again humanity as we know it will be lost. Geographical and historical perspective can help a lot in understanding where we are now.</div>

    <div class="md">I suppose we won't know until we get there. I would say that that Muslim countries have militaries capable of wiping each other out, but from a global perspective, are unable to do so. The geopolitical atmosphere over there isn't something I'm entirely familiar with, but I can't imagine that the world would sit idly by as these countries attacked each other indiscriminately, or waged all-out war.  
In short, to say that these countries haven't at the very least realized their own mortality, I think, would be false. Only time will tell if these countries adopt a new moral ground that preserves _all_ human life.</div>

    <div class="md">The liberal view is that all religions have amazing wonderful things and all have awful shit in them. What I believe most of us are trying to say is that how can we say they're all bad just because we have finally decided to say fuck it to our bad shit and a good bit of them haven't yet? It's almost as if we want to fucking start another crusade on them. And in this whole "fuck Islam they're the worst people, etc." mindset are you not essentially being like them? For fuck sake, look in the mirror. Do you want to lead by example or be like them? If you find evil in people it's because evil is there guiding you. If you see the good in others it's because you yourself are good. </div>

    <div class="md">The liberal view is exactly what you describe, and it's horseshit.

1. Do you know what the crusade was or only that it caused large amounts of people to die?

2. No one believes Islam are the worst people because "Islam" does not describe people. It's a set of ideas that are the worst.

3. We are already like them. They are just people who are exactly like we are. We have extreme Christians, atheists, and feminists. The difference is the behaviour.

4. I'm not convinced leading by example will deter the desires of the people we only think we're leading.

5. If you think Islam is harmless that is because you are harmless.</div>

If I say "Islam is bad" and you respond by telling me "Yes but we are bad too" then you are simply agreeing with me in the stupidest way possible.

You haven't made a case for the liberal position at all.  Asking hypothetical questions because you think it sounds convincing isn't the same thing as making an argument.  Actually that summarizes the liberal position pretty well.  No arguments, just a condescending tone while repeating "c'mon, C'MON" over and over again.</div>

    <div class="md">His argument was: Christians have slaughtered far far more innocent Muslims than the other way around. And there are plenty of Christians who treat women like animals and execute gays in the name of God. 

It seems as if you're stuck on a detail explaining human behaviour and acting as if it's significant because you're emotionally upset about how foreign it feels to you. Abrahamic religions are all crap, let's focus on criticizing more concrete things like behaviour and specific culture instead. There's plenty to criticize about different backwards cultures, Islamic and Christian alike.</div>

    <div class="md">1. Christians aren't really known for abusing human rights. If you're concerned at the way women and gays are treated then you should prefer Christianity to Islam.

2. Muslims are known for far more death than Christians. They aren't exactly diverse because they castrated and slaughtered their slaves instead of freeing them.

3. You don't know my motives, I'm concerned about behaviour because that is far more significant than how crappy a belief may or may not be.

4. If your point is that Christians are just as bad as Muslims then you're actually just agreeing with me in the stupidest way possible. I'm glad we can both agree that Islam is bad.

Islam is the worst. Christianity is irrelelavent to this discussion.

    <div class="md">I don't think you're getting the point.  Islam is not something we can be liberal about and it isn't comparable to Christianity.  The results of Islam are vastly different then that of Christianity.  Regardless, this is really about whether or not we can accept Islam within western culture.  The answer is obviously no.  I reject the argument that Islam is acceptable within western culture because we already accept Christianity so there would be nothing different than we already have.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes I understand your point. It is unfortunately undemocratic and you would probably feel more at home with your opinions in Iran or Saudi Arabia. Here in the west we have freedom of religion and other democratic values to uphold. So this mentality you're stuck on now is just as dangerous to western culture as fanatical Islam. We must be clear on our democratic values and fight bigotry in all forms, be they religious or political like yours. 

Yes, fanatical religion is bad. Because of intolerance and discrimination. We don't fight that with more intolerance and discrimination.</div>

    <div class="md">Here in the west we have freedoms that religion and democracy cannot infringe upon.  I think an anti-Islam view would not go over very well in a dictatorship or theocracy.  You know nothing or Iran or Saudi Arabia.  Here in the west we have rights that provide freedoms from the democracy.  A democracy cannot infringe upon our rights. That is why we have a republic within the United States and a monarchy in commonwealth countries.  The republic and the crown will not allow a democracy to rule for fear it becomes tyrannical.  We do not fight for democratic values and instead we fight for individual rights.  We must be clear on our individual rights and fight those who wish to remove them from us, be they religious or political.  The 2nd amendment allows those within the United States to fight for their individual rights even in the event that their own country attempts to deny these rights.  If the government attempts to remove your freedom of speech then use your gun to kill them.  That's why the 2nd amendment exists in the first place.

This liberal mentality you have is dangerous to our way of life.  As a people we fight, kill, and die for these values.  We wage war to ensure our rights are protected.  We will not allow a religion or an individual to deny us our rights.  If Islam wants to deny our rights then we will not welcome it within our borders.  We will fight, kill, and die to ensure values such as rule of law, freedom of speech and a public trial are respected.

We agree that fanatical religion is bad.  Anything fanatical is bad.  I believe moderate Islam is bad because it violates the god-given rights of the individual.  Those are both constitutional rights as well as human rights.  Christianity has no desire to do these things and is very compatible with the constitutional and human rights we have recognized.  Islam is not compatible or welcome within western society and rightfully so.  We literally kill people who attempt to remove these rights from us and Islam will be no exception.  If they want peace (they don't) then they should go back where they came from.  There will be no peace for those who deny our rights within western society.

I hope you understand that intolerance and discrimination are not the reasons a religion is bad.  We don't fight intolerance and discrimination - that isn't what our military is for.  We fight those who deny our constitutional and human rights.  Individual rights are superior to democratic values.  You should do some research on intolerance and discrimination within Islam.  Islam will not tolerate those who are not part of Islam.  Islam will enslave those they deem beneath them.  There is no equality in Islam.  You will be discriminated against and they will be extremely intolerant.</div>

    <div class="md">You very much missed the point of why your view belongs in Iran or Saudi Arabia. Was that on purpose? Try thinking about it again. The way you think about Islam, is how they see Christianity. Do you understand that? Can you grasp that concept, that you have the same views as them, just with swapped names for religions?

I think your view on individualism is an illusion created for you by your government and major corporations so they can use and abuse you as they see fit. They fear crowds, they fear unions, individuals apart are very easy to control and have never succeeded in creating any change at all. Only as leaders of large groups can people together with others create change. And you will never individually protect your own rights. "Taking a gun to the government" as you say will only lead you to a long jail sentence. That is reality.

That you spit on democratic values only further solidifies the case that you should move to Saudi Arabia.

 
It seems you are attributing general basic human behaviour to Islam. All those negative traits, which I agree are very prominent in various Arab countries, are the same also in all other equally poor ignorant cultures in the world. Or is Rwanda a bastion of peace and tolerance to you? 

This is what bigotry is, you attribute all negative parts of humanity to something foreign, because don't like that it applies to you too.

Individual rights are a part of democratic values. They are an idea we've made up, along with freedom of speech and freedom of religion.

Respect the Constitution, and respect democracy. You see clearly how countries are when they don't do this.</div>

    <div class="md">I do not understand why my views belong in Iran or Saudi Arabia.  I don't think they would go over very well there.  The way I think about Islam is not the way they think about Christianity.  That's a stupid assumption and it is incorrect.  Christianity does not violate their individual rights and freedoms.  It is absolutely not the same with swapped names for religions.  You have created a false equivalency likely driven by your emotion toward the issue.  I'm going to continue to repeat that Christianity and Islam are not comparable and are definitely not equivalent.

I know my views on individualism are enshrined in the constitution.  It is very clear on these matters.  There is no room for interpretation. I find it humorous that you believe the individualism is a conspiracy created by corporations.  We have no fear of democratic ideas in a society that values the individual over the group.  Communists value the group over the individual, and capitalists value the individual over the group.  You're preaching communist doctrine and you're pretending that western civilization agrees with you.  The west rejects group think and democracy because it is tyrannical.  The United States uses democracy to select representatives within the republic.  The system is not a democracy, but a republic with a democratic representative.  Change is not a valuable metric, because the point is not to create change.  I may never be successful individually protecting own rights, but I have the right to kill in order to do so.  It will not lead to a long jail sentence if I am in fact protecting my own rights.  The constitution and the courts will protect and individual from the government.  It is possible to kill another human being legally given the right circumstances.  Obviously I wouldn't recommend it.  The point is that an individual can kill to protect individual rights as per the constitution.  This makes it obvous that individual rights are paramount.

I absolutely spit on democratic values.  Please provide one example of a democratic value as I can not think of any to spit on.  I associate democratic values with meaning the will of the majority or group.  I spit on the views that others can tell me what to do or how to live my life regardless of their leaders and large numbers.  I believe Saudi Arabia and the commonwealth/United States equally have no respect for democracy.  We already have a theocratic monarchy in the west, why would I want to move to a theocratic monarchy such as Saudi Arabia? Maybe you should suggest I move to England instead.

I am attributing the teachings of Islam with Islam.  There are many countries that suffer from a lack of moral's and ethics, but they also suffer from a lack of constitutional freedoms, human rights and capitalist opportunities.  There are many reasons we do not want their influence in the west.  Let's keep these morally deprived ideals away from western culture.  The ideals of Islam are not compatible with individual rights or general principles like the rule of law that we hold sacred.  Rwanda now has a large Christian influence which was not prominent until AFTER the genocide of 1994.  I think Rwanda is a bad example for you to use.  More Christianity would be a great thing for Rwanda because they are so morally deprived.  In the west we would not benefit from more Christianity, we already have enough as it is.  The influence of Christianity has done very well for us.  We are wealthy and tolerant.  Muslims can live here and become citizens if they value our individual freedoms and our capitalist values.  That's very tolerant of us considering we are bombing the countries many of them are from.  We understand they do not want their culture and would prefer our culture instead.  We accept those who are willing to assimilate.

I have not attributed anything to Islam.  I am directly referring to the beliefs of Islam.  I do not accept Islam as an idea because I accept individual freedoms as an idea instead.  The two are not compatible.  You need to pick one because there is no middle ground between the two.  We were born as individuals and we will die as individuals.  Individual freedoms are said to be "god-given".  You cannot remove these rights under any circumstances.  Islam wants to remove these rights.  I don't think you understand bigotry, please provide an example of something negative that applies to the west or to myself that I have attribute to something foreign.

"Individual rights are a part of democratic values. They are an idea we've made up, along with freedom of speech and freedom of religion."  You may or may not be correct, but in the west that is irrelevant.  We believe these values are god-given and human beings recognize them implying we did not make them up.  Maybe we did, but we believe we did not.  You're born individual and you die individual.  If you were alone on the earth you would have the rights we have recognized.  We don't believe other humans beings can take away something you are born with.

The constitution is there to protect us from democracy.  They are two opposites; you cannot equally respect both.  In the west we believe that democracy has value unless it infringes on our constitutional rights.  Respect the constitution and use democracy as a tool to select your representatives.  They both serve a very different purpose.  In Islam, you would have neither democracy or a constitution.  

Islam needs to be repelled and removed from our culture.  We create weapons to kill those who attempt to take away our freedoms.  Our ancestors died to give us these freedoms and they did an awful lot of killing.  Your liberal views (I assume - you have no explicitly stated but I assume) are inviting in a culture we will go to war with.  Let's avoid the war by keeping them out.  Understand it is the liberal view that creates a need for war.  If we kept Islamic ideals away from the west then we would let them live in peace.  We don't want them to die, we want them to stay far away from us so we stay at peace.  If they go back where they came from then I wish them no harm.  If they think they can come here and remove my rights then they have something else coming.

Please understand that I am not saying western culture is better than Islamic culture.  I'm saying they are different and incompatible.  You cannot believe in both.  You cannot cherry pick good things from both sides because they fundamentally disagree with each other. I assume you're college educated based on your views and assure you that you have been lied to.  We do not fight intolerance and discrimination, we do not believe that creating change for the sake of change is good, and we do not value group think.  Wanting to "change the world" is a very dangerous and extreme idea that frankly only college kids are stupid enough to believe.  The west doesn't need change - we need isolation from those who wish us harm.

Sorry that was so long, I just hope you can appreciate a constution that prioritizes the individual over the group.

EDIT: Democratic values are subject to change (which is bad) while individual rights are absolute.  God given rights never change.</div>

    <div class="md">I think you're getting confused about the whole individuality aspect. A democracy must protect individual rights at all times, that's a core democratic value, the concept of human rights. Also freedom of speech and freedom of religion and freedom of the press. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That is what you spit on to further your religious bigoted fanaticism. 

But individuals must also band together with other individuals if they want to create change. That's just reality, sorry. 

And if you believe courts will protect you if you murder a government official doing his job... That's just not going to happen.

And then came the deal breaker:

&gt;God given rights

You say that human rights are not an idea constructed by men, but something that God came down to earth to give some guy to put in writing. That makes you exactly the same as an imam or fanatic Muslim.

Thanks for giving me insight into how your mind works. It is much similar to that of an Islamic fanatic, I'm telling you this though I know you will not take that in. The problem with people sabotaging western culture is not Muslims. It's religious and political fanatics which are both Muslim and Christian like you. 

You're the same. We can have a great western culture if this religiousness and disrespect for values of democracy that you and fanatic Muslims share, keeps fading away. 

Also, the U.S. is a democracy as well as a republic. Don't spit on the American flag, show respect to the values that let you have your unpatriotic opinions legally.</div>

    <div class="md">It is NOT the job of a democracy to protect the rights of an individual.  You're simply making that up and it couldn't be more incorrect.  The government does not protect your rights - the courts protect your rights from a government that is constantly violating them.  A democratic value and a right are not the same thing.  A "right" specifically refers to something in the constitution which was created by a non-democratic leader being either god or the founders of the United States.  Human rights are not a value, freedom of speech is not a value, and freedom of religion is not a value.  These are rights.  We don't need democracy to uphold these rights, we have a court system with judges who are appointed to do so.  Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are values, correct.  They are not democratic values because the democracy did not create them.  I am not religious, I don't believe I am a bigot and I am definitely not a fanatic by any means.  I consider this whole conversation to be very simple: **I have the right to free speech and it will not be taken from me at any cost up to and including death.  I'll kill to keep it.**

Individuals must band together to create change.  That's true but who cares? Change is usually bad.  The system we have is pretty good, so changing it would be a bad thing.  If we have perfected it then changing it would mean changing it for the worse.  Most change is bad, and change for the sake of change is horrible. "Creating change" sounds like producing change that wasn't necessary just for the hell of it.  I have no desire to create change.

The courts will protect you from a government official who is violating your rights.  You're missing the point - it is documented in the constitution of the United States that you have the right to rise up against your government if they violate your rights.  The whole point is that individual rights are paramount even if you have to kill to keep them.  Individual rights are totally a thing, while collective democracy doesn't really have rights at all.  I wouldn't fight for an ever changing democracy, I would fight for an absolute right that is recognized by our courts.

I don't care if you believe in god, the term "god-given" is well documented as the reason the United States has a constitution in the first place.  It is un-American to consider "God-given" rights a deal breaker. You can be an atheist and still respect that the country of the United States respects individually liberties that have a higher calling than something a human being could make up.  The easiest way to explain it is this: If you were the only person on earth, you could say what you wanted, own as many guns as you wanted, have any religion you wanted, ect.  Rights apply to an individual even when they are alone.  I say that constitutional rights are recognized as being God-given because that is an undisputable fact.  If you don't agree then you don't agree with the constitution.  As a citizen of the United States you believe these rights are inalienable and granted to us humans by a higher power.  You don't have to believe in god, just that we exist as a result of a higher power (possible evolution) and such powers granted us a body, a brain, a food source, and inalienable rights.  They were given to us when we were born even if only by evolutionary chance.  You can't call "God-given" a deal breaker because it accurately describes the constitution of the United States.  Is the constitution a deal breaker for you too? I certainly hope not.  Stop deciding "what you think is right" and start evaluating facts.  Even if I did believe God delivered the constitution the same way he supposedly delivered the ten commandments that does not make me a Muslim or equivalent.  It might make me equally stupid but the similarities end there.  You obviously know nothing of Imams and Muslims other than you consider them stupid and unreasonable.  If person A wants to kill everyone and person B doesn't really want anything, but both person A and person B believe God hand delivered instructions to humans then are those two people the same? NO.  You have to be one hell of a bigot to say that makes me exactly the same as an imam or Muslim.  Stop generalizing people because its really ignorant and makes your opinion less valuable because you are unable to be specific.

The United States is not a democracy.  These are very simple facts.  Your unwillingness to acknowledge a very simple, obvious and easily researchable fact is disgusting.  You're clearly blinded by your beliefs.  You don't want to know if it is a democracy or not do you? Just GOOGLE IT.  The United States is a constitutional republic with a representative democracy.  So people vote in someone to represent them as part of the republic.  The founders created a republic and openly bashed democracy continually.  Liberals make up words like "direct democracy" and "representative democracy" like those were real things.  A representative democracy is not a democracy.  It is a representative who was democratically elected.  That does not make the government a democracy by any stretch of the imagination.  The term "elected representative" is far more accurate than "representative democracy".

You can continue with the ad-homonyms if you want but they aren't an argument and believing you can compare me to something to make a point is foolishness.

You aren't a patriotic American because:

1.  You believe democratic values or group think is a valuable political tool which is a communist idea.

2.  You're defending the enemy that the United States is spending tax dollars to go to war with.  Let's be clear that Islam is the enemy of the constitution and therefore your enemy as an American.

3.  You consider "god-given rights" a deal breaker.  That's the stupidest thing you've said in this whole discussion.

4.  You don't know or accept obvious facts about western society.  It isn't a democracy.  It really is ALL about the individual rights.  It's the foundation of our society.


You aren't a very good debater because:

1.  You clearly don't know anything about Muslims or Islamists.  You defend them and insult them.

2.  You use bad examples when trying to bash Christianity.

3.  You believe bashing Christianity somehow is helpful to a debate about western values and constitutional rights like free speech.

4.  You make ridiculous assumptions about me then tell me how stupid I am for believing something you simply assumed to be true that obviously isn't.  Maybe you were stupid to make that assumption.

5.  You make too many points with a question mark.  You cannot present an argument by making ridiculous comparisons and asking rhetorical questions.

6.  You avoid points I raise by addressing them with ad-homonyms and bigoted remarks like "all the same".


If you care to continue I won't be responding until tomorrow, I have a lot of work ahead of me to do.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Change is usually bad

A person claiming this must not know much about history. When was america ever perfect? Do you even remember how women, black people and gay people have been treated in the U.S.? Change is the single reason why the U.S. doesn't still share the values of Nigeria.

Rights are still something made up by man, and can be taken away by man at any time. And they are made up from democratic values. In fact, the minute the U.S. stops being a democracy is the same minute our "god given rights" will be gone. But I see you explained now that you understand that it is just a phrase, and you don't in fact believe they were given by God. So then you are aware that they are a democratic values which will disappear if we don't guard against it.

You keep going on about how you don't understand democratic values, here is a short explanation so we can settle that part: http://www.ushistory.org/gov/1d.asp

And the part about you not thinking the U.S. can be a democracy and a republic at the same time: 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/13/is-the-united-states-of-america-a-republic-or-a-democracy/?utm_term=.c8fbccd97a80


I am not saying you are a bigot as an ad-hominem attack, I am stating it as a fact because of how you broadly and negatively you are generalizing a third of the worlds population. I am not comparing you to muslims to in any way denigrate you, I am trying to show you how your thinking is the same as that in Iran. So you can see how similar we all are and ease off your hatred. Just swap the names about and your words could just as easily come from the mouth of an imam. This is not an insult, it is just a statement which is true, that I thought might open your eyes.

I get you have been primed with a fear of the ghost of communism. I despise communism as much as you do, so I don't understand why you're bringing that up all the time.

And I'm not bashing Christianity. Christianity, Judaism and Islam can all be wonderful and they mostly are when practiced in the right way. It's just that they are old medieval constructs which I believe we should move away from. I'm not an atheist though, just not a follower of any religion. I don't "defend and insult muslims". You are focusing on the wrong thing. I am defending the basic western democratic principle of freedom of religion. Which you are attacking, seemingly unaware that in your criticism of muslims you are attacking the American Constitution itself. Which is quite the definition of being un-patriotic.

Thomas Jefferson:

&gt;Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof", thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.[9]</div>

    <div class="md">I absolutely do not remember how women, black people and gay people have been treated in the US.  You don't either.  Most change doesn't work out very well in my opinion, we'll have to agree to disagree on this point.  Rights are not something other people can take away.  Freedom of speech means you can wave your tongue to make noises.  The only way to remove freedom of speech is to remove your tongue.  The rights we have are recognized and not granted.  That's a very important difference.  Rights were not made up from democratic values.  I don't care to discuss the topic of democratic values any longer because you aren't understanding that democracy has no value in the court of law.  An inalienable right by definition cannot be taken away. You need to accept terms like "god-given" and "inalienable" to be an accurate description of rights.  It is fundamental to the western way of life.  The minute the US stops being a democracy our rights will be gone? WRONG.  That wouldn't be true even if the US was a democracy (which it isn't).  We have courts to protect our rights.  By the way, I appreciate the video you sent me about democratic values because I gives me an idea of what you're talking about.  I think the logic is backwards because a free individual is capable of participating in a democracy and not the other way around, but we'll have to agree to disagree.

Dude do NOT trust a damn thing you read in the washington post.  I actually already saw that article.  It's just stupid.  There is no such thing as "representative democracy".  You can't make up words and expect it to prove your point.  A representative democracy is not a democracy.  A better term would be "elected representative".  Democracy literally means "direct democracy".  The word "democracy" never needs to be qualified with words like "direct" or "representative".  If you need to qualify your words then you know you aren't saying something accurate.  I'm not going to play the mental gymnastics needed to read articles from the washington post.  A great debate tip is to never qualify your terms with other terms because it's a great way to lose the debate.

The word bigot is an ad-homonym especially because it has no supporting evidence.  You can’t explain why I’m a bigot, you just have that automatic emotional response.  An assertion of such a thing is mean-spirited and assertions aren’t worth very much in a debate unless accepted by both sides.  I reject your accusations of bigot and believe that you in fact are a bigot based on generalizing very different things as the same thing.  Let’s be clear, I’m NOT talking about a third of the worlds population.  For the last time, I’m talking about Islam which does NOT describe a person or group of people.  Islam is an idea that deserves to be criticized.  You’re the one talking about people and groups of people (like Rwanda, Uganda, Iran, and Saudi Arabia).  There is a huge difference between speaking about a group of people and speaking about an idea.  One is bigoted (you) and one is not.  You’re also comparing me to groups of people which isn’t accurate and certainly doesn’t make any useful points in this discussion.  I would encourage you to show me thinking is the same as that in Iran by actually showing me how it is the same as Iran and not with spineless assertions. You’re wrong, in Iran they consider individual rights to be a foreign concept.  Please name one things I’ve said that is hateful.  Also, define “hate” for me because that’s a mean-spirited word as well.  I don’t hate them.  I want them to live.  If they come here we’re going to have a war so they should go back where they came from and we can live in peace.  Honesty is a type of love.  Which words could come out of the mouth of an Imam if they were swapped? I challenge you to find one sentence or idea I’ve said where that is true.  I think you have a strong emotional response to people who have different world views that you do.

Communism is another liberal principle that causes war.  Liberals are advocating for things that (if successful) will eventually lead to large numbers of death.  It's just a history lesson.  We need to avoid war and obviously avoiding these liberal ideas is the easiest way to do that.  Also the United States killed communists rather recently.  Communism is not a western value.  Communism and Islam are both not compatible with western values.  You’re preaching communist ideas as a western value! It’s important to realize democratic values are communist in origin.  Democratic values are not a good enough reason to censor the free speech of an individual.  Democratic values are un-American although I know we disagree.  I think the takeaway is that I don’t consider democratic values (like equality) to be a valid point within this debate.  I know you think I’m wrong about that so lets agree to disagree.

You absolutely were bashing Christianity.  You think you can compare Christianity to Islam? HA.  You might not consider that an insult but it’s insanely incorrect and offensive.  Islam is not wonderful when practised in the "right" way and in my opinion Judaism isn't either.  I don't think it's fair to say "right way" without acknowledging the doctrine of these religions.  I don't want animal sacrifices, peoples hands cut off, or intergenerational punishment.  I definitely don't want honour killings, a double standard for men and women, and slavery.  Both Judaism and Islam have really awful doctrine.  Islam essentially preaches intolerance to those who are not Islamic.  Muhammed killed people to spread his religion.  He was a tyrant and a warlord.  You can't convince me the worship of a serial killer can be done in the right way.

I agree we could use less religious influence.  I specifically believe a doctrine of hate and intolerance should be abolished.  Freedom of religion isn't superior to freedom of speech.  Freedom of speech will always trump freedom of religion.  The obvious example of this is because freedom of speech comes first and freedom of religion comes fourth.  The constitution can be prioritized by the number of the amendment because that is the order it was amended in.  I'm a big believer in freedom of association and not freedom of religion (which is in-American of me) because I think it is more clear and effective.  Canadians have freedom of association and not freedom of religion and it seems to be far more clear from a legal standpoint.

This is a technicality but there is no basic western democratic principle of freedom of religion.  It is a constitutional right and not a principle.  Freedom of religion fortunately does not protect a religion in it's entirety.  They have the right to their faith and their worship and that's pretty much it.  They don't have the right to associate together in a mosque (they do in Canada, which is a better system).  They don’t have the right to believe the United States should be destroyed while also being protected by the constitution of the United States.  Faith and worship are fine, but Islam is a POLITICAL IDEOLOGY as well as a religion.  Islam is a political theocratic dictatorship that spits on the United States and everything the west stands for.  We’ll agree Islam as a faith and worship will always protected.  Their political ideology is worth killing them over.  It’s preferable to tell them to go back where they came from then to kill them.

TL/DR: democratic values like equality are BAD for a country.  I don't consider the Washington post to be even someone trustworthy or informative.  A bigot refers to groups of people (which I am not).  Democratic values are bad (again) because they're communist and not a part of the United States government.  Don't compare Christianity to Islam.  Freedom is speech is #1 while freedom of religion is #4.  Islam is not protected by the constitution because it is a political ideology.  Saying "Islam" is just a religion is very incorrect.</div>

    <div class="md">This is all very interesting. How you became this way. I don't get it, because it's so alien to reality.

You say: We don't remember how we treated women blacks and gays. As if that excuses how we treated women blacks and gays. And yes I do remember. So let me tell you, it was shit and America has never been perfect. 

Your rights are taken away when you get put in prison for what you say. It can happen under a bad government. This is basic knowledge of how countries work. Look at Turkey or Russia for recent examples.

You say: The U.S. isn't a representative democracy, because you personally do not like the Washington Post. The Washington Post has nothing to do with it, that was just the link explaining it to you. But here, have a very well cited Wikipedia article instead https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy
But that stuff doesn't work on you, your mind will just contort itself into any shape it can go deny even Wikipedia. Not healthy!

And this:
&gt;You can't explain why I'm a bigot.

And

&gt;Please say one thing I've said that's hateful

Later in the very same text:

&gt;Islam is a political theocratic dictatorship that spits on the United States... Their ideology is absolutely worth killing them for.

I'll just... I'll just leave that there. I know you can't see it, but that's the very definition of a hateful bigot (and worse words can also be used.)

Why do you keep talking about communism even after I said I despise it? Are you a closet commie? Do you actually love communism, and that's what makes you keep going on about it even when no one else mentions it? Communism is a sick and ineffective idea, stop thinking about it so much!

Anyway it was interesting seeing how a hateful bigot justifies their unpatriotic (going against the American Constitution) and undemocratic (denying people their faith) opinions. Now I know, and it was very incoherent but strangely resistant to facts. But I have no doubts you mean well inside. I'll leave you with the wise words of Imam Ali, preaching words of islamic ideology you would kill him for

&gt;See the bad within yourself, and see the good within others.

&gt;Free your heart from hate, for hate is a sickness. </div>

    <div class="md">It isn't alien to reality, it's alien to you because you're probably college educated.  You live in a bubble I'd assume.  I'm not excusing anything.  I'm stating the fact that I don't remember. It's ridiculous to assume you can remember something that happened more than a lifetime ago.  You say you remember, but I'm calling your crap.  You don't remember.

You're right that a bad government will take your rights away.  That's what the second amendment is for.  A bad government is not an authority figure.

I'm saying the Washington post is absolutely not a credible source of information.  I'm saying there is no such thing as a representative democracy.  Don't qualify words like democracy because it's mental gymnastics.  General rule of thumb is that if a word needs to be qualified it's because it isn't true.  It isn't a democracy, it's a "Representative democracy".  So democracy? NO. "Representative democracy"? Sure, once I figure out what that means.  It means elected representative.  It doesn't mean that it's a democracy.  Liberals like the washington post for some reason think inventing new terms is legit and it isn't.

That doesn't make me a bigot, it makes me correct! Like I said, we'll have peace if they are not in the west.  In the west their ideology is worth killing them over.  We have to protect ourselves.  If you showed me a point I was being dismissive towards by saying something like "well they're all the same" then I would agree with you about the word bigot.  I'm not being dismissive, I'm stating that we need to eliminate the enemy.  The government and the west in general don't really appreciate differing political ideologies.  We hate islam for the same reason we hate communism.  If you don't like individual rights or the principles the west stands for then we're happy to let you leave (referring to Islamic ideas, not you specifically).

I already answered your question about communism.  You believe a communist idea (democratic values) are a good thing.  They aren't.  Democratic values are a sick and ineffective idea as well.

I'm extremely undemocratic because I support he values of the west.  I haven't gone against the American constitution at all, although frankly I wouldn't care if I did.  A dangerously intolerant and discriminatory political ideology (Islam) has no place here.</div>

    <div class="md">Christianity has had it's day in barbarism. We are finally pulling out of it and into a wonderful world of understanding and advancement, as a whole.

Not to mention, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all roughly the same age. Why is one still teaching people to kill gays, cover their women, and kill in the name of god? Islam and the Middle East as a whole need a little more time to bake before we welcome a religious ethnicity with open arms. </div>

    <div class="md">The difference isn't really between those similar religions. And isn't Islam about 1000 years younger btw?

But anyway, tolerant countries are less religious in general. We can look at Christian countries in Africa to still see great Christian intolerance. So the difference isn't between Islam and Christianity, it's between religious countries and less religious countries. The less religion the better.</div>

    <div class="md">Christianity doesn't preach barbarism. Christian doctrine doesn't include violating another person's rights. You have no idea what you're talking about. They aren't even close to the same age. Islamic teachings include violating human rights. Those teachings will never co-exist with the western world. Time won't solve anything, there has already been more than a thousand years of waiting. We already have religious ethnicity. I think you meant to say religious diversity.</div>

    <div class="md">Judaism teaches fairly extreme xenophobia, for one. Look at what has been happening with Palestine since Jerusalem was given to them. Not saying all, or even most jews are bad people, that'd be ridiculous.

Christianity teaches all kinds of bigotry, and a good number of people make it violent. Homophobia, transphobia, you name it. I've had to deal with a lot of this in my life, and in fact when I was younger and a very staunch believer in "Christ", I used to be an incredibly hateful person, and hurt many people all in the name of "God". I've been hurt by people calling themselves Christians, and seen friends hurt by people calling themselves Christians. Again, not saying all or even most Christians are assholes. Maybe I've just had a bad experience with Christianity, but everywhere I look at Christians and their religion, most of the time all I see is hate and negativity.

Any religion that teaches that you *have* to be a part of a select group of people to be "saved" or whatever, is going to spawn that kind of attitude. The us vs them attitude. Look at Sikhism for example. They don't believe at all that you need to be a Sikh. They don't care what your religion or lack-thereof is, they just believe their religion to be the best path. The same goes for Buddhism. </div>

    <div class="md">I am sorry for your bad experience, however none of thoose are actually Christians. It is strictly against our belief to be disrespectfull and judgemental. I suppose the reason why people like that are the ones who gets known as "Christians" is just because they are the ones shouting. Christianity isnt much different than Sikhism in that regard, apart from our greater wish to spread our belief, and that there is only one way to salvation. We still learn not to force our beliefs however. I hope this cleared some misunderstandings.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah. I mean, assuming Jesus was a real dude and what the bible says about him is true, he was a good guy overall. A bit condescending, sure, (like with the prostitutes) but not a bad person. And Christianity is quite different than Sikhism, because Sikhism believes that people can reach their version of "salvation" in any path we choose to take, they just believe their path is the easiest/best path to take, and they make that clear in the fact that they don't proselytize or have missionaries. Christianity says quite plainly in the bible, that "No one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:6), so it gives them the mindset of "I'm special and these other people are below me". Maybe that's not what Jesus intended, but it's human nature to look down on others for whatever.

I know a lot about Christianity, I've tried pretty much every type of it. I eventually settled in Eastern Orthodoxy, and I even was trying to become a priest and a monk. Somewhere along the way I realized that God doesn't actually love anyone, and probably doesn't exist. It says clearly in the bible that "If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads" (Leviticus 20:13), and seeing as how I am a guy (unfortunately, because I'm also trans), and I like other guys (women too!) then that means I'm "detestable". My own mother has treated me terribly because I'm a terrible gay in her eyes. I can't even be myself around her anymore. We used to have a great relationship, but she's decided that her god is more important than her own child.

By all means, I'm happy that the younger Christians are actually starting to follow their own teachings (even tho there is still that slight condescension towards non-christians), and be more loving, kind, and accepting, just like Jesus would have wanted. Christianity still leaves a bad taste in my mouth whenever I think about it tho. I stopped being a Christian, because what the bible says and what my life was did not mesh. Ever since then, after a period of depression for my entire life's meaning changing, I've been a much happier, kind person, and I actually like myself now. I can't see how it's a good religion by making me feel all the shit that it did. 

Anyway, this has gotten really long, sorry for that.

    <div class="md">Yeah, that's about it really. Abrahamic religions all stem from a source of extreme xenophobia, which naturally fosters an "us vs them" attitude towards the world. Kill them or convert them. Thankfully young Christians are changing for the better. Also hey, we have the same religion I believe haha. Was wondering why your username sounded familiar.</div>

    <div class="md">Why do we continue to connect politics with religion? I would consider myself a liberal, and am quite skeptical of organized religion and government. It baffles me how we have come so incredibly far as humans in science, technology etc, but so many of us are willing to support/believe/worship words written thousands of years ago and are so stubborn that we can't manage to have a discussion or question both the good and bad in those words. I'll admit to being fairly ignorant in terms of religious texts, but I feel pretty confident you could cite hate and love in nearly all of them. </div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Christianity and Judaism is the WHITE MAN'S religion

Then you go to The Russian Caucuses to see some relatives and you notice that the people praying at noon, facing Mecca, appear to be of light skin color with brown eyes, practicing Islamic belief. And then you suddenly realize you had a bias based on the experiences of where you live and what your media is showing you. 

Then for the hell of it you go to Africa for Christmas; you know, to get away. And you find a Christian church in a small town during your travels, so you proceed to go in as churches are supposed to be inviting to all people, supposedly. When you get inside you notice that you and your other happen to be the only white people in the church, and the others are the blackest earthlings you have ever set eyes on. The man wearing the white collar looks over and welcomes you, and asked if you are also Christian. You might replay with "I am not", but the man in the white collar is pleased to see others visiting from far off lands and ask of a story created during your journey.</div>

    <div class="md">Sam Harris likes to use an example for this.

The problem of fundamentalists is the fundamentals.

If your religion is just about hugging puppies I am not going to get worried. But if it used to be about chopping off puppy heads with your teeth, I don't care if you say you don't do that anymore, or that only fundamentalists do it. I'm seeing people do it, and it has to stop, and it won't stop until it's not part of the 'fundamentals'. 

But I haven't seen no one fixin' no holy book to remove the nonsense, the madness, the chaos and the harm. </div>

    <div class="md">While I understand the sentiment, and agree with you that I cannot prove my god exists, please understand this: there are a *whole lot* of people who cannot work through the philosophical arguments as to why they should behave in a certain manner.  A whole lot.  Telling them "God says no, and he can see everything, and there will be punishment," is way easier than helping them work though the mathematical proofs of the prisoners dilemma, or the positive second and third order effects of Hammurabi's code, or the psychological benefits of stoicism and meditation. 

Especially when said people are teenagers with heads full of mush, and bodies full of hormones.

Is it correct?  Is it best?  Maybe not.  Is it better than "nasty, brutish, and short" or "red in tooth and claw?"  Probably.  So I fully appreciate your rejection of religion as a personal choice, and god bless you.  But most of humanity, for most of its existence, is probably better off with having had Christianity, despite the obvious problems it has brought.</div>

    <div class="md">Most of humanity for most of its existence has not had Christianity. Lieing to people about God to scare them like you do with little children with Santa Claus cannot be the best way to help people. I guess you believe the end justifies the means? That a very slippery slope to be on.

 Getting some one to beleive and have faith in something they do not understand, just because they are young ,malleable and easily manipulated is wrong. They are the same techniques used by the leaders of child armies and terrorist groups. 

Also in what specific ways do you beleive society is better off because of Christianity that would not have happened without Christianity?

During the Islamic golden age great works of art and literature were created. New maths were created and others were more fully explained. They were one of the, if not the most, liberal society at the time. 

During the periods of the inquisition and the early dark ages eastern civilization was thriving without any Christianity. Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese, and Russian societies all had civilized, progressive societies that contributed huge amounts of knowledge to humanity in the form's of math, science, art, engineering and literature before Christianity even existed. 

Do you really think your God wants people to just believe in him even if they have no true understanding of Him, just what was fed to them when they were too uninformed and ignorant to question what they were being told was fact? 

If in fact the people in Christianity would more than likely be terrible humans, serial killers, or rapist, or child molesters. And fear of God's wrath is ALL that is stopping them, then yes please keep those church doors open and keep brainwashing them when they are young. 

If you don't beleive the majority of Christians would be inherently awful people if they had been born Muslim in Saudi Arabia or atheist in China and could not come to accept Jesus as their Lord and saviour because of their family, culture, or location. Then I don't understand your arguments. If you do believe this, well fuck,I guess please please continue being a good Christian and I'm sorry if I might have offended you, in case you ever lose faith and start whacking people.

Peace.</div>

    <div class="md">You didn't say x is good. You said most people for the majority of existence have benefited from Christianity. I pointed out many examples of why that is just not true.

I don't beleive good decent people would be anything but good decent people regardless of their religious affiliation. Also I beleive having a religious affiliation as a shitty , terrible person will not make you not a shitty terrible person, I know you know some really shitty people who claim your religion.

I was claiming in my last couple statements of that post that being of any religion is not going to make you better or worse, it's your actions and what you do in the world that make you decent or terrible, not a religion. I should have used less extreme examples. Obviously, Hunan behavior is in a spectrum, my point was that they are a child molesters or a saint or any thing in between regardless of religious affiliation.

You seemed to be advocating for brainwashing children that God is the ultimate Santa Claus, is the best way to stop them from being bad. I think teaching them, reason, logic, science, and free thinking would be much better ways to do the same. Is that harder then manipulating them...yea...but that which is easy is not always the best.

Edit: you didn't say best way it was just the easiest way my bad.

Edit 2: I also apologize for being so condescending in those last few statements and for implying you might be a child molesting, 
Serial killing rapist. That was wrong I take things to far sometimes. Sorry. Also, you have not expressed the belief that Christianity is the only way to salvation and I kinda attacked you like you had. My bad again.</div>

    <div class="md">I actually agree with you that really good people are going to be really good people, and really shitty people will be really shitty people, regardless of which, if any, religion they are influenced by.  It's the people in the middle that can be swayed one way or another.

Similarly, I think secular philosophy is wonderful, and that a lot of Christians are sorely lacking in the "why" department, since so many of them default to "WWJD!!" and stop there. We took the ten commandments out of schools, but didn't replace them with secular philosophy, just participation trophies and self esteem and more recently, social justice.</div>

    <div class="md">I really wish now I had not attacked you :(   You seem like a really chill dude that has actually thought this through. I can respect that.

I can tell you are a progressive Christian and I support and encourage that movement. I do actually agree that someone in the middle of the spectrum can be influenced good or bad by religion, philosophy etc.... So I would like to see them gravitate towards a more progressive church and not be sucked in by some cult or fundamentalist organization when they are at lowest point. 

I have, in my early days of being a atheist, helped someone lose their life. I convinced, using some rather aggressive techniques, a newish Christian that God was a fantasy. I knew this person joined the church and had found hope and a reason to live after spending 10+ years as a junkie on the streets. I took that hope from him and I did nothing to attempt and replace it. I felt at the time like I had succeeded in helping someone see the "truth".

He died of a over dose two weeks later behind a dumpster in a alley. I feel guilt to this day for that. As I have overcome drug addiction myself, I know first-hand it is not easy. I used the rooms of AA which I would consider having a progressive view of God. A power greater than yourself. I used that view for hope at the time. After the fog of addiction had cleared I could no longer maintain that view of God, but non the less I needed that hope at that time. ( I think I just made some arguments that support your view that it is sometimes better to just say Trust God and it will be okay. Then to try and teach someone philosophies or theological arguments.... These do not give the person immediate hope. I and many addicts I know, need that immediate hope when we first walk into a AA room) 

I no longer try to convince anyone to change their beliefs. I mostly now just preach back at people preaching to me that I'm going to hell or if someone try to say Islam is a religion of peace(lol). Or I have discussions about theological ideas with open minded people at the Unitarian Church I sometimes attend or here on the internet since it should be pretty hard to convince someone to leave their belief system in a anonymous forum. 

Thanks for not judging me as I judged you. I think you helped me grow as a person today. I appreciate you taking the time to talk with me and not just attack, even though I did not give you the same respect initially. 

I also think I misunderstood what you were trying to say in your very first post about Christianity being  mostly good thing for most people. That is what you meant I beleive.  But what I read it as, was that Christianity did the most good for the most amount people for the longest period of time. Which I don't think now think you were actually claiming. Nor do I believe you think brainwashing people is a good thing, just that telling them to trust and believe in God can be the best way to quickly stop a lot of people from going down a very bad path. 

Once again thanks for actually being Christ like, and I'm sorry again for my earlier tone and attacks.</div>

    <div class="md">No problem.  I'm a conservative nationalist Catholic cisgender heterosexual white male. I expect to get attacked essentially everywhere I go on Reddit.  But having been raised Protestant, lost my religion, and found it again, I understand and respect atheists as people who genuinely want what's best for everyone, and they think what's best for everyone is the certainty of scientific evidence.  There is more to the human condition than that though, and what religion *does* provide to many is lacking in our culture. 

Usually, having no received wisdom, athiests are more articulate and better prepared to actually discuss things, reconsider their positions, and defend with evidence.  They're great to talk to once they get past my categories and start addressing my arguments.

    <div class="md">Community is the biggest thing I feel atheist in general lose out on. I attend a UU church for that reason. The online atheist forum's I have found myself in consistently attack religion on all sorts of illogical points and look down on someone as stupid or ignorant if they do beleive. They cannot see any good done by religion. They are actually the ones blinded by there own ignorance. I also see quite a few newer atheist using atheism as almost a form of religion, instead of coming to that decision through reasoned thought and a ton of studying and learning. They seem to just reject things they have no real understanding of or the consequences of that rejection if they are wrong. Few leave open the possibility they are wrong which is a similar view most religious folk I meet have. I find my self attacked regularly in the atheist forum here on reddit for defending the Pope mostly. I think he is a pretty great guy and a true man of God that is also a man of the people. Though I guess that could be because of my upbringing too that I feel sentimental in some way toward the Church. I was raised traditional Roman Latin Catholic. I like to think my self open minded and willing to change my point of view and admit when I'm wrong...which is often. I spent years trying to find a religious path to follow and the more I pursued them the more disillusioned I became. In the end I realized it took too much rationalizing to believe in a sky king so I begrudgingly became a atheist by definition. That word held a very negative connotation because of my upbringing. I just have no way to prove that he could exist so I have no choice but to accepted he does not. I was not able to defend faith in the end. I do not know how to have faith in something I cannot come to understand in a factual way. I did however recently discover the idea of a universal cosmic consciousness. I don't have faith in this but it's a interesting thought. Its the idea that existence is the product of consciousness. We think therefore we exist. Thought is the only way to create some thing out of nothing. You can look it up if your interested other people write about the idea better then I can. This could also potentially be testable using quantum computing and the advent of mass data collecting. I would think you would be able to show a interconnectivity of all things on earth and possibly beyond using algorithms and computers if it is there to find. We shall see I think it's a cool idea either way.

Anyways it has been nice talking with you today. Hope you have a great day keep thinking.

Peace.</div>

Same reason liberals won't talk about class (can't go singling anyone out!) when it would be their #1 issue. Same reason liberals seem obsessed with petty identity issues when class is far and away the biggest intersectionality of oppression and intolerance. Same reason the debate has to be "people are people, universal humanism for all!" vs "fuck that! me first! then my state, then my country!" instead of "hey maybe we can be smart about how we interact with foreigners and outside powers."
 
Ideology's a drug. You're taught that the principal is "all humans are equal and rules should be universal" but that's nonsense. The rules aren't universal. The richer you are, the better the rules are for you. The Muslims don't consider "a woman has the right to choose her sexual partners" to be a universal rule, they see that as a refutation of their beliefs. You can't say that, because then you're causing Muslims racists, so that dooms us to a perpetual violent standoff because we can't have a conversation about how to co-exist with these people that actually addresses any issues between us.
 
Conservatives are ideologically blinded too. "The Government can't tell me what to do, I can own a gun!" when obviously the Government controls everything you do, and also logically background checks make sense and are much less invasive than, say, a SWAT raid for smoking weed, or the Government taking your property at a price they say is fair because they need to build a highway through your yard.
 
Simple principles are easy to sell, so that's why the parties sell those simple paradigmatic stances. They don't actually hold up except ideologically. The real value of the liberal cult of non-control and non-interference is that it let people explore things rationally instead of ideologically. That's why you get smart things like separation of powers and democratic popularity-checks. Free markets work because people get to build their business for their profit instead of the State's.
 
But you can't mobilize people to vote on "I have a random collection of policies I consider smart (because this one is efficient, this one will improve quality of life, this will give people more decisions, etc)", so instead, it's "the things that have been successful so far were successful because they had some god-like inherent property."
 
"Real" liberalism, the purposeful distribution of rights not only to government agents but to individuals, designed to reduce tyranny and increase production by rationally distributing powers so that all interests, including private ones, serve the good and things are fair, is gone. Liberalism in the political science sense, little-l now stands for an ideological position that democracy and the constitution are magic. Likewise, now, on the right, free markets are magic, and on the left, universalism is magic (they're axiomatic truths of the universe). Which means you can't be rational when anything requires a little subtlety, intricacy, or a measured approach.</div>

    <div class="md">Well said. This tribal mentality of the left and right is destructive to progress, it's basically WW1 trench warfare. Let's just step back and ask, what the fuck is really going on here? Also combine that with people not being able to admit when they're wrong, or when someone they supported politically is wrong, and nothing ever gets done. People should criticize the people they vote for more than anyone, politicians need to earn votes for their individual qualities and what they bring to the table instead of the (R) or (D). I'm tired of choosing between a Giant Deusche and a Turd Sandwich. </div>

    <div class="md">Most partisans don't think rationally. 

This is less about "supporting Islam" than it is about getting scalps from the opposing team. If I am red and you are blue then we need to diametrically oppose everything and once those positions are staked out, there can be no retreat from either position.

On top of this  people who are the **most** zealous and fanatical partisans tend to also be the most vocal as well as tend to be deeply invested in their partisan communities. So now not only do you have people generally acting without reason, but they are highly visible and loud.

Reddit is kind of the worst for this since moderators tend to be some of the most heavily involved in their communities and if that community is more or less a partisan circlejerk then you know what you're going to see, right...

    <div class="md">&gt; Because it's really not that different from Christianity? And considering [Christinaity]... hasn't progress much

Are you serious? Name a Christian majority country that still sentences people to death based on their sexual orientation or oppresses and limits women's rights? Or supports child marriage laws? Or supports genital mutilation of children all because their religion calls for it? No Western Christian country would tolerate those things. Furthermore, last time I checked, the only religion that's pursued a war in the name of their religion (or Jihad as they call it) in modern times *is* Islam. Yeah, people did horrible things in the name of Christianity, but that was centuries ago and it certainly has evolved. I'm not a fan of religions either, but to claim that Christianity and Islam are the same is simply ignorant. </div>

    <div class="md">It's weird just how pervasive this cognitive dissonance has become.

Over on /r/atheism, they're talking about how facebook and other such sites are banning atheist groups for being critical of Islamic groups that are actively throwing persons suspected of being inadequately theistic off of buildings.

The people who follow the precepts of this movement are not interested in just minorities.  The rest of us appear to be in their crosshairs as well.  It would be hubris for us outsiders to say that one group is correct and the other is not.  Frankly, I don't know why we should care.  

If given the chance, they would oblige us to temporize our worldview as well as how we run our societies with their own worldview.  If we are unable to accommodate that, or find any merit in it, it's inevitable that we will be identified as enemies.  </div>

Always wanna bring it to "liberals and people of color" no it's just common sense that in a community of over a billion people there are going to be some nutjobs. But surely, trying to spread the message that Islam is a violent hateful religion will do the exact opposite of what you want.</div>

    <div class="md">I remember some guy making a comment along the lines of, "Remember when the republican party used to tell Russia to tear down walls instead of sucking their dick." and that comment is just a 14 year old boy trying to get into politics, we've all been there. When I was a 14 year old, I liked to make homophobic comments without substance. However, when I clicked on the profile, it was a mod for /r/worldnews. I'm gonna edit it in if I find it.

On some level these people understand that it's *actually* dangerous to criticize Islam, that it's *not* the same. They will get death threats and they will be credible.

    <div class="md">Atheists here, def not afraid. Americans were raised in the christian culture so we know the loopholes and major arguments that we can pick out when debating religion, the muslim culture has a very expansive hypocritical and arbitrary set of rules in my opinion as well. I still maintain that religion is cause of more deaths than all the major modern conflicts (1700s on) combined. Now that said i have no issues with people who believe in religion but once you go to an extreme of killing in the name of religion, thats murder no way around it </div>

Atheism applies to all religions because atheists don't believe in God. 

My assumption would be American Atheists 'shit on' Christianity more because of familiarity over anything else.

    <div class="md">Almost everyone I know that is giving it a pass (quite a few people) are Democrat-voting Atheists.  Or at least agnostic atheists, or very often atheistic "culturally jewish" people.  

Granted, that also describes most *people* I know, but if you think it's a challenge to find someone who doesn't believe in God but does apologize for Islam, you're not very aware of the current climate.  You're right that's weird and illogical, but so are lots of things we all think and do every day.</div>

    <div class="md">Well sure, but not as it pertains to this conversation.  In fact if you'd contextualized what I'd said it would pretty clearly inform you that I am surrounded by agnostic atheistic liberals who apologize for Islam while I do not apologize for Islam.  I am firmly in the minority on that front when it comes to my social circle.

You, on the other hand, seem to have an image of atheists that you read about in a magazine or a wikipedia definition where they are all superstition-denouncing scientists that spread their rationality equally.  They're not and they don't.</div>

    <div class="md">You're right.  I think you posted this before I added a pretty snarky edit to my post.  I couldn't figure out how to make it sound non-snarky and do stand by the sentiment, so, sorry about the snark.  Stand by the idea that most american atheists (sidenote, idk and i could probaly wiki this pretty easily, but i thought "agnostic atheist" meant 'there is no reason to think god exists but he could--probably doesn't though, deal with it' where "atheist" meant 'there is no god' -- the former far outnumber the latter, but they are not the same thing.  way too long a parenthetical, too tired to edit) give islam a pass that they do not give to christianity, though. 

I think what makes my friends apologize is that they truly want to believe the best of all people, which is part of why I love them.  I've got no clue whether that's the case of all the people like them, but they just really want to/do believe that if we were nicer to everybody they would be nicer to everyone too.  I think their views are oversimplified and often silly, but are A) happier to be around and B) legit more backed by science than the "the way to fix radical islam is to bomb all muslims"/"the way to get rid of the drug epidemic is longer sentences for drug users"/"the way to get kids to behave again is to bring back the belt" type of idiocy I see advocated by a lot of people on the opposite end of the spectrum.</div>

    <div class="md">Don't apologise for snark. I often get people unintentionally offside for my level of snark. I'm a naturally sarcastic and irreverent person. 

So, my atheism is unique in that I used to be a devote Mormon and then dug around a bit and discovered I had been lied to for the majority of my life.  Not only did that shake my belief system, it burnt a lot of faith based and bible based beliefs right out of me. 

Major bug bear is being guided by your feelings to determine if something is true. Talk about the definition of confirmation bias!

So now I'm science and ethics based.  I come to a lot of conclusions that religious friends come to when presented with new information. However, I don't fall into the trap of rationalising certain behaviours with the belief that God will sort it out.  (FFS Trump is not chosen by God to lead America back into the golden age) That can be a boon and a hinderance. Sometimes it would be nice to think there was a cosmic space wizard looking out for me. Evidence simply says that is not the case. 

As for Islam. One stray click will forever shift your view that in the truly fundamental societies, they will forever be at odds with our core values.  I was scrolling through T_D (I like to try and see different perspectives, no matter how obscure or bizarre) and I clicked on a state sanctioned beheading.  I think it's possible to get mild PTSD from watching shit on the internet. 

I'm sure your friends mean well, but they likely lack perspective.  If I were them?  I wouldn't be rushing out to get hardcore perspective anytime soon. Shit'll give you nightmares. </div>

    <div class="md">western athists shit on christianity because christians are, as a religion, a group of spineless pacifists. They are soft targets and  it's essentially a form of bullying. Muslims, on the other hand, feel emboldened to murder anyone who disagrees with their religious dogma and everyone knows it. It's the giant elephant in the room nobody wants to talk about.</div>

Christians are spineless pacifists. 
Muslims are murderous fanatics.

    <div class="md">lol ok, hard core American evangelists are some of the most war hungry people you'll meet, most of them own guns and are just praying for shit to pop off so they can get back 'muh rights' which they've never really lost. There's radical christians in America and abroad just like every other religion, that's not even mentioning the religions in America which meld racism (by whites and blacks) with Christianity. Every holy book from the, Middle East at least, talk about holy wars and fighting and dying for god and any of these people can use that for whatever pretext they want. They love the death penalty and they love forcing their religion on people. If anything they're just a westernized version of radicals in other parts of the world. You've got to remember that these people love to cherry pick verses for whatever situation they're in.</div>

    <div class="md">Well you're pointing out American atheists. What are Americans overwhelmingly surrounded by when it comes to religion? Christianity. Almost all Americans live in or were raised in a decidedly 'Christian' home. You're really ignoring the familiarity most Americans, atheist or not, have with Christianity versus almost nothing with Islam. I can't speak a whole lot on Islam because I've never had to deal personally with it like I have Christianity. I've never read the Quran because I wasn't forced to like I was with the Bible when I was a child. It's not a part of American culture, and I'd rather just not speak about something I really don't know much about, or care to waste my time in learning about. I don't need to spend hours on end poring through the Quran and Islamic texts in order to learn about it to know I don't like it. On principle alone I dislike Islam, especially for what little I do know that is a horrible reflection upon Islam as a whole. </div>

    <div class="md">&gt; but one of those two religions is definitely causing more damage to the world right now.

Both are. Scratch that, most religions cause damage.

 Christian ideologies that plague US politics are regressive. LGBT rights, abortion rights, euthanasia, etc... are all being held back because of Christian beliefs. I know people who can't let their parents find out they are gay because they will get thrown out of the house or beat or worse. The people that are against abortion are 99% of the time 'pro-birth' and not 'pro-life', after the baby is born, they give no fucks about what happens to it. Not to mention all of the cases of child abuse within the Church.

Islam ideologies hold back the middle east from progressing (though it is at a slow rate). People can't be openly gay in some places for fear of imprisonment or worse. Women are controlled in some places. I really don't have to add more since practically everyone knows the worse aspects of Islam in some places.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly bro go to voat.co

Reddit is a sinking ship. The mods and admins are a bunch of democrat cucks who try to silence and criticize everyone. I made a voat account yesterday and I feel so much happy.

Their v/politics is actually partisan and people dont downvote or ban for different opinions and you can say anything without reprocutions, be it threats, racism, etc.

Everything goes overthere. Honestly fuck reddit.</div>

I only took a quick glance but I didn't see anything to suggest the community is any different. Either Reddit's manipulation isn't as extensive as we think or Voat's community is just as shitty as Reddit's.</div>

    <div class="md">Sorry, I missed the suggested website?  Have looked at uncensored news. Not terrible. R/Neutralpolitics is also a nice calm place to visit when you want to break down a complex issue without all the chest beating. 

Edit: went on Voat.co (assuming that's the website you refer to) and it's basically a safe space for T_D. Dissenting views get shouted down. You're not 'allowed' to share sources from what is deemed illegitimate sources. 

Completely biased... a lot like.... r/politics?</div>

    <div class="md">You don't need to like Trump in order to see this website is becoming a bigger hunk of shit every day when it comes to politics. People may disagree with and even hate Trump, but politics is an echo chamber of the highest order. If it isn't 'fuck Trump, Bernie should have won, not my President, Trump is a cockholster, republicans are destroying this country faster than climate change', prepare to be shut down for having a dissenting opinion. Isn't that the heart of politics? That despite differences, people can still find a way to have common ground and still have the same goal in mind? Look at all. It's resist, political revolution, march against Trump, enough Trump spam, and countless others that have done what T_D did. Everyone is so concerned about going tit for tat that the spirit of this website and whatever degree of community you considered it to be is gone. Both sides are filled with nothing but petulant fucking children, but it's even worse with those who lean to the left, because you stand on a platform of 'holier than thou, we don't stoop to your level' and then you do it *even worse* than the ones before you did. And then to top it off, you act like you don't see that there is a pervasive issue going on. Mods and admins intentionally targeting other subs that doesn't align with the opinions of their own. Doxxing people you don't like. Attempting hostile takeovers of subs. For what?! Because you simply disagree with another viewpoint. All of these articles are either about bashing Republicans and taking things about as far out of context as can be possibly done, or praising Dems without any objectivity to display their faults. Yeah, T_D got real fucking annoying during the election cycle, I know. I even contributed to it a little because damn, was it funny to see tons of people get upset over the dumbest trivial shit ever. But instead of letting it die out and run its course, you people made it in to a bigger issue than it ever needed to be. You tried to silence something that didn't need your supervision to begin with, and well, there you have it. A bunch of riled up immature fools, exactly like you. 

For the last 8 years, people have been made to feel like shit for agreeing with right wing politics. You people and this website are the same exact thing as this post brings up, a bunch of immature assholes who can't handle the opinions of others, and the evidence is the front page of all at any given hour of the day. 

So yeah, this website is bullshit, because all anyone actually cares about is validating their own stupid opinions. </div>

    <div class="md">I've got to head to work, but just wanted to acknowledge your wall of text. 

My comment was mostly jest, but we happen to agree on a lot of things. Have never been more involved in global politics since Trump announced he'd be running. 

Anyway, will read and respond in a few hours. 

Edit:  just glanced at the last bit and saw you called me an immature asshole, so can't imagine my response is going to be much more than a 'fuck you.'</div>

    <div class="md">t_D was fucking hilarious during the election. as you mentioned, the shit-posting was somewhat justified because it provoked such a hysterical reaction. even if you hated Trump, you still wanted to be part of the camaraderie simply because the other political subs lacked a sense of humour.  

resist, march against trump and enough trump spam are really nasty subs. they don't have anything to offer except bitterness. the cockholster threads don't get a reaction out of anyone. obviously t_D is just as bad nowadays. anyway, I can't unsub from t_D because I swore an oath before election night:  

if I should fall in battle, my centipedes who fight by my side, gather my airhorn and rare pepes. tell my family how I died. until then I will be strong. I will shit post for all that is real. and if I ever unsubscribe from the_Donald, may the good lord kek strike me dead</div>

    <div class="md">I'm just so relieved T_D has calmed down now that Trump is Prez. 

It's so nice to go there and have meaningful conversation without being called a cuck, libtard, asshole, or somehow have my patriotism come into question because I don't fall to my knees in front of KingDonnie, like the rest of the sub.  I'm glad they have open and free discourse without resorting to brigading dissenting views and banning people.

    <div class="md">By all means, I am happy to have a meaningful discussion.  We'd first have to establish what our mutual understanding of meaningful is. 

For example, have been watching Trump like a hawk and find him to be a bumbling mess up to this point.  I have little faith that he can turn things around, but I have to literally force myself to be objective due to the confirmation bias. 

Happy to parse it down by issues.  Should we start with healthcare?

Edit: also, I love neural politics. When something complex needs parsing, I visit there and get straight forward unbiased information. 

The interesting thing about partisan politics is I'm never going to suddenly swing to the right, just as you won't swing left.  Nor should we be expected to. However, I can be wrong in my view on a specific matter and it's important to recognise this possibility and change my opinion as better information comes to light. </div>

You have valid points on many of your issues. I am more than willing to discuss those issues with you.

    <div class="md">I'd love to see where you interpret my post as a personal attack, because it certainly wasn't, just like you didn't call me a Trumpette. You people is a pretty big blanket statement, because a laaaaarge majority of people here on this website perpetuate the bullshit I'm talking about. I couldn't give a shit who people prefer, if they do or don't like Trump or Sanders or Clinton or an alien from outer space, but if you're going to be critical of one group, be critical of yourselves as well. Otherwise this website will continue to be a hive mind of strictly left wing politics that not everyone agrees with, or has any impartiality to it at all.

    <div class="md">Again, a blanket statement. Not YOU, but you as a conglomerate of people. I have no idea how mature or immature you may be. I'm not even questioning it. But as an organism, the people who are agreeing with left-of-center politics are behaving just as badly as T_D was before the election, before being algorithmed to death, and triggering the entirety of this website. It's become tit for tat. There is no discourse, there is no maturity on a macro scale, it's a 'who can make the other look worse' war, and to me, it's made this website so discouraging to want to stay around for any actual news or any actual discussion. </div>

    <div class="md">Actually agree with that. Though, you keep mentioning how T_D was bad BEFORE the election, which implies it's not a cesspool of angry pitchforks now. 

In other news, James fucking Comey just got sacked on the same day grand jury subpoenas were issued about the Russia investigation. 

Whatever your beliefs, we are in the midst of the most uncertain and frankly alarming crisis in American politics.  

Not really worried about your bad grammar anymore.

And you are right. Some craaaazy shit is going down in this country right now. I don't know how it's going to play out, or what there is yet to be discovered. I didn't like how the FBI did not pursue Clinton further than they did, because by all accounts, she fucked up hardcore, and it sets a dangerous precedent for other government employees and contractors to follow. We should be holding her accountable for what she did, just like anyone else would be held accountable, and rather severely at that. </div>

Not sure how you equate Clinton's email to Flynn acting as a foreign agent, Trump now firing 3 officials directly related to investigating him, and the suspicion of money laundering via real estate purchases. 

If he were innocent, wouldn't he be crying out for a special investigator?

    <div class="md">I don't equate the two. They're very different things, but both very bad. 

I really don't know how to digest all of this since he was in inaugurated. It's highly unusual, and since I've been paying attention to politics, largely unprecedented. I know new Presidents will often replace appointed staff simply because out with the old, in with the new, but with Comey, that should have happened a couple of months ago, not yesterday, particularly when it comes to the top law enforcement agency in the US. But then again, you look at the US Border Patrol, and a lot of the same stuff has been happening with them and no one talks about any of it. 

As far as money laundering goes, I really don't think it's there. He's been under audit for a long time over consistent years. The point of money laundering is to somehow inject bad money in to something, turn it in to good money, and then pay taxes with the bad money, to give the baseline appearance of legitimate business. He may be kind of a dick when it comes to money, but I'd doubt the IRS of all entities would somehow not catch on to it after years of double and triple checking his returns. I'd like to believe in the efficiency of the US government as a whole rather than think every person who's come across his financials ever is a complete idiot. 

As far as his innocence goes, you don't necessarily have to be the first person to cast yourself in to the fire to prove it. To me, that would demonstrate an overzealous approach and in fact be more suspicious rather than staying your hand and your position. It's like the whole 'you have nothing to hide, so of course you can look through everything' deal many people argue for. It's still an expectation to privacy that he, even as President, can reasonably expect to have upheld as much as any individual in this country can expect, even as holding the highest position of power in this county. 

In honestly, I think Americans should be taking a closer and harder look at Congress and at large corporations and holding them more accountable. We only hold them accountable when some really fucked up shit happens, but we don't really as a populace care before then. Why? A lot of politicians don't have Americans best interests at heart, and corporations attempt to exploit any and all loopholes they can to pay as little to no taxes as possible. 

I think what we are seeing now, the grand big picture, is people making a mountain out of a molehill with Trump, in the sense that he's probably a lot more squared away then we are giving him credit for, and seeing a mountain as a molehill when it comes to Congress and corporations. We trying to go for low hanging fruit when we could be going after the more succinctly rewarding fruit for the whole of the American people. </div>

    <div class="md">It's the racism of low expectations.

Oh look we can cherry pick some quotes that show Islam has nice things to say. 

**NO FUCKING SHIT**. Do you expect the  *entire* Koran to be filled with angry Jihad? It's a religion, of course some parts of it are nice. Those aren't the "problematic" parts, to use a popular SJW term.

The "problematic" parts are, you know, the parts where it tells Muslims to kill Jews and infidels, stone women, kill apostates, and take over societies and treat non-Muslims like second class citizens. 

But to a liberal Islam gets a gold star for not being 100% evil all the time. Yet Christianity is literally the worst thing the world has ever seen. Never mind the fact that the very concept of civil rights and equal rights was born and incubated in "christian" societies.</div>

    <div class="md">The problem is that organised religion exists at such a large saturation point in this country. The Bible is just as bad as the Koran, but we can't point that out without pissing off a huge percent of the country. 

In the context of that framework – i.e., tolerating the national acceptance of one Abrahamic religion that provides a framework for dehumanisation – the only response is to work and create social acceptance for another Abrahamic religion that has equally dehumanising doctrines. 

It's also important to remember, of course, that the majority of Muslims are not any worse than the majority of Christians. At worse, they're just silently judgmental of "Sinners" like your stereotypical prudish Christian is. "Islamic terrorism" is a response to American and British adventurism in the Middle East as a result of the cold war. Islam itself isn't the cause of the terrorism, it's just a vehicle used to radicalise desperate young men living in countries where the quality of life is shit from military conflicts decades before. </div>

    <div class="md">I don't agree that on a global basis (not just the USA) the majority of Muslims are not any worse than the majority of Christians in terms of certain retrograde beliefs. [This research from Pew](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/) is a comprehensive country by country breakdown of what Muslims believe. A couple of things that struck me about the data is how "radical" Egypt is compared to a lot of other places. In general the data in this report suggests that Muslims appear to believe in a soft touch when dealing with non Muslims but police themselves in extremely harsh ways. So, for example, in Egypt 74% of Muslims believe that Sharia should be the law of the land, and of those people, 81% believe in stoning as a punishment for adultery and 86% believe in the death penalty for apostates. But at the same time, only 29% of Muslims in Egypt believe that suicide bombing is sometimes/often justified (still a shockingly high number). There are significant differences from country to country with the Muslim nations of SE Europe being the most moderate--which is not too surprising. I don't believe that any Christian nation today would hold similar views. Finally, I don't believe that the data shows that Islamic terrorists are mostly desperate young men from shitty countries. The 9/11 terrorists, for example, were mostly very well off, many from positions of privilege, and were highly educated. Some had PhD's. But I do agree that these Islamic terrorists, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds, are motivated by American adventurism in the Middle East. I believe Osama bin Laden stated this many times. </div>

    <div class="md">Directed hate instead of tolerance or at least an attempt to "save" makes the harm done from Islam above that of more neutral organized religions. 

&gt;The problem is that organised religion exists at such a large saturation point in this country. The Bible is just as bad as the Koran, but we can't point that out without pissing off a huge percent of the country. [...]

In every other aspect you have a point. (Not trying to debate details or make other faiths appear innocent in comparison)

I felt in addition to your comment it should be noted deliberate focus on directed conflict rather than conversion, isolation, or coexistence (as a global theme) makes this faith particularly incompatible and incapable of co-inhabiting alongside modern freedoms and culture. 

There are always exceptions but we are not talking examples but rather scripture that is treated as authoritative and therefore harmful. 

^(*Disclaimer: I don't believe the above absolutely as it might sound but am playing devil's advocate / attempting to add to healthy conv*) </div>

    <div class="md">&gt; The Bible is just as bad as the Koran, but we can't point that out without pissing off a huge percent of the country. 

Yeah, no. Let's be perfectly clear here. The bible is not as bad as the Koran/Qoran . While lots of shitty things have been done in the name of christianity, christianity was just the excuse, not the cause.  No where inthe bible does it say "lol go out and kill people, lol go conquer lands in my name, LOL CONVERT SAVAGES ;)" Those are things people did all on their own in order to increase their own wealth and power.

The new testament is the doctrine christians follow, and it's non-stop pacifistic 'be a good person, help the poor' hippy bullshit. The problem with christianity is that, over the past 2000 years, it has splintered into thousands of different groups who have chosen to use it as a banner to rally under and project their own desires onto others. 

No where in the new testament does it say "go out and kill people for having opposing views, its okay to fuck children, beating women is awesome" like the Quran does. Yeah, there's a lot of stupid backward savage shit in the OLD testament, but christians do not believe in the old testament. Your ass hole preacher might reference it to fill in air time while waiting for an excuse to ask for donations, but it's suppose to just be there in the bible as a reference to demonstrate how badly the hebrews fucked up and disappointed their god.

But islam and the quran is different. You can't be a good muslim by minding your own business and simply following the dietary restrictions and prayer requirements. While the majority of muslims may not personally ram a truck into infidels,  they also don't do anything to try and stop a more radical mulsims from doing so because they damn well know what happens to apostates and heretics in the context of islam.

The real problem with islam is that it isn't a religion. It is a political system disguised as a religion. In the bible, jesus tells people all this bullshit about how they should be nice so things will be chill in heaven when they die, nearly everything that is written is about how you  are suppose to go out and earn the right to live in some heavenly paradise, it's all spiritual mumbo jumbo. But the point is, the end game goal of pure christianity is to be a good person and you will be rewarded in ANOTHER WORLD. But the Quran is the exact opposite. It has laws and regulations and suggestions and demands its followers go out and fuck shit up in the real world. That's the exact opposite of spiritualism. Islam gives its followers real goals that have real consequences and it seeks to perpetuate itself not through faith or spiritualism but through violence and coercion. I can't think of any other religion that does that.                 </div>

    <div class="md">It really is just about the interpretation. Both books taken literally are truly awful. Both books more progressively interpreted are not so bad. Problem is both books can and have been used for justifying an amazing amount of violence. 

Do you believe that during the inquisition that Christians did not beleive their holy text was in agreement with them? 

Do you think the West Borough Baptist Church believes they are doing God's work based on their interpretation of the Bible? 

Christians had the reformation.....It reformed their beliefs to be closer to what you  describe as modern Christian beliefs. Fundamentalist Christians and Atheist usually see the Bible literally. In this sense it would be as bad as the Quaran. 

Here are just a few examples of red letter new Testament Jesus referencing, teaching from, and protecting the old Testament.

The Scripture cannot be broken’ (John 10:35). 

He referred to Scripture as ‘the commandment of God’ (Matthew 15:3) 

and as the ‘Word of God’ (Mark 7:13). 
He also indicated that it was indestructible: ‘Until Heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law, until all is accomplished’ (Matthew 5:18).

When dealing with the people of his day, whether it was with the disciples or religious rulers, Jesus constantly referred to the Old Testament: 

‘Have you not read that which was spoken to you by God?’ (Matthew 22:31);

 ‘Yea; and have you never read, “Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babes thou has prepared praise for thyself”?’ (Matthew 21:16, citing Psalm 8:2)

and ‘Have you not read what David did?’ (Matthew 12:3). 

The bible, if taken literally, seems to imply rather strongly that the old Testament is indeed valid.

Here is a link written by a pastor about different modern ways Christians interprete the Bible. 

http://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogerwolsey/2014/01/16-ways-progressive-christians-interpret-the-bible/

Also it seems you think Islam is a single entity. There are various schools of thought and interpretations of the Quaran. There are various different sects and groups of Islam. Hopefully a progressive movement inside Islam happens and they can have there reformation as well.

Peace.

I believe that there is an interpretation that says Jesus was the one who fulfilled the scriptures. I think there's a few passages describing this, I don't have time to go looking for it now though. </div>

    <div class="md">&gt;different sects and groups of Islam

Of which every single faction professes that the Quran is the final word of God. So the scriptures inside it are basically holy and inviolable. As a personal anecdote, I had extremely vehement arguments with friends about the Charlie Hebdo shootings. Friends, mind you, that were pretty much liberal in every way than the average Muslim, would argue the shootings were justified because they insulted the Prophet and therefore were asking for it.</div>

    <div class="md">So do any Christian sects not believe the Bible is the final word of God? Serious , I don't know of any. It just comes down to what lens you view the text from. Also I was only arguing that the books are equally disturbing not the religions. Most Christians today do not follow the Bible literally and look for its meaning instead. There are some sects of Islam that also look for the meaning instead of the purely a literal translation. They are in no way the majority unfortunately. Mainstream Islam is much more a threat to the civilized world today than Christianity, mostly because Christianity has been reformed, Islam has not.</div>

    <div class="md">Didn't really want to jump in on this but damn you made a massive error. The US is pretty much the only Christian majority first world country. A lot of the third world countries in Latin and southern America are extremely catholic and yeah there's drug violence there but you don't see Catholics running people down in trucks because they are a different religion there. Those countries are probably more comparable to Middle East in socioeconomic standards than the first world countries and religious majority wise. To say Catholicism has a history of causing violence is true but that's the key point. Other than the few extremist places like Philippines and some African countries that persecute gays in the name of Christianity, which the church doesn't back, there's not much violence presently. You can not say that is the case with Islam presently and compare it to what another religion did centuries ago. The world has progressed since those times but Islam has not.</div>

    <div class="md">That last part of your post has got to be, bar none, some of the dumbest shit I have ever read. Civil and human rights existed thousands of years before Christianity developed. Just in the West alone you famously have the Greeks and pre-Christian Romans striving to define the basic terms of what constitutes citizenship and how members of a given society.  Much of modern Western civics is rooted firmly in the secular, humanist revolutions that took place in the late 1700s to early 1900s. And that's just the west. Every society defines civil rights, every society defines human rights. Christianity is not exceptional in any way.

Try to contain your incredulity if you don't mind. You know as well as I do that in pre-Christian societies like Greece and Rome, *slavery* was common practice. You had the philosophical reasoning behind civil rights, sure, and you had people opposed to slavery in principle, but it was still legally practiced. I am talking about equal rights in post abolition societies, and the first ones were pretty much Christian countries (or secular if you like, since the US technically is secular) and even spearheaded by prominent Christians (like Martin Luther King Jr.).

And no I am not a Christian myself, I am an atheist and well aware of the really bad shit Christianity has done. </div>

    <div class="md">MLK himself credited Gandhi as "the guiding light" of his movement. Certainly Christianity played a role in who MLK was but the root of the movement is a universal desire for equality. And again, the framework for what we consider inalienable human rights spring from revolutionary periods between the late 1700s and the early 1900s, nearly all of which were fairly hostile to religion. 

If slavery is a benchmark for you the Qing liberated all slaves and peons well before the West. The US, a majority Christian nation by all accounts, maintained their own slave trade far longer than the majority of Western nations. Arguably slavery in the US still exists, either through debt peonage or compulsory labor from inmates. There is no such thing as moral exceptionalism, only percieved moral exceptionalism. </div>

    <div class="md">That's all well and good about Gandhi, and I am not disagreeing with you about the man himself. But in *India* where Gandhi not only protested against the British but also the caste system, Gandhi was not successful in abolishing the caste system from Indian society.

I feel like you are being intentionally contrarian. Can you really point out a society to me that was not a western, predominantly Christian society, in which not just **one** of the following were true, but all of them?

- Equal rights for men and women

- Equal rights for all races and ethnicities and skin colors etc.

- Abolition of slave ownership

- No state sponsored religion

In fact it is probably because of the factioning of the Christian religion that equality became a core value of Christian nations . . . it started with the recognition of a need to tolerate other sects of Christianity. (this is just stream of consciousness now, I have nothing to back this up)</div>

    <div class="md">What the hell? It sounded so smart until

&gt; The very concept of civil rights and equal rights was born and incubated in "christian" societies.

Parts of christianity literally oppose rational thought, science, and equality. Then the part about "equal rights was born", like no culture except the crhistians had ever tried equality before (though in reality many had tried and succeeded for a time).

Just so very insane.</div>

    <div class="md">Hey, there are 'problematic' parts of the Bible, it says to stone gays to death, says it's okay to have slaves (and beat them!) including children as sex slaves. 

Or this little gem of genocide:

"This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroya all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ” 1 Samuel 15

Not to mention the many instances of Christian terrorism that get conveniently ignored...

But I don't exactly judge them as a group for that, do i?</div>

    <div class="md">I don't think anyone who doesn't like evangelical Christianity promotes Islam. Most of the people in this situation just haven't had to live around islamists who want to push their religion onto people while they have lived around Christians who do. Most (albeit their are also a lot of atheists who are anti Islam) of the vocal islamaphobes are the same people who would want to shove Christianity down your throat. It's an obvious enemy of my enemy type thing, the ones who vouch some of the more lurid actions of Muslims are just plain idiots and outliers.</div>

Christian zealots are bad, but so are Muslim zealots. There's not a lot of disagreement there. Don't conflate hatred of violent, aggressive members of one faith for peaceful members of another just because the second also has intolerant members.</div>

    <div class="md">I have no idea how anyone can attack any religion if they are part of a religion. The people that do really need to see if those same criticisms can be applied to their own belief system.

At least Christians have admitted, for the most part, that their is some fucked up shit in their bible and terrible violent acts perpetrated in the name of Christianity in the PAST before the reformation. All Christians ,that I know for example, think bombing abortion clinics and protesting funerals with hateful signs is appalling and they speak against it. 

If Christians want to speak out against violence in another religion that is perfectly fine because they speak out against violence in their own religion. I oppose, the my religion is right yours is wrong because...blah arguments. Those kinds of arguments can usually be used by any religion claiming superiority over another.

Islam has not gone through a reformation to bring that system of religion up to par with the expectations of the modern, equitable, progressive, global society we all live in. They are still trying to force a ancient rule of law written by a wise man trying to help the people of his time be better.

 I don't believe Mohammed ever intended his writings to be a form of oppressive government 1000s of years later without any changes to it. Though I could be wrong he might have actually intended that and he might have actually believed he was talking with God's angels...maybe he was tripping balls on some psychedelic plant....or maybe he, and most writers of ancient prophetic text, used the God said it path since it's easier to convince people to follow God then to follow man. 

In both the Bible and Quaran some very practical advice is given such as not eating pork. When cooked incorrectly pork can be deadly. After you see this happen a few times as the leader of these people, you figure the best way to keep them from dieing eating bad pork is to say God says no pork.

At the time the Quaran was written it helped a lot in creating a very liberal progressive society......at that time in history. Today it is just backwards, racist, misogynist, violent nonsense that should not be considered at all when creating a modern system of government for modern people.

I do sometimes attack Christian beliefs I find outrageous, but I do not equate the Christian religion to Islam. They are not equally bad. 

I will argue both the Bible and Quaran, taken literally, are both equally horrible. What Christians today get right is that they look at the Bible through a filter of love. This allows you to disregard the awful parts and focus on the liberal message of Christ. This does not happen nearly often enough in Islam. They often view it literally or through a lens of having outside oppressors or a need for jihad.  

I more often criticize Islam then Christianity because of this. 

Hell the new Pope even said " who am I to judge who gets into God's heaven. I don't presume to know the mind of God". No high ranking members of Islam are pushing a message of acceptance and peace like that. 

TLDR : Evangelicals can be criticized for quite a few things but overall the Christian religion is trending in a modern, progressive way and has been since the reformation. They also, for the most part, do not want biblical law to be the law of the land. 

Islam is stagnant. It is used as a guide for a authoritarian government that controls a large amount of the worlds population. Jihad and martyrdom, child marriage, female circumcision, stoning people, male superiority, to name a few, are still prevalent ideas in Islam that need to be criticized.

How anyone can be against Christianity and for Islam is baffling to me. 

Peace.</div>

    <div class="md">they don't like censorship

they dislike disapproval of specific religions

religion is weird. it's stupid, it's bullshit, it doesnt hold up to critical analysis, and anyone who takes the time to look at any religion can figure out in a few minutes that none of its legit, but youre not allowed to point that out unless the religion is dead or wasnt really that sincere to begin with (like greek gods). 

everybody knows christianity is bullshit. everybody knows horus, the egyptian god, is the exact same person as jesus, the christian god. everybody knows horus was made up earlier, everybody knows jesus is a ripoff, everybody knows christianity is a mashup of a bunch of other religions to appeal to the widest audience of stupid sheep farmers possible, everybody knows that dedicating your life to a book that proclaims god got so pissed one time when some kids made fun of a bald guy that he sent bears to kill them is completely fucking insane, but youre not allowed to talk about how obvious it is that its all bullshit garbage and that people who listen to it are insane. 

the idea is doubly strong when it comes to muslims because muslims are just so prosecuted ever since 9/11 and we need to respect them and their wacky dumbass backwards religion that promotes raping people and killing people until they agree with you</div>

    <div class="md">This is one of the most baffling things about the current climate today.   
The typical liberal progressive has a very negative view of Christianity. They hate all of the intrusion, the push to have religious monuments on state grounds, the anti-abortion stuff, the push to censor art and music.     
These are all reasons they cite frequently.    
Now though, there is almost a rush to bring Islam into the states as quickly as possible even though they bring their own religious baggage and expectations for other people to change to suit them. You can;t even question anything about it without the spectre of racism being trotted out.   
   
There have been plenty of examples already of immigrants in areas trying to change the surrounding culture to suit their views and they have shown in many cases to be very resistant to integration.   
Can anyone explain the logical consistency gap here? </div>

You talk about dicks. How many comments have you seen by "left wing" posters that are hostile to anyone even slightly conservative.    
You say "lol" but is isn't very funny to me.</div>

    <div class="md">a) just give me one example of being banned from a sub while you were being polite 

b) yeah sure when a sub is an echo chamber, the group that is in the plurality will be 'allowed' to be dicks, see: the_d, not saying that's great but that's how it is 

C) lighten up, it's Reddit you shouldn't be so upset about Reddit </div>

    <div class="md">Not that I have anything to prove to you, and anyone reading this who has experienced the same knows exactly what I am talking about, but like I said if I get the time and motivation later I will do just that.       
You say lighten up but what we are talking about is happening in real life. It isn't some imaginary event. There are real consequences to what we are talking about. How much has science and the arts been impacted by CHristianity. Stem cell research for example. Where might we be now if we hadn't been trying to appease a group for religious reasons.    
Now we want to encourage another group to do the same?     
So I am curious if you actually have an answer to my original question.    
Why do liberal progressives actively fight Christianity while trying to uplift another group that will do the same things?</div>

And no one is trying to "uplift" muslims, they're trying to help out refugees from wartorn countries that happen to be Muslim. No one is trying to replace the majority religion in America with Islam or implement sharia law besides the most extreme of extremist extremist people. </div>

/u/Agastopia, one of Reddit's top regressive authoritarians, pretending that r/politics wouldn't simply ban you for asking these sorts of questions (don't bother trying to pretend they don't, either, there has been copious proof posted in other subs about your little regressive authoritarian cesspools).

    <div class="md">Conservatives in the West critique Islam, while defending Christianity. Do you think that the Muslim world cares about critiques coming from the West?

Conservatives in the Muslim world critique Christianity, while defending Islam. Do you think that the West cares about critiques coming from the Muslim world?

Liberals in both places critique their own societies. Those societies are the only ones that they have the power to change. Liberals in the West cannot change policy in Saudi Arabia, any more than liberals in Saudi Arabia could change policy in the West.

I support giving power to Muslims in the West because they are the most likely to have their civil liberties stripped, to be subjected to indefinite detention without charge, and to be assassinated abroad without due process. 

I support giving Christians power in the Muslim world because they are the most likely to be killed for their religion, jailed for blasphemy, or be treated as second class citizens. But no one in the Muslim world will listen to me, a Westerner. So I concentrate on those who will listen to me.</div>

    <div class="md">They're an oppressed underground minority. If they do exist then they're doing it in secret, they would almost certainly be killed if it was known what they think. 

My point was more that liberal progressivism in any recognizable form does not exist as a political manifestation in Muslim countries. The social progress is largely stuck on debating punishments for apostasy, and whether women have rights. </div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Do you think that liberal progressives in Islamic countries have the same negative view of Islam?

No, because they kill you if you do.    If there are any liberals anywhere close to western liberals they stay in hiding or are thrown off buildings or beheaded.</div>

    <div class="md">I think one largely held trait of modern liberals is that they root for the underdog out of blind compassion, despite the  contradictions or context involved. CEOs vs. the working class, Christians vs. atheists or Muslims, heterosexual vs. LGBT, strong families vs. independent individuals. It seems to be more about sympathizing with the underdog than any other major factor. For instance, what if the religion you are sympathizing with has low scores (arguably the lowest, even lower than the big heads on Fox News) on women's rights issues? Imagine if a bunch of rich white Christians wanted to start a new branch of Christianity where the woman needs to be covered from head to toe in a garb so that she won't be seen by other men? And where the man is the ultimate authority and the woman has very little decision making capacity. Liberals would be marching in the streets to keep that out of our country.

Hence, it doesn't seem like policy even matters that much because there are several glaring contradictions between many of these things. They even hold people to different standards - if it is a poor person that commits a crime, it is chalked up to the nurture or desperation argument, but if it is a rich person, that person must simply be an evil greedy bastard with no other explanation necessary .... I say this as a liberal-moderate by the way.</div>

    <div class="md">I consider myself a liberal but don't feel this way. I don't support Islam because they aren't willing to assimilate like the rest of religions in the world. Their aim is jihad. 

What you're referring to is what I and others call leftism. It's hypocritical and contradictory of what these "liberals" supposedly advocate. 

I wish I felt safe opening our borders up to refugees, but the fact of matter is that I have Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, and other religious and non-religious brothers to safeguard. I wish the party who is supposed to stand for liberalism and progression saw this. </div>

    <div class="md">It's just not that simple, though. 

You'd probably call me a typical liberal.  Though I oppose Islam (and other religions) on a personal level and in the government, I do not oppose someone else's choice to follow their religion. I am determined not to discriminate against someones personal beliefs. </div>

    <div class="md">Why not discriminate against someones personal beliefs? 

I'd absolutely discriminate against someone who is a self-professed white supremacist or a Neo-Nazi. I'll do the same to people who willingly believe in, support, and normalize the poison that is mainstream Islam.

Sounds harsh. Especially when you consider that lots of Muslims were raised with Islam. But so were a lot of white supremacists and Neo-nazis with their beliefs. There's some personal responsibility to ditch your shitty personal beliefs once you reach the age of majority and/or become an independent adult. 

For that reason, I am fine with saying that I routinely judge and discriminate against every adult Muslim I see.</div>

    <div class="md">I think "discriminate against" gives the wrong impression. In both of these cases.  It's more of a prejudice. Like:  "You really bought into this nonsense? How much of this do you believe? What are the chances that you hate me and want to hurt me because I don't believe in your religion? If there's no chance, why? The **literal word of your god** says that you should... among other equally nasty things".

This is diminished with Christians, because they had a reformation and decided that the bulk of the nasty things in the OG bible were not appropriate. And it also helps that the Bible is a compilation of different authors writings, and not the direct statements of god through Muhammad/Jesus, as it is in Islam.

I could believe that a Christian would be "moderate", and choose to listen to only the parts of the Bible that he/she thinks are appropriate... But when the Quran is accepted to be the **revelations of god** through the prophet himself, it becomes hard or impossible to lose the responsibility of following the god's word exactly.

But yes. For what it's worth, I would discriminate against a Christian. But not as severely as a Muslim. Christianity sorted out its major issues and revised the text hundreds of years ago. Islam hasn't, even relentlessly denies the need for a reformation, and a significant part of the population is just fine with that.

Both by the text and in practice, the principles of Islam in 2017 that stand for violence, intolerance, hate, sexism, and all the rest far outweighs any of those that principles that are also found in Christianity today.</div>

    <div class="md">The neo nazis you see largely follow the same religious texts as good christian people who aren't racist. The KKK was christian. They burned people on crosses. Now it's not fair to say that "Christianity is a cancer to America that promotes the spread of racism and murder" because not all Christians believe the same things as the KKK.

Islam is no different. There are extremists who do violent terrible things and there are peaceful people who only worship and follow their religion nonviolently. When you say that you "discriminate" against islam, you are attacking violent and peaceful people alike.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;There are extremists who do violent terrible things

i live in Egypt, and tbh i'm not afraid of being killed in a terrorist attack, the problem with islam isn't jihad or terrorism, it's extremely conservative social views, i want to live in a society where premarital sex,homosexuality,atheism,interfaith marriages, secularism,blasphemy and plenty of others are normalized, today they are all taboos, things you can only do or believe in secret. this won't change without challenging Islamic doctrine. and trust me we are far away from seeing any change towards any of those things. secularism and liberalism are pretty non-existent in Muslim world, and western intellectuals by large instead of working on advocating liberalism within Muslim circles they are normalizing Muslim conservatism.

i know that me and any other atheists or liberals can just leave to any western or secular country out there and leave yard for conservatives, but it just hurts my eyes seeing Islamic conservatism being imported in the west without any challenging as well. i don't want to leave Cairo to find another Cairo in London or Germany, don't get me wrong, Muslim conservatives should be free to practice their religion without discrimination, but at least they should get the same scrutiny that other religious conservatives are getting as well</div>

    <div class="md">It's such a shame fundamentalist Islam is staging a takeover at all levels of the US government 

Oh wait no, that's Christians. Organized fundamentalist Islam is just seeking to spread terror. 

Oh wait no, that's bad too. It's almost like both Christianity and Islam are bad for humanity in their own different ways. I should have just said that in the first place, excuse me. </div>

    <div class="md">If by "free shit" you mean required healthcare, you're right. Not doing everything we can for people who can't help themselves is reprehensible and in a nation as prosperous as this it is tantamount to genocide. There is a class war going on and the poor are losing, and it's largely the Christian idea that you get what you deserve that's causing it. 

You don't always get what you deserve. Life is random and bad things happen to good people. Not acknowledging that and not working as a society to provide for those that need help causes just as much undue human suffering as bombings and truck attacks.

And it's systematized. </div>

    <div class="md">Where is your compassion, man? I spend my own money. I buy lunch for people who need it, I've paid rent for people, and I only make $15 an hour. I have a tremendous amount of respect for wealthy people that give more than they take. 

Unfortunately, that's not most wealthy people. I just want a government that cares about and cares for its citizens, so fuck me, right? If there were less people with your "I got mine, so fuck you" attitude we'd *all* be more prosperous. 

What the hell is the point of civilization if we're not trying to raise all ships? What good is progress if our collective suffering isn't reduced? 

You're cold hearted. </div>

And again that was ~150 years ago and didn't have anything to do with religion.  Your best argument is examples that happened hundreds of years ago or not at all? </div>

    <div class="md">So what you're saying is that Muslims of today are as civilized as Christians 1000 years ago? I guess I could agree with that.

Oh and let's not forget that the crusades were a response to Islamic aggression in Europe. 

Try again kiddo.   </div>

    <div class="md">Just like the events happening in the middle east today are a response to WWI era politics and causalities.

As for how "civilized" they are.. well, the religion is roughly as old now as Christianity was during the Crusades. So i'd say they're right on target!</div>

    <div class="md">Is death for apostasy extremism? Is death for homosexuality? Is stoning to death for being raped? Is treating women like subservients?

Maybe you picture that nice family of doctors down the road when you think of Islam. But I'm sorry to tell you but they are not representative of how the religion is practiced in the majority of the world. Like Christianity, Islam needs a renaissance. The cultural practices within Islamic nations are regressive and counter to the values western society has fought for for centuries. This insistence to put blinders on in the name of tolerance is unhealthy. You're not helping anyone by denying the violent and oppressive practices done in the name of Islam. What stopped the violent and oppressive practices of Christianity was people speaking out against it. If you aren't willing to have a conversation about it, how is anything going to get better?</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;But I'm sorry to tell you but they are not representative of how the religion is practiced in the majority of the world.

I disagree. The vast majority of practitioners aren't violent maniacs bent on killing everyone else. Most just want to live their lives and keep to themselves.

That being said, I'm not defending the violent aspects of Islam. Perhaps they were useful values when they were created, but they're hardly of use now.

Yes, Islamic nations will need to have a cultural renaissance if it wants to assimilate into Western society. However, I don't think they're obligated to do so, at least for those who are not living within Western countries. We're the ones forcefully interesting our own beliefs onto their territories.

&gt;This insistence to put blinders on in the name of tolerance is unhealthy.

I'm just as tolerant of Islam as I am of Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, or any of the many other religions practiced around the world. I'm tolerant of the people who practice it, because they're people, and not mindless things. I think ignoring the fact that there are actual people who have their own sensibilities and culture is unhealthy. If I'm putting on blinders because I'm thinking about the people, then so be it.

    <div class="md">Hi, My name is Brian and I'm a liberal who opposes religion in general terms.  I grew up in a Lutheran household in suburban Detroit.  Lots of Muslims here, they make some fantastic food but sometimes are backward as fuck.  Extreme right wing ideology thinks I don't exist, and yet here I am...wishing all religious idiots would stop effing up politics and world affairs.  Don't act like Christianity is better, it's not.  I'm sure we could find some African gays sentenced to death who could attest to that, if only they could still speak from beyond the grave.  I AMA.</div>

    <div class="md">You ever had a proper Shish Kofta son???  With some Pilaf, and Tabouli...some Hummous with fresh baked pita?

Seriously though.  Regular liberals are very similar to regular conservatives...both sides have allowed the extreme factions to speak for them, and both sides are to blame for the shambling catastrophe that is American politics.</div>

    <div class="md">I can't speak for all liberals, but I'd like to share my viewpoint.  

I'd like to see practitioners of Islam treated the same as Christians.  Both holy books say to kill lots of people for silly reasons, and the majority of practitioners ignore those parts of the book.  When I see a good person being treated poorly only because they're Islamic, it makes me sad because there's no reason for it.  So when I tell you to be nice to Muslims, I'd just like you to treat them the same as Christians.  I don't think Muslims deserve any special treatment above and beyond that.  Judge them based on who they are, not their religion.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Both holy books say to kill lots of people for silly reasons, and the majority of practitioners ignore those parts of the book.

Just a fyi. Looks like the top quote or "positive" post is from the Quran. The negative quotes are from Sunni hadiths (not Quran). 

He may have just been a contrarian. Has anyone contacted the r/worldnews mods about this?

edit: ~~nevermind. yup, apparently he's a self labeled troll (read archive/comment history).~~</div>

    <div class="md">I think there're two factors here:

* Unlike Christianity, Islam is seen as a non-white, non-European religion.
* The most important virtues of "liberal progressives" (most of whom are white) are being non-racist and tolerant of other people's cultures

So they feel free (in fact they have a need) to criticize Christianity, but bend over backwards to appease Islam to demonstrate how non-racist and tolerant they are.

    <div class="md">There's an obvious race aspect at play here, but I'm not surprised people dance around it. 

You can actually see whiffs of it in the /r/politics crowd reaction to the current LGBT-Chechnya situation, where they are pretty clearly trying to paint Chechens as "Russian" and deflect from the fact it's been a Muslim community for around 800 years.

That said I don't think the average American "progressive" could point to Chechnya on a map.</div>

    <div class="md">It's so baffling, i would consider myself a liberal progressive and for the same reason i dislike Islam (don't lump me in with people that hate muslims, there's a difference).

This [clip](https://youtu.be/VW1pdY3sNcA?t=1m17s) in particular makes my blood boil. Is Trevor Noah really that stupid, or does he not understand that you can have a problem with Islam but not with Muslims. (btw i don't agree with Wielders on most things so i don't really like him. I hate Islam but i hate nationalism more.)

Some of the people in the left are incapable of criticizing Islam and don't want to allow other to criticize it also. They can't separate religion from the people (btw neither can most people on the right so they aren't much better), like the retarded Ben Affleck.</div>

    <div class="md">We support equality and the constitution.  If you're going to ban muslims, ban christians and all religions too.  You can't set the precedent that this religion is ok but not this one.

It's not about the religion with refugees from Syria.  It's about humans in need.  There aren't any christian nations that have recently collapsed that have a bunch of christian refugees.  If there were, i'd hope we could help them too.

    <div class="md">It's not baffling at all if you are older than 40 years. Before the 1990s, christians in the united states were a unified voting block, and they voted primarily republican/conservative. 

This voting block was essentially broken up in the 1990s by Bill Clinton's presidential team when they made 'a woman's right to an abortion' a NATIONAL issue. By marrying abortion to the democratic platform and  forcing the issue, they destroyed the unified christian voting block because certain christian sects/groups are adamantly against abortion based on religious grounds, while other denominations do not have any feelings for or against it what so ever. By pretending free abortions are a woman's right issue, the christian voting block imploded on it self and the democrats have done everything in their power to make sure it never unifies ever again.

This some how evolved into an out right hatred for all christians in general, and now that christianity is on a decline in the western world, the democrats have embraced islam and are desperately trying to prop it up as the go to religion for democrats who need an imaginary friend outside their otherkin transgenderqueer headmates.  

Another aspect is the financial side. While the democrats are the first to point fingers at people like trump for taking dirty russian money, the democrats have been sucking at the saudi arabian money teet for 30+ years now. </div>

    <div class="md">It's the latter. Shithead mods like EightRoundsRapid rarely have "real" reasons for the bans they hand out because they're motivated by political suppression, not legitimate rule violations.

The standards are different, too:

Call someone a Trumpist Nazi cunt who should kill themselves? Comment removed, warning, **no ban**.

Speak ill of Islam? Comment removed, no warning, permaban.

I'd love to have a look through the mod logs of a large biased subreddit just to see how differently comments are treated by the mods based on the politics of the person who made them.

    <div class="md">You're misunderstanding. They aren't all equal in practice.

The point is though that it is never about the "letter of the law". You can do this same thing -- citing reprehensible passages in the Bible too. But Christians don't hold to those passages strictly anymore. And the Muslims that you are debating also don't hold to those reprehensible passages, or they compartmentalize them.

These direct quotations are always met by the same rebuttal: this is not what *religion* is *to me or my family, or my congregation*.

I think those who want to stand up to the oppression of religion need to come up with a more nuanced attack method than using literal direct quotations. Logic is not going to win against religious belief. You're bringing logic to a feelings fight.</div>

    <div class="md">Christianity is very violent in third world countries, too. It's more about where Christianity generally is than the religion itself that gives it the appearance of somehow being an inherently better religion. 

edit: they are all the same.

    <div class="md">&gt; and you use /r/t_d.

Which *links* to new sources / memes - many of which have to be read/interpreted very carefully, because just like in other subs (probably even more so), there's a tendency to pick and choose and over-celebrate - BUT: I have come to see *facts* about the MSM that I had never seen before (but suspected a little, because I had seen unacceptable bias and filtering in the MSM myself already) *on their own websites*, for example.

By now, my opinion is this: People should try to dance on the dark side for a few days and then return to where they came. They will be richer. T\_D is *not* idiotic, and it is *not* a waste of time!</div>

    <div class="md">That melt down either didn't happen, or I overlooked it while browsing T_D for hours every day after I "discovered" it 2 weeks ago. My guess is the former. You can try to disprove me if you want, but in case you have some material, mind that I agree with bacon_flavored's response:

&gt; Yeah melt down have you even seen reality? We unanimously expressed shock at how badly France screwed itself and then stayed clearly how they deserve what they get now. 

If you still have something that justifies to say

&gt; you guys had a complete melt down when Le Pen lost

then I'm highly interested in seeing it.</div>

How do *you* feel about Canada having special (lenient) gun rights for Muslims? NO PHOTO ID!

https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6861aa/london_man_grapples_and_disarms_radical_islamic/dgwe71f/?context=3

Regarding Lefties and SJWs etc., I agree 100% with this guy, and I *wished* (But can't expect.) that you watch the whole 7:53 of it, not just the first 2 minutes or whatever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVrfGga7BUc

And I just searched my whole comment history but couldn't find the YouTube link to Trump's speech from 2016 where he pointed out two examples where people without guns were taken down by Islamists *in the USA* because they had no way to defend themselves, one group of which were elite fighters who had to leave their weapons in some locker because they were in a no-weapons zone. That worked out well, didn't it.</div>

    <div class="md">Canadian ndp voter and I'm not allowed to use a subreddit now?

Yknow users like me who a year ago thought trump was a joke made their way to t_d because I couldn't even find front page news on censored Reddit anymore, yet I found every news article I was looking for on the_donald.  In fact it was a massive controversy at the time and like always Reddit admins locked and deleted the self threads that dared discuss Reddit not having breaking news on its front page if it painted Islam in a bad way, and it locked and deleted the threads telling people they could find their breaking news on the Donald of all places.

It's one of the only real functioning subreddits now and that's sad as fuck that Reddit has been taken over by advertisers.</div>

    <div class="md">LOL I like to use news aggregation services not individual media outlets it seems like that's a no brainer to any reddit user.

A year ago i thought trump was a joke(I'm canadian, i've never even seen the apprentice), but then I saw front page posts on "the_donald" (dafuq i thought at the time) that had news story that weren't being featured on the rest of the site and i thought.. dafuq... and i've been getting uncensored news ever since.

They also post almost every 2 days that hillary clinton is a side of beef bro hahaha I love it, they really get to you eh?</div>

    <div class="md">I try not to comment on Reddit but came across this sub via Trump news. I gotta say, I agree that the censorship is out of control, but all of you should know to do your own research.  

I am a not so great Muslim who questions everything all the time. Which lead me to question everything in the above post. I believe the comment should not have been deleted, but none the less, the negative response is misleading and completely out of context.   
  
  1) Positive response quotes from the Quran, what Muslims believe to be the word of God and where the rules of Islam truly lie  
  
  2) Negative response quotes from Hadiths, which are teachings and words of the Prophet, but are not taken as rules for Islam, are debated on a regular basis, and should be put into context of the time period. OP even admitted it was a Hadith (although mistakenly says its the highest authority when the Quran is), but the regular joe would not know the significance of that.   
  
  2a) When googling the first negative statement, I came across a website that puts that comment into context. The website says the Prophet said this in regards to traveling to confront a Jewish tribe about violating a peace treaty. Is this website correct? Not necessarily, but that gives a pretty good reason IMO, especially since as explained above the Quran trumps Hadith 100% and the Quran says: 'When you are greeted with a greeting, greet with one better than it or return it.' (4:86)
Source: http://abuaminaelias.com/force-non-muslims-to-the-side-of-the-road/  
  
3) He claims he can pull negative statements from the Quran, but does not offer any. If it was so easy, why would he not have taken the short amount of time to do it?   
  
4) The second negative statement I do not classify as negative, but just a religious doctrine being kinda...out there. The statement is not saying anything negative about Jews, just that there will be war, and apparently trees and rocks will choose sides...   
  
  
Now the comment should NOT have been deleted to allow for this discussion, but the comments in here are pretty mob mentality (at least the negative ones I saw). Always two sides to a coin.

    <div class="md">I'm shocked that this is so low. Reddit usually reassures me in instances like this by reminding others to keep in mind context, and in doing so we almost always see the bigger picture rather than the one OP was attempting to create. However, it's really frustrating and frankly scary that in this instance I had to scroll so far down just to see anything remotely reasonable, as opposed to the people who have done *no research at all* and are falling prey to mob mentality/misleading statements. 

And the worst part is I doubt the thousands of people coming here will even see this comment. All they'll do is read the ones that confirm the opinion they formed after seeing the title and move on without a second glance. It's sad.

**Edit:** And the fact that people are downvoting your comment because they think it "disagrees" with their viewpoint, when it is in fact simply stating truths easily found through quick research, is even more disheartening. If the facts go against whatever bias you have, then I think that says a lot more about the validity of your viewpoint rather than the motive of the person who said those facts.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, I was also skeptical when I saw him pull all his negative comments from hadith.

It's literally the word of God (Quran) vs the word of man (Hadith)

A hadith, in Islam, is a proverb that is so profound that it is widely spread around. As you may have gathered, the proverb is contained in the timeframe of that society, as is a direct response to the situation in that time.

If there were to be a hadith in this time, it would be along the lines of

"Do not greet the men of America first, and if there are multiple paths, choose the better path for yourself."

You may think, oh! this is negative. Remember, however, that Muslim countries are currently occupied and under attack by American soldiers.

So, in light of the wars being fought, the most negative thing the hadith says is to not say hello first, and to make sure you take the easier road?

That's my take on it though.

I'd hope his comment goes higher up though because he makes some sound points.</div>

    <div class="md">https://quran.com/9/25-35

The above link is a 10 verse spread surrounding your quote of 9:30.

From this, you can gather that Allah does not like people attributing "Godliness" to anyone other than Him. As in Islam, shirk (polytheism: The act of having multiple Gods) is the biggest sin of all and the punishment for it is Hellfire. Now, you may be saying, "Gotcha! it's violent indeed!" but keep in mind hellfire is a punishment in a lot of religions.

Christianity has the phrase, "Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord an Savior" (lest ye burn in Hellfire)

The Jewish faith also believes in Hellfire, so the concept of punishment is not exclusive to one religion.

Onto the violent part that you highlighted, "May Allah destroy them". It seems violent doesn't it? However, if you see a crime committed, would you not say, "Let the judge handle it"? We say, "let the judge handle it" and not "let the judge destroy them" because judges do not have the divine power of omnipotence, so the party in question could still be innocent.

Before God, there is not doubt, so a certainty in judgment is understandable. Now, the sentence, "May Allah destroy them" is also telling Muslims to back off. It's not their job, duty, or responsibility to confront disbelievers or polytheists. God will handle it.

&gt; 2:190 Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.

Fight those who fight you, but fight only in defense. Do not impose yourselves on them. Do not take more than you lost.

&gt;2:192 And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

Once again, fight for defense, not spoils of war.

&gt;2:193 Fight them until there is no [more] fitnah and [until] worship is [acknowledged to be] for Allah . But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.

Fight the aggressors until they either convert to your religion, or until they cease oppressing your people.

https://quran.com/2/190-200

This passage is about war against an oppressive force. An army has occupied a Muslim nation. Other Muslim nations are instructed by God to greet them in battle and "Expel them from wherever they have expelled you"

&gt; And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.

Al-Masjid Al-Haram is a holy site. Most of you will recognize it as the Kabba, in Mecca. This statement is forbidding fighting in this holy site, but allowing self defense if others attempt to attack you there.

God sends down this message as a direct command. You must free your brothers and sisters from oppression. These oppressing nations conquered lands by attacking small nations one at a time, while talking diplomacy with other nations. Their motto you may have heard before, and which this verse is meant to be a direct counter to: "Divide and Conquer"

Allah is saying "Unite and Defend yourselves"

I pulled my source from Quran.com, which is an unbiased translation of the Quran. You pulled your quotes from a website dedicated to painting Islam in a bad light. I'd be hard pressed to believe that site has any interest in scholarly dissection of the Quran.

    <div class="md">You literally have dying in a hell fire a pass because "other religions do it too". That's not how you prove something doesn't exist that's how you give it a pass.  Oh and you don't understand Judaism if you think it has hellfire. Judaism doesn't even have a hell. 

You also have he destroying of Jews and Christians a pass because 'god doesn't make mistakes like human judges do'. 

Then you tried to argue that it's only self defense which isn't true. 
&gt;
Quran (2:191-193) - "And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing... but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun(the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)" (Translation is from the Noble Quran) The verse prior to this (190) refers to "fighting for the cause of Allah those who fight you" **leading some to claim that the entire passage refers to a defensive war in which Muslims are defending their homes and families.  The historical context of this passage is not defensive warfare, however, since Muhammad and his Muslims had just relocated to Medina and were not under attack by their Meccan adversaries.  In fact, the verses urge offensive warfare, in that Muslims are to drive Meccans out of their own city (which they later did).  Verse 190 thus means to fight those who offer resistance to Allah's rule (ie. Muslim conquest).**  The use of the word "persecution" by some Muslim translators is disingenuous - the actual Arabic words for persecution (idtihad) - and oppression are not used instead of fitna.  Fitna can mean disbelief, or the disorder that results from unbelief or temptation.  A strict translation is 'sedition,' meaning rebellion against authority (the authority being Allah).  This is certainly what is meant in this context since the violence is explicitly commissioned "until religion is for Allah" - ie. unbelievers desist in their unbelief.  [Editor's note: these notes have been modified slightly after a critic misinterpreted our language. Verse 193 plainly says that 'fighting' is sanctioned even if the fitna 'ceases'.  This is about religious order, not real persecution.]</div>

It's not like the mod knows that those quotes are not from the Quran anyway.

https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/quran/violence.aspx

There's some negative verses from the Quran. Like killing Jews and Christians or that allah will destroy them for not being Muslim.  Or that not believing, in general, warrants your death.

Edit: you're being  ingenuous if you're claiming that it's only about verbal fights or fistfights. The Quran explicitly calls for beheading and cutting off fingertips.

  I find it interesting that I now have seen over 10 posts about negativity and violence, and these two verses are the only ones quotes over and over again. So even if those 2 are as negative as they seem, but the other 99.9% is not violent, then what? </div>

    <div class="md">I'm not devoting too much time to this charade. That's why I quoted those two, there's no way to justify them as being peaceful. 

As to your question: if those two are as negative as they seem and are the only ones (they're not) the other 99.9% doesn't matter because these call for the total destruction of non Muslims which means it's a religion of violence to all who don't obey so who gives a shit what the rest says?  Nobody who believes in religious freedom.

    <div class="md">Also 3wtg3gtaq, the user who got banned for "trolling," is a brand new account which is massive red flag for an obvious concern troll only there to stir shit up. There's no denying that this is a practice employed on both sides of Reddit's political spectrum, so it's not fair to say only one side does this, but it's such an obvious ploy by trolls that most AutoMods have to be set to delete comments by baby accounts until the account has enough karma to prove they're not just a shit-tier troll.

And now 3wtg3gtaq is posting in all the very obvious right-leaning subs looking for easy sympathy and pats on the back for "exposing the liberal bias" that literally every Redditor who has been here longer than month is perfectly aware of. Next, they're gonna try to act surprised when they get banned from politics for calling everyone a "cuck." 

Considering that this sub is modded by two users with clear political biases, though, it's almost laughable that anyone can come here decrying the censorship of other mods when it's pretty obvious that the only censorship being talked about on this sub is the censorship on left-leaning subs, but fuck-all about the censorship on right-leaning subs.

I mean, c'mon guys, the two mods here are also the mods of Nationalism, EuropeanNationalism, and several other far-right subs, and you're all pretending that cognitive dissonance is a purely liberal phenomenon?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm going to comment again on this main comment for visibility because while you may be right about his quotes coming from the Hadith,
Your larger point about (3) not being able to quote negativity from the Quran is laughable and your opinion about rocks and trees calling for the death of Jews not being negative is insane. 

Here's a quote directly from the Quran, NOT the Hadith. 


[Verse 2:191](https://quran.com/2/191-201)

&gt;**And kill them wherever you overtake them** and expel them from wherever they have expelled you, and fitnah is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al- Haram until they fight you there. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers.

[Verse 9:30](https://quran.com/9/30-40)

'May allah destroy Jews and Christians'

&gt;The Jews say, "Ezra is the son of Allah "; and the Christians say, "The Messiah is the son of Allah ." That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved [before them]. **May Allah destroy them**; how are they deluded?</div>

    <div class="md">You'll see this all the time when you debate Muslims. They're incredibly disingenuous. They'll twist whatever quotes they can into something positive in an attempt to make Islam look peaceful when it has never been a peaceful religion.

You can't have a religious text be peaceful and also call for the killing​ of those who don't believe. That may be peaceful to Muslims but not to anyone else.

The sad thing is that when Muslims act like there's nothing violent about Islam people actually fall for it. That's how we've ended up with so many saying 'those poor Muslims, they're criticised for nothing.' People are way too easily convinced without bothering to research for themselves.</div>

    <div class="md">So religious texts saying to fight and kill until those that oppose them convert to Islam is peaceful? What is considered oppressing Muslims today is different to many Muslims to what it was when the Quran was written. Some Muslims already do view the West as an oppressor and can justify their violence against Western nations with the Quran alone. When you use the hadiths it becomes even easier to justify this violence against those who aren't Muslim or who aren't the right kind of Muslim.

I had already seen the post you linked before I made my post, it was actually the type of post that I was referring to. Its the usual Muslim/Muslim apologist who makes even the verses that encourage or justify violence sound like Islam is still peaceful when it's these very verses that are enough to convince Muslims to commit acts of violence.</div>

This always gets brought up when people criticise Islam and it's not even true. I'm not even religious myself so I don't have a bias to one religion over the other, it's just clear which religion consistently proves itself to be the least peaceful. A number of quotes have been mentioned by commenters above which encourage violence against those that don't believe in Islam, can you show me the same call to violence in other religions?

  It crazy you make this claim about Christianity and other religions not being violent: 
" Book of 1 Samuel, when God instructs King Saul to attack the Amalekites: "And utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them," God says through the prophet Samuel. "But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey."

    <div class="md">Well lets be clear the Hadith in question does not call for the KILLING or DEATH of anyone. It says the word fighting, which is very very different. Also the Hadith is not calling out for the blind killing of people, but claiming that there will be war. Are you saying that there is no legitimate reason in the world ever to go to war? The US and all of history for that matter might disagree...  
  
  The reality is, old religious doctrines of all religions need to put in context, and people interpret them differently. Again, it is very important to read the whole story, not just one sentence. 
  1) Verse 2:191 you posted has many many sites explaining the context of the situation. Even with the context it is not all rosy, but are you really expecting a whole religion to be as peaceful as a complete pacifist? Couldn't this verse be taken as a version of the US popular quote "Don't Tread on Me" or "Fire on sight"? And while this verse can be interpreted many ways, this one is pretty straight forward: 5:22 "Whoever kills a soul unless it be for murder or sowing discord in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity" and "whoever saves a person is as though he has saved all of humanity." So killing innocent people is completely out of the question.  
  
2) Here is a verse, that I can agree looks negative to most. And while my interpretation does not justify it, it is important to note that this verse still does not advocate what we know today as Muslim extremism: 1) The reason why this verse is so harsh is because having a "son of god" goes against one of the biggest beliefs of Muslims, that there is only one higher being, and that is God. 2) EVEN THEN this verse does not say "Go out and kill all the Jews and Christians" it says "May God destroy them". Doesn't necessarily justify it, but at the same time, it in no way advocates violence and killings. </div>

    <div class="md">Your "whoever kills a soul is as if they killed all humanity" doesn't mater if the religion doesn't believe it applies to non Muslims. 

That phrase alone doesn't justify killing Jews by Muslims, it only shows that Muslims pray that their god will kill Jews for them.  Correct. But when you put it in the context of 'fight for me against all who transgress/disbelieve in allah' it's quite easy to see how it's used to justify killing Jews.  Either way Islam is not a religion of peace to non Muslims and has **absolutely no place** in a world that would allow religious freedom as it's very core doctrine teaches that it is unacceptable to not be Muslim. Oppression is a core principle of islam.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't agree with the word "warlord".  
  1) The very first excerpt from the Quran from the link you posted shows that the Quran says fighting is only allowed when you have been wronged, when you are kicked out of your home for saying "I am a Muslim". To me, all that means is God believes in the right to religious freedom, just like our founding fathers.  
  2)Those times were riddled with religious wars. The crusades were a blood bath. I never saw any proof (relative term) that the Prophet went to war just for the sake of it, or that he liked the taste of blood, or any personality trait that would label him as a "war mongerer"  </div>

    <div class="md">I'm the one that commented there.

Hadiths are integral to Islam. Which is the main problem that most people don't get, that is they assume Islam = Quran. However, Islam = Quran+Hadiths. Most Islamic law is derived from the Sunnah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah , that is the life and teachings of Mohammed. Quran has little to none of that, it's extensively covered in Hadiths. Quran also references Mohammed as an exalted (standard of) character which is what makes the Hadiths integral to Islam.

When I mentioned the two are the highest authority hadiths it obviously meant they are the highest authority ones AMONG the rest of the Hadiths. Hadiths come in different degrees of authenticity, which is why it's not a good idea to quote lower authority ones (and which is why I've chosen sahih ones). The debates in Islam is whether to accept other Hadiths except sahih (authentic) ones like Bukhari Muslim etc, for example including hasan (good) Hadihs. You can read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith

As I said in the original comment, Quran has plenty of examples as well, and there's even more in Hadiths. My concern was to remind people that sahih Hadiths are integral to Islam, there's no such thing as Quran only Islam. That's just Quranists, a small group of people considered apostates by rest of muslims.

/u/ikulol this should cover your concern as well.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, Hadiths are integral to Islam, but it is important to note:  
 1) Hadiths are absolutely not taken as law or the rule of the land. They are known as suggestions as this is how the Prophet lived his life.  
  2) Again, the context was "Don't say a greeting first because we are going to argue about breaking a peace treaty", in that context the quote, IMO, is warranted.    
  3) Hadiths, the Quran, and any religious doctrine for that matter is up for interpretation, in fact some Imams in Islam encourage to challenge and discuss different interpretations. People understand the words differently. That's how you get extremists (ISIS, cults, etc), middle, and lax people in ALL religion.  
  
Here is the other thing, I am sure there is a bunch of stuff in the Quran that you would see as negative, even I find some sayings I do not agree with completely. Does a couple verses in the Quran about war and the supposed future mean that all Muslim are angry extreme killers? Come on. The positive of the Quran far outweighs the negative, and that I will vehemently stand by.  
  
Thanks for the respectful response. I can't really discuss anything with people that tell me to get off my camel and go home (even though I was born here). </div>

    <div class="md">&gt; The positive of the Quran far outweighs the negative, and that I will vehemently stand by.

It doesn't, but we would obviously disagree on that. 

The concern is, and i'm not trying to be disrespectful, is that Islam is bipolar. Yes, there's obviously good stuff there, nobody can deny that. There's lots of bad stuff there also, and that's the problem. The main problem is the example Mohammed was, since he is the standard for muslims. Yes, he did nice things, but he also did an awful lot of reprehensible things, yet he's paradoxically an exemplary character.

Compared to Jesus of Christianity, Mohammed is not even a contender.

Sahih Hadiths are not up for interpretation, or at best there's a very small margin for which they can be interpreted. They have to exist and be accepted because Quran on itself does not offer that much information.

Yes, that's about Banu Qurayza.

&gt;He then killed their men and distributed their women, children and property among the Muslims, but some of them came to the Prophet and he granted them safety, and they embraced Islam.

&gt;When the tribe of Banu Qurayza was ready to accept Sad's judgment, Allah's Apostle sent for Sad who was near to him. Sad came, riding a donkey and when he came near, Allah's Apostle said (to the Ansar), "Stand up for your leader." Then Sad came and sat beside Allah's Apostle who said to him. "These people are ready to accept your judgment." Sad said, "I give the judgment that their warriors should be killed and their children and women should be taken as prisoners." 

That's from Bukhari also. So yes, he was referring to the jews initially, and that's what happened to them eventually. He was also referencing Christians for some reason

The point is that the initial quote is just a small part of the attitude muslims have over other religions (especially non abrahamic ones). The second quote was supporting the first. We can go an find countless ones both in Quran and other sahih Hadiths. 

&gt;Does a couple verses in the Quran about war and the supposed future mean that all Muslim are angry extreme killers? Come on.

It's not just Quran, it's Hadiths too. And it's not just a couple of verses, it's about the attitude and the example of Mohammed. Generally muslims are nice until you do something that is considered hostile, whatever that is. Then you're fucked.

I am not saying Islam is perfect and all must bow down, however you are definitely spreading misinformation. Hadiths are absolutely disputed and discussed, I am speaking from experience.

It's not about today's society. Societies change, the texts remain. The texts/teachings (Quran and Hadith) are bipolar.

&gt;but so is EVERY OTHER RELIGION.

No it isn't. One example would be Christianity, others would be Buddhism, Janism.

&gt;are 100% rule and law

Didn't say 100%, I specifically said:

&gt;Sahih Hadiths are not up for interpretation, or at best there's a very small margin for which they can be interpreted.

So while yes, you might end up refuting some specific verses, there will be others backing them up and on the grand scheme of things the context would be the same (intolerance for other religions, violence in "self defense" and many others.

The final nail in the coffin for Islam is his own prophet, Mohammed. By his actions he has shaped Islam.</div>

    <div class="md">I'd advise you to actually read the Bible instead of trusting what other parties tell you about Christianity. Understanding Christianity also takes way less time than Islam because unlike Islam, everything is in one book - the Bible.

Given Christianity's structure, it would actually be sufficient to read the Gospels only, since they have Highest authority and take about 4-5 hours to read.

Text analysis on Bible is not relevant because Bible is comprised of Old and New Testament. The two happen thousands of years apart. The New Testament is like an additional contract signed for an initial contract. Yes, Old Testament was violent to some extent, however the New Testament teachings, through Christ, basically forbid human punishment. So Old Testament rules only apply if not contradicted implicitly or explicitly by the New Testament.

Quran is violent mostly because it's directly inspired from Old Testament.

Text analysis also returns false positives on New Testament because it considers parts that refer to divine judgement (mainly Revelations but also others). The difference between Christianity and Islam is that for Christianity punishment by people is forbidden, it's strictly reserved to God.

I've written a post covering one of the issues people have with New Testament here if you're interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/6a6w6a/rworldnews_muslim_posts_a_list_of_positive_quotes/dhd9af3/

But as I said initially, i'd advise you not to trust me either, just go and read the Bible.

    <div class="md">Here's some real negative statements straight from the quran, context available.

Women are men's property that they can use whenever they feel like (2:223). They are worth less in trial as witnesses (2:282) and have got half the right to heritage compared to men (4:11, 4:176). If they do not obey, strike them (4:34).

Islam is the one true religion, other followers are losers:

We don't like a religious group that self identifies as the enemy of other religions.

    <div class="md">You haven't noticed the continued attack on abortion access and gay marriage?  The fact your current President is doing it right now?

ETA: Pence has described himself as “a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.”  So yeah, your VP, one step from the power, is a Christian before anything else.  But that has no bearing on any of his policies.... like how he supports gay conversion therapy and wants abortion to be inaccessible.  </div>

    <div class="md">Even without religion, abortion would still be a questionable practice. I'm sure you will find christians,Jews,Muslims,Buddhists... and atheists, who think that abortion (unless exceptional circumstances) is wrong.

Leaving religion out of it doesn't make the practice 100% acceptable. 

Gay MARRIAGE - marriage itself is a religious thing. Inb4 but salon said it isn't - we both know that true marriage is religious, otherwise it's a civil marriage right ?

If you want to throw god away and cringe at anybody who says the name. Then why do you care about who can and can't get married in a church ? 

Shouldn't you be cringing at the word marriage too ?

    <div class="md">Damn right I would and here's a few reason why 

I don't want fixed marriages and inbreeding 

To see woman covered from head to toe in a burka

The unnecessary cruelty towards animals that makes food halal 

To have to remove our flags, Christmas trees and every other tradition because they are labeled offensive 

Having to see gay people I know thrown from rooftops because of their life choice.

Those are a tad bit worse than not saying a few words on an alter or refusing to murder unborn babies.. don't ya think ?

And like I previously said. Even when the church and state are separated it doesn't make abortion 100% acceptable. A foetus is being destroyed. You are ending a life and it's not only the church who object to this

Gays can still have civil marriages but no church or priest should be forced into doing something it doesn't want to....well just because the state says so. You want them separated right ?

    <div class="md">Notice how this comment has no likes. The other guy is arguing in Jewish interests and he doesn't like what you said about Israel. It's a team game my friend. He's clearly upvoted every other post you have made but not this one. 

He has a side, I have a side but I'm not sure you do. I was the same way about 10 years ago until the joys of diversity woke me up.

I don't even blame Israel for wanting to remain white/Jewish. I just don't like how much influence they have on pushing the third world into the first. 

I'm heading out now, I'll reply if you do but it might be later tonight or tommorow. Enjoy your day/evening </div>

    <div class="md">As I stated earlier, You can't rely on written contracts or taped confessions to verify the obvious or not so obvious truth.

Sometimes you have to look at things from outside the narrative to understand the truth.

For instance: diversity is our strength... united we fall ?

In the age of the Internet, Those who unquestionably go along with the official narrative are now the tin foiled hatters. </div>

    <div class="md">Not really. Jeff Sessions is an idiot and should never have been given power. Hillary is an old evil crone puppet to globalists. Bernie is a traitorous hypocrite who could have made a real difference but just ended up being another disappointment. Trump is a big bad white man oooooh and Islam is a plague that should be wiped from existence. Just like the pathetic lefties of the US and France who deserve everything they get.</div>

    <div class="md">There is hope. It's called The Right. It's called Patriotism. It's called Making America Great Again. I voted bernie in the primaries and was betrayed by him. I see him for the traitorous hypocrite he is now. I voted Trump against Hillary and was still on the fence when it came to the meme wars. But the more I see the steaming pile of insanity that is the left, the further right I am pushed. I would rather be insulted by reddit snowflakes, shills, and censors, then ever be associated with these idiots.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm canadian actually and you sound a bit ignorant, and you're comparing apples to oranges.

 it's because in Canada we have had christian vs catholic french tension for all our history, and so bringing it up politically is a hot button issue and has always been considered vote pandering and tawdry.

Whereas in america they have always been predominantly christian and every single president for a loooooong time has said god bless america etc, it's just a tradition that no one dares to break. 

Obama, clinton , Bush etc, sure they all said god bless america this and that but do you really see them being hardline religious? no they're just moderate christmas celebrators like you and me.</div>

    <div class="md">Liberals still don't understand literal cultural appropriation by unfaithful of your lifestyle.

Apparently gays HAD to co opt a Christian institution even though it specifically forbids it.

Civil union that's identical in every way isn't good enough, we demand to appropriate Christian tradition.

I'm fine with it, the irony is just thick as boards.

And yes a small an atheist I'm not pro life or pro choice I'm pro PERSONAL RESPONSIBILTY.  When this mind blowing belief doctrine of personal responsibility is strictly adhered to you will find that you never accidentally make a baby and thus never need an abortion! Oh you say fuck personal responsibility? I say fuck you!

The only abortions should be medically NECCESSARY abortions should the pregnancy threaten the mother, I won't trade death for death.

    <div class="md">This tired old "gay conversion" line is so ridiculous. It was from a quote from decades ago and is not something he's even spoken about for decades. Meanwhile, less than a decade ago both Obama and Hillary were firmly against gay marriage, but you'll give them a pass.

As for abortion, you realize that over half of all aborted babies are black or hispanic, right? Why are you so in favor of killing minority babies?</div>

    <div class="md">Aka, you want the government (taxpayers) to pay for your life. 

I haven't advocated anything, just told you the statistics. Minority babies are the #1 victims of abortion and you support that. It's amazing to me that in a liberals mind it's "racial justice" to not kill babies, rather than just the right thing to do.</div>

    <div class="md">Even the most careful people end up with pregnancy. 

But my point isn't about the programs I mentioned - you asked how to reduce abortion rates, I gave you an answer that has worked in other countries.  You don't like the answer, I'm sorry, but I won't get behind abortion bans / restrictions because you don't like the solution. 

My POINT is that way too much of your politics and governance is dictated by Christians and Christian morals.  Pence has said outright he is a Christian before ALL other things.  He answers to God before constituents.  It is dangerous (see climate change), it is discriminatory (see LGBTQ issues / Abortion), and it's just wrong if you want any semblance of a neutral, rational leadership. </div>

    <div class="md">Christian values built the west and the abandonment of them are foretelling our downfall. This is coming from a decade+ atheist willing to admit he was wrong about total abandonment of Christianity and it's values. The only values the other side holds is "I'm an individual more important than the whole".

Reducing abortions would be MOST effective by implementing modesty and values for our women again, rather than the foolish "liberation" that has seen women's happiness on a steady decline in the west and single motherhood and abortion skyrocket.</div>

I will never understand how Americans can completely ignore the rest of the world and throw up their hands and say, "It simply isn't possible".

Canadians pay less per person for healthcare than Americans.  And we can take our kids to the hospital and not be destituted. Shit is very possible.  You all just never look around.</div>

    <div class="md">No, you didn't. Not in a way that actually explains how to implement anything you claim is so simple and readily available. All you have is "just google it", or "I'm not writing an essay". Which is funny, because if it was such an easy thing you would actually be able to give a concise answer.

You can look at other countries, but as I've already said, the dynamics are different - The cost of setting up a system like that in a country the size of the US would be astronomical (once again I repeat, a very large country with trillions worth of debt already). How much of the military budget do you cut? And what of the ramifications of reducing that budget? </div>

    <div class="md">Oh my god. They have the biggest military in the world *many, many* times over.  They have tons of waste in spending, I'm sure. Even if they use every blessed dollar perfectly and every dollar is needed - why does their military need to be many times larger than anyone else?  Maybe it's time to stop creating wars and start investing in their people.  You just don't want to remotely admit that it's ridiculous that *only* the States are incapable of universal healthcare.

Completely irrelevant to this conversation. And you didn't answer the question, again, what about the ramifications of reducing the military budget? You've no doubt given absolutely zero thought about the many jobs that would be lost, and the impact it would have on the countries geopolitical standing.

I'm not against universal healthcare at all, but I'm capable of understanding that it isn't realistic for the US to implement such a system without completely crippling their society. Unlike you. </div>

    <div class="md">Raise taxes by how much? What about the issues that stem from raising taxes in an already struggling economy? How much do you divert from the military to a universal healthcare system? A lot of jobs would be lost, and if those people who lose their jobs then struggle to find work afterwards they might then have to go on welfare, which would wind up costing more. Plus you've already raised their taxes. Not to mention the ramifications on the geopolitical standing of the US.

If we lose jobs in the military sector, can't more jobs be made in the healthcare area? The US military is already completely over funded, with 601 billion dollars going into it in 2015. Diverting even 50 billion will be barely a scratch, and that is quite a bit of money.</div>

    <div class="md">That's a cop out answer. 

It would probably create more jobs. But then you also have to factor in the added strain of what a universal healthcare system would bring - people being far more liberal about what they go to the doctors/hospital for (last time I went to A&amp;E there was a woman there who was concerned about having dirrahea, and who knows what other silly reasons people waste doctors time on when they know they don't have to pay for the the service), the added strain that would put on staff, and you have to factor in whether or not the current infrastructre is enough, or would more hospitals/general pratices/walk in centers have to be built, and how much that would cost? </div>

    <div class="md">Diarrhea can certainly be a side effect to many a bad illness. Perhaps it was overreacting, sure. Mabye not. Better safe than sorry, and with the system in Canada, lower priority issues (diarrhea, etc) would get bumped down to be treated after someone who may need actual surgery. The thing is, people are still paying for the service, but it counts on people being mutually respectful towards those providing the service. People are paying through taxes, just much less since everyone is paying the taxes but, say, only 25% of that percentage gets hospitalized for something more major each year. As for the infrastructure, there really is no way to tell at this point in the game. Will people abuse the system? Mabye. Mabye not. Will it have to be modified? Probably. The point is that a free healthcare plan is an important issue that the US government should focus on, as the US is one of the only countries without one.</div>

    <div class="md">Remember it only counts as a baby if the woman wants to keep it, otherwise it's not a living thing.

It's cool to have abortions because it's just a fetus, but if a woman gets tripped down the stairs and loses the baby it's murder.</div>

It's actually something a lot of black authors write about, the amount of black abortions seems to be contributing to black population decline. Furthermore there are more anti-abortion women than men and it's not strictly a religious issue.</div>

    <div class="md">Actually he never said anything about gay conversion at all.  That entire line of reasoning came from the Ryan White Care Act.

In that act there were parts to help people pay for HIV medication.  Well he didn't vote to replace it, he voted to put some of the money that was going to go towards HIV medication and putting it into teaching people to be less promiscuous.

So they turned that into him being for "gay conversion" therapy.  He is not a LGBTQ(PZSRK?) person supporter by any means, but that is just positively false, he never has said that, and as far as I know doesn't believe in that.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Obama and Hillary were firmly against gay marriage, but you'll give them a pass

Who says anyone is giving them a pass for that?  I voted against Hillary in the primaries because I don't agree with her past, her flip flopping, her overall attitude when it comes to politics.  In fact you're going to find a lot of redditors didn't want Hillary in office either.  Most of us wanted Bernie Sanders.  The only reason we voted Hillary was because we were voting *against* Trump.

Obama states his beliefs.

&gt; “I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.

But he also states its unconstitutional to infringe on their rights based on his religious beliefs.
&gt; But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that’s not what America’s about.

&gt; Every single American — gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender — every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law and in the eyes of our society. It’s a pretty simple proposition.

And while in office he acted on exactly that, helping protect the rights of all lgbt members.

So say what you will, but when it comes down to it, actions - not words - are what matters.  And Pence has acted according to his beliefs, he thinks homosexuality is a mental condition and that they should receive conversion therapy.</div>

Once you've been In a mature responsible relationship with a fellow adult you realize that abortions are a substitute for personal responsibility.  When you see it for what it is you realize it's a super fucked up thing to do just because you lacked personal responsibility and conviction.</div>

    <div class="md">You're a fucking moron. 

Abortion is not a right. Life is a right. 

No one is stripping away gay rights, rather, they're allowing the free market to be a free market, where business owners can choose to throw out patrons if they think serving them violates their religious beliefs. 

Need a gay wedding cake? Find a different bakery. That's how the free market works. 

Don't knock on a country you don't even live in. You've clearly never read our constitution or learned what our founding fathers advocated for. </div>

    <div class="md">There is often overlap between those forms of state.

In theory it could be Evangelicals, Muslims, Jews, Catholics, etc. who could hold office. So I called it the "Rule of the Few". Calling the US a theocracy seems too extreme for me so far, because in theory the protections of AND FROM religion are there.</div>

    <div class="md">Look at the timestamps. The first archive link shows the first comment but not the second; however, it is time-stamped well after the second comment was posted, which conclusively proves a selective removal.

I've made a good faith attempt at explaining the evidence, now it's your turn to make a good faith attempt at understanding it.

edit: interesting how you were very aggressive in asking for evidence, then fell silent once it was provided to you but went on to spew the same bullshit in other comments for hours after. Banned for concern trolling.</div>

It's totally different to post a counter-argument in a default sub only to have it get censored. This is why places like T_D are so active. </div>

    <div class="md">Well that's because libertarians are very Laissez Faire and like to let their users decide what's relevant. It's kind of our whole philosophy. Banning and censorship is almost non-existent. We even get brigaded by r/all from time to time but weather the storm.

It's the only sub out there like it, maybe aside from AnCaps.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; It's one thing to go to somewhere that has an obvious and clear bias that they don't hide, and post anti-whatever that sub is. You're gonna get censored there, and you shouldn't be surprised.

I was just replying to this. Just because someone has a clear bias, doesn't mean they're going to censor you. All these subreddits that do that are anti-intellectualism by creating an echo chamber that censors valid arguments.</div>

    <div class="md">There's one conservative leaning sub? The fuck are you talking about?

Look at the 17 fucking subs that RamblinRambo3 mods and tell me there's only one right-leaning sub on Reddit. Look at all the various subs the mods of EuropeanNationalism and Conservative run and tell me there's only one right-leaning sub.

Jesus Christ, this is some blatant willful ignorance.</div>

Do you guys actually have real rebuttals that aren't resorts to grade-school taunts, or are you so used to detractors being banned from your safe spaces that you've forgotten how to actually defend your position when called out? </div>

    <div class="md">If I remember correctly, /europeannationalism was designed and admitted as safe space /echochamber for conservatives back when /european was still up and admins didn't ax it. Idea was to keep /european free speech(and you could've literally posted everything there) and the other sub to be
more of a thing where people get away from others.

The issue here is that most conservative subs, and i do agree there are plenty, are truthful for their orientation or bias, whereas huge subs that are supposedly "neutral" by name such as /europe /worldnews /politics are obviously left leaning and no mod admits it, and they shape the sub's narrative.

T_D admitted it's a sub concerned with circlejerking and that to keep the momentum up will ban other opinions. I personally think that's dumb but then again, at least they're being honest about it.

    <div class="md">late stage capitalism is nuts

they genuinely believe that there's no such thing as a hierarchy of workers. like yeah it'd be a nice world if everybody got paid the same but come on. the guy at the hotel who does valet is *not* doing as big of a job as the person who does all the bookkeeping.  they genuinely believe that factory employees should be paid the most for the products they make "because without them the product wouldnt exist", nevermind the people who created the product, and if you explain to them that logic spreads through thousands of people who make the individual pieces, the molds for those pieces, the materials for those molds and pieces, the delivery drivers, the designers, thousands and thousands of people involved in any given product, there's no feasible way to "fairly" split this up. they're nuts, they want to live in this magic post-money society that is never going to exist. 

and they ban you for saying things are *nuts*, because theyre *fucking nuts*</div>

    <div class="md">I was arguing with one where they said in an anarchist society no one would have to work and money would be non-existent. To which I said how would people eat? How would people have modern technology like we have today? He said, that people would get bored eventually and just start working on things and giving them away. Yeah like someone is going to go through the grueling process of making a flat screen TV only to give it away for free. This is also how you get bread lines and revert back to the stone age.

These people are so far off the deep end it's ridiculous. </div>

    <div class="md">Are you talking about the crusades? Because Muslims pretty much forced Christians out of all their holy cities centuries before. Not to say any of this is wrong, but it was a deadly response to a deadly action. This is how the world worked back then and how it would still work were it not for nukes and bombs. </div>

You're either lying or you have never looked into the hadith at all. Sahih Muslim is one of the six most authoritative hadith in Sunni Islam, as is Sahih al-Bukhari. Both the quoted hadith are they appear in the text, for example: https://sunnah.com/muslim/39/16</div>

    <div class="md">If you haven't heard of the hadiths, it's entirely your own failing. Only a minority of Muslims reject the hadiths. But, as Ihavetheinternets wrote, the hadiths do not have the same ideological clout as the Quran. That's why, whenever I am criticizing Islam, I go straight to the Quran. There is enough vile stuff in there to afford me the laxity to ignore the hadiths entirely.</div>

    <div class="md">So the actual problem here is the common assumption that the hadith's are considered so accurate by everyone. Literally everyone knows that both Muslim and Bulgaria collected verbally passed down 'hadiths' ages later. As I recall Muslim (the guy named Muslim) was 200+ years later. Just because some religious people regard these with high value really does not mean everyone does not does it mean it's a fair comparison to the Quran.

I'm sorry but if you take my Reddit post and then 250 years a guy with authority relates what he heard about my Reddit post, I would expect you to take it with a grain of salt. We've all played broken telephone so I feel it's a bit dishonest to consider this a fair comparison. </div>

    <div class="md">All of those peaceful quotes sound sarcastic, as if context *may reveal that these are platitudes that should be trotted out as a way to appear 'peaceful' when each quote is unspokenly followed by, "...now I must kill you."  
  
*or may not. I don't know, just observing the tone.

    <div class="md">As a mod...this is definitely not how you should reach out.

&gt;I want an explanation or I will be contacting Reddit admins about your abuse.

You mostly deal with dicks all day so don't be a dick and start making crazy threats out of nowhere or demands.  At that point the mods probably wrote him off and when he started spamming demanding answers in x hours...you mute them.  Everyone on the mod team would otherwise keep getting pinged about the conversation.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;They are not in the Quran, impossible to validate their authenticity. Anyone can say "that's fake" and he would probably be right.

Incorrect. Those are sahih (authentic) Hadiths. I've chosen them specifically over Quran to show people Islam is not Quran only. Providing Quran quotes, while easy, would've missed the Hadiths again.

    <div class="md">This is sickening. I'm outraged that someone as competent in the government as Ahok would be made a scapegoat on "blasphemy" charges that aren't legit just because the Islam majority in the country are too butthurt at a minority leader that doesn't favor corruption. And to have the response to this post be more censorship in favor of Islam? It's fucking ironic.

It saddens me to see more Westerners start to sympathize with Islam and believe in the whole "Islamaphobia" bs. A "phobia" implies an irrational fear of something; let me tell you, as a person that grew up in Indonesia, it is not at all irrational to fear the doctrines of Islam. </div>

    <div class="md">I'm Muslim and I will tell you that this post is misleading. Muslims believe the Quran is perfect and protected and written by God. We don't consider "Hadith" which is "Sahih Muslim" and "Sahih Bukhari" to be properly compiled.. as they were compiled 200 years after the Prophet passed away and are known to contain many errors.

That is why this isn't a fair comparison. If you want to dispute verses in the Quran, by all means, post it and we can provide proper context by viewing the surrounding verses. </div>

Sahih Hadith, mainly Bukhari and Muslim are pretty much standard in Islam (sunni Islam, 90% of all muslims). You should really learn more about how much authority they have.</div>

    <div class="md">The Quran did not have many running versions. Anybody who tried to write another version would be immediately exposed for their corruption, as God chose to protect this book until Judgment Day.

Also, if you want to dispute the Sahih Hadith, please go ahead and do so, it is encouraged. Many Western Muslims like myself find problems with it. You can also criticize those Muslims for giving it such high authority. But the nuance is, the Quran is perfect and any dispute you have with it can be easily crumbled for a lack of understanding or taking context with other verses. </div>

    <div class="md">Stuff like this is a surefire way to make more and more people hate Islam.

By treating Muslims like delicate little flowers and anyone who dares to question/criticize their believe system like they are evil.

As if Islamic terrorism isn't already bad enough for their publicity.

People who condemn the critics help spreading more hate than the critics themselves could.</div>

    <div class="md">edit:if you are going to read half my comment don't reply. Thanks
new edit: lmao if you going to down vote prove me wrong then do it :) don't just down vote because i'm saying the truth and you can't deny it lol


what op did by banning him really pisses me off sorry to hear that !!
first let me correct first quote in the negative comment about hadith muslim 2167, searched for it my self there is no such a hadith at all !!
totally wrong !
( because when i read it it was my first time to read such a thing, either bring your source).

and well ... i really respect the negative comment regard the fact that it explain to me that you absolutely know nothing or how to deal with Hadith and Ayat from Quran. plus not showing nor explaining the full view and respective to what you are saying.

for a short example : the second quote about judgmental day, like being honest here are you out of your mind ? like do you think nowadays that one muslim country can make a war on other non-muslim country ? 
beside the fact that it says in our Quran that killing one soul is like killing the whole humanity and shall the killer go to hell ? 
plus that quote is at the end of the time when people will be back to swords and stuff ... just dont say things you dont have full informations from.
and believe me muslims them self don't wanna live by that time.

so don't just go to internet and shallow websites and learn from them what they call it "islam" then pretend that your are "educated". and next time bring your sources! 

i really hate when people don't learn/get the full information and start ranting bad things about any religion ! 
like man if you want people to respect your religion respect theirs !

    <div class="md">ugh thank you i just knew that there's different in muslim english version and arabic one ! ( didn't knew that sorry )

and i checked it. it's traceable Hadith, which must have a certain conditions and qualifications to be accepted.( i don't know the whole conditions nor if this one is accepted )
but let's assume that it's 100% true and accepted, have you every visited a muslim country nowadays and they did that ? nope, they would be totally opposite on welcoming you people. plus yeah i know if it's 100% true i should do by it, but i think this hadith applies on their era's not ours. and the thing that i really dont think it's good to do by it is because like c'mon people will hate you for doing this thus will hate why you did it; so they will hate islam.

and about the second hadith i did not say that it's not true i said the opposite, that tells me you did not read my full comment :) ! 
same thing you guys always do read half thing and just judge by it !!! 
but anyway thank you so much because you replied to my comment and let me review few things and learn new stuff !!  </div>

    <div class="md">Dude, seriously... there is no need to learn or get full information to rant bad things about Islam. Worldwide, almost every day, innocent people are being killed in the name of Islam. That's enough to rant about. This isn't happening in anywhere near the same order of magnitude within any other religious context. All religions are fairy tales regardless - it's just a fucking shame that this most awful one results in so many innocents being assaulted, raped, tortured, and killed.

Every muslim I've personally known has been GREAT.

Islam is fucking cancer.</div>

    <div class="md">personally i see that anyone who's affected by the media is the one who has mind cancer.
so just deal with me a little bit i would like to explain something for you.
so a muslim person is a person who follows the islam. agreed ? same thing for christianity right ?
but what if that person doesn't follow the laws from the religion by not doing them? would we still say that he's a muslim/christian ? for me and in islam nope we don't.
so what happen if he do what's forbidden in his religion ? there's no argue with that he is totally not following his religion !!! 
SO in islam for a million times killing one human being is strictly forbidden and shall the killer go to hell, so do you think a real muslim will kill someone? nope, but a fake one would ! 
that's why i keep saying learn about the religion and DON'T JUDGE ANY RELIGION BY WHAT IT PEOPLE DOING.
plus the fact that anyone who is not muslim can go anywhere in public and shout "allah akhbar" and bomb him self. which is true and it happened !
 
and you said it yourself all the muslims you met are great but still your mind is affected by the media. this where you know how strong the media is it.

and please no need to use bad language against religions :) </div>

    <div class="md">You are correct that I am partially judging the religion by what some of its people are doing. I am also judging based on the fact that the Quran very clearly commands Muslims to kill non-Muslims. This is why Islam causes such a huge amount of violence and death to innocent civilians - orders of magnitude more than any other religion yields today.

Quran 8:12: "I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them"

Who are "those who disbelieve"?

Quran 8:13: Those who "defy and disobey Allah."

That's one of dozens and dozens of examples in the Quran that call for maiming, raping, and murder of non-Muslims. Now why should I care? Well, my country is accepting hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees. Some of these refugees assault and kill in the name of Allah, as the Quran tells them to. The refugees' actions have increased the rate of violent attacks in many destinations by many orders of magnitude.

Take a look at the map below. The locations of terrorist attacks directly correlate with Muslim refugee population.

    <div class="md">sorry i commented then i re-checked i was wrong on something.

so i read the quran 8:12 and what you quote is right but as always as everyone else you misunderstood plus you didn't even try to research before commenting, i searched on google and here what i found :

"
The historical context for the passages (Quran 8:12 and 8:15) is that it was revealed at the battle of Badr. A battle in which the disbelievers (Pagans) of Makkah travelled 100s of miles to kill Muslims in Madinah. The pagans had 1000 soldiers, while the Muslims all they could gather to fight back in defence, had only 300 soldiers. Even though Prophet Muhammad (p) had left Makkah to find peace for its community without being persecuted, oppressed, they once again were trying to terrorize the Muslim community. 
" 
plus you didn't bring the whole aya lmao bro if you gonna take half of quran aya's you will totally misunderstood it.
don't go and confront people with arguments that will show that you didn't understand well and didn't try to put efforts :) . 

ps : read the translation of any aya you gonna bring before commenting :) </div>

    <div class="md">It was written very clearly. You're going to wear your fingers to the bone if you try to justify every instance of the Quran inciting violence. I'm sure that there is always a context, or excuse, to justify murdering non believers.

Any written word is open to interpretation, sure. One religion is responsible for the staggeringly vast majority of religious attacks. That religion is dictated by the Quran. How can this be interpreted such that the religion is not the cause of so much violence?</div>

    <div class="md">hmmm i'm not sure that i did understand your comment very well (english is not my 1st language) but i think you should check this :
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_and_violence
i read a little bit from it it's really good and i think will answer most of your questions

and i would like to ask you what would be your action if some country make a war on yours ? wouldn't you defense ? or you will just let them kill your friends and family while watching ? that's why we are only allowed to use violence and kill if someone came to us in our country and try to destroy us.
Islam is a religion that contain everything details in human life from how to enter a bathroom and what to say, to what to say when you are about to sleep or the moment you woke up ! 
and since it's complete full detailed religion, shouldn't it also contain on how to defense yourself when someone try to kill you ? 

much appreciation on your replies.</div>

    <div class="md">I appreciate your replies too, and while English might not be your 1st language, your English is better than any of the non-English languages I use.

The point that I am really trying to drill down to is that the vast majority of religion-fueled violent incidents in the west are carried out in the name of Allah/Islam. Because of this fact (the data is plentiful and available) I consider Islam to be a bad thing when implemented in the west.

Again I will readily point out that all of the Muslims I know personally (which is 5, plus their families) are super nice people. A year ago there was a terrible natural disaster where I live. It destroyed the homes and lives of dozens of families. The only people, who I personally knew, that got off their asses and went to the site of the destruction were a couple of my Muslim friends. A group of people from their Mosque took 2 days off work to help the affected people of whom, I'd guess, 95% were Christian.

That said, the actions of, and polls from, the Muslims who are currently being imported into the west by the hundreds of thousands indicate a strong incompatibility between western culture and fundamental Islamic beliefs/values. Places in Europe that previously had negligible violent incidents are now experiencing a tremendous rise in such, and it is all perpetrated by, and directly correlates with, the recent influx of Islamic people and culture.

It is sad that when I look into the effects of the influx of Islamic values in the west I only find violence and despair - I have yet to see any positive effects of the integration of foreign Islamic culture. I want everybody to just get along. I might have negative opinions concerning Islam, but I don't want Muslims to suffer at all. I just want the conflicting culture of Islam, and the violence that the Quran dictates, to be localized to Islamic countries.

In short, people of western culture are being viciously assaulted by people who adhere to the words and culture of Islam. The victims wouldn't be such if not for the influence of Islam. I don't see any positive effects coming from integrating the "real" Muslims into western culture - I only see suffering. Suffering that is encouraged by the definitive holy teachings of Islam.

You made a point in one of your comments previous about "real" Muslims/Christians/etc. versus those who don't follow the exact word of their holy, foundational scriptures. In my opinion, people who don't adhere to the exact words of their fundamental religious texts aren't truly Muslim/Christian/Jewish (to include all the Abrahamic religions). To cherry pick the convenient/agreeable parts of religious text that fundamentally defines the religion is, in my opinion, questioning the authenticity of the God/Allah/Yahweh, which unravels the entire purpose of worshiping an almighty deity in the first place.

As for you personally, your beliefs aside, I hope you have a great weekend.</div>

    <div class="md">Worldwide, almost every day, innocent people are being killed in the name of Islam. This isn't happening in anywhere near the same order of magnitude within any other religious context. All religions are fairy tales regardless - it's just a fucking shame that this most awful one results in so many innocents being assaulted, raped, tortured, and killed.

Every muslim I've personally known has been GREAT. I'm sure you are great too.

Islam is fucking cancer.</div>

    <div class="md">The key passage that follows the "fight the infidels" line that many often ignore or don't know it exists says, 'If any of the unbelievers asks you for sanctuary, then take them into your houses so that they might hear the word of God and then let them go on their way,". All known accounts and records of Aisha's age at marriage, estimates of her age range from nine to 19. Secondly, in seventh-century, adulthood was defined as the onset of puberty. There are much evidences which demonstrate that girls were allowed to be married at the age of 10 years old and sometimes times, as young as 7 years old, legally. It was the norm. </div>

    <div class="md">How the fuck would you know this? Where did I say anything about terrorism? But ok, lets talk about that, If the only thing stopping someone from killing innocent civilians is ignorance to whether or not a terrorist knows or doesn't know Mohammed was a pedophile then they are a psychopaths and no amount of appeasement will lessen the likelihood of them becoming terrorists, so fuck em. Im done with the childrens games. Islam is cancer to the human race, if it tries to spread in the US it will be eradicated. </div>

    <div class="md">First off, taking all known accounts and records of Aisha's age at marriage, estimates of her age range from nine to 19. Secondly, in seventh-century, adulthood was defined as the onset of puberty. There are much evidences which demonstrate that girls were allowed to be married at the age of 10 years old and sometimes times, as young as 7 years old, legally. It was the norm. See you're spreading misinformation and spreading hate much like actual terrorist do. </div>

    <div class="md">The gods in every book aren't real, they are the way in which the human race understood unexplainable phenomenom of the time and they are an attempt to explain the human conscience (ability to discern right from wrong). Jesus and Mohammed on the otherhand were real people. One taught kindness and carpentry, the other taught submission and pedophilia. Why you change the subject?  
  
Imo god is the human conscience, and its what god has always been. The god of the new testament Bible was an attempt to explain the human conscience of a selfless man, Jesus Christ, the god of the old testament was an attempt to explain the human conscience (as well as unnatural phenomenom) of a everyday man, Moses, a harsh ruler, Abraham, a jealous man, Isacc etc.. (if Abraham and Isaac existed), the god of the quran (allah) was an attempt to explain the human conscience of a sociopathic scumbag, Mohammed. Evidenced by the fact the new testament god is loving and caring, which matches what jesus must have thought about right and wrong (his conscience). The old testament god is all over the place, sometimes frightning (abrahams god) which matches with abraham being a harsh but fair ruler, sometimes helpful (moses' god) which matches with moses being a normal dude placed in a tough situation so he strives to do the right thing, and sometimes spiteful (issacs god) which matches with Issac being jealous of his father (or whatever his story was im prolly mixing him up). The qurans god (allah) is a dominant petty god which matches with Mohamamed thinking he was better than everyone else (god complex is common with sociopaths) and probably used it to justify raping and punching a child. Fuck Islam, its cancer.</div>

    <div class="md">"Fuck islam is cancer" is not helping islam spread, its cutting directly to what it is, a corruption of the human soul through submission to a lunatics idea of god. You know what  actually is helping islam spread? Appeasement of islam, people see muslims get special treatment under the law it doesnt stop the spread of islam, it helps it. People think well if i convert to this religion im basically above the law so fuck it why not. Im so sick of this "dont offend tbem it only makes more of them" argument, never in human history has submission to a culture stopped the spread of that culture. So ima keep saying fuck islam, and that islam is cancer, and maybe people will research the religion to dispute me, which will just show them the truth, that islam really is a disease.</div>

    <div class="md">There are differences between Hadith and Quran. The Quran is:

The Words of God
Revealed in Arabic
In Rhythmical form

It's recitation is used in forms of worship such as salat
It's smallest chapter is a miracle in it of itself
Now there are two kinds of Ahadith,

Hadith Qudsi
Hadith Nabawi

Hadith Qudsi is:

The words of God in the words of the Prophet In Arabic

Hadith Nabawi is:

The words of the Prophet In Arabic
Gives us extra details about the forms of worship we are to do that is not in the Quran.

Wanna try that again?

    <div class="md">Mental gymnatics is attempting Christians are somehow more violent than Muslims over their holy texts. It's very clear which faith disregards violence and which does not. You cannot argue this given the numerous Islamic acts of conquest and violence in the past and present.</div>

    <div class="md">Analytical data is useless, New Testament has many claims that are not rosy but that refer specifically to the after life. Whereas Islam has many claims that would happen in the current life. Which is why muslims are more violent to begin with. Mohammed being a warlord and being an exemplary character for muslims probably doesn't help them be more peaceful.

Revelations (after life again) also probably spike the data by a lot.

Just because it seems complex and has a fancy name (analytical data) doesn't mean it adds value.

    <div class="md">You do realize that for a long time after adopting Islam, the Arab world was significantly more scientifically and technologically advanced than Christian Europe, right? It's pretty ignorant to pin down the reasons the Middle East is so fucked up today to "they're Muslim and we're not." It was at least partly caused by European colonization &amp; disruptive border creation, not to mention US intervention.

That being said, I definitely don't approve of the deletion of the negative quotes from the Qur'an and think that both it and the Bible are pretty problematic. I just also think that you shouldn't make sweeping generalizations of a region that ignore relevant historical context.</div>
