But for real, though, I am glad he made this announcement. I'm salty because he's a cowardly hypocrite who is perfectly fine with the censorship of other unsavory topics, but I believe this announcement is good. Maybe things will start to improve a little.</div>

I frequently severely criticize the way Reddit is run. But I am very heartened to see this response by Spez. 

I am as pro-science as it gets, yet I am permanently banned from numerous science-related subs for sharing high quality, highly reputable sources that contradict the popular notions on Reddit regarding COVID. I have been incredibly appalled by the anti-scientific, authoritarian, and corrupt behavior by a majority of redditors, including degree holders, science-based subs, and moderators of most subs. 

The widespread misinformation, censorship, manipulation, extremely biased coverage, hysteria, tribal mentalities &amp; behavior, politicization, unscientific attitudes and approaches, among laypeople, the media, and science-degree-holders. Much of it straight out of the books "Manufacturing Consent" and "1984", where the people I generally agree with politically were displaying horrifyingly anti-scientific attitudes (plus irrational, hysterical, etc.) while claiming to indisputably have the science on their side. Academics who should be entirely focused on what the data/evidence shows seemingly developed emotional, anti-scientific attitudes when it came to COVID-19. https://old.reddit.com/r/arizonapolitics/comments/iaswj7/im_finally_taking_the_time_to_do_a_full_write_up/

And that same group of people is now trying to get Reddit to silence the dissenters. Huge props to Spez for telling them to fuck off. 

From what I've seen, much of the misinformation around COVID on reddit comes from the fact that only hysteria was upvoted at the beginning, thus giving people a highly biased and erroneous coverage of COVID. The result is that people then downvote anything they see that's contradictory to the biased view that's been presented to them, exacerbating the problem even more. Then ignorant, unintelligent, anti-scientific, authoritarian mods contribute to the problem by removing and banning people who present heavily-cited contradictory views. But of course reddit refuses to do anything about corrupt mods. And in my opinion, that is one of the biggest problems with reddit, and one of the biggest contributors to this website no longer being a valid source of information. These types of issues have degraded Reddit to the point where there is little to no value to be found here. Reddit is now largely a cesspool of misinformation, idiocy, and heavily manipulated &amp; biased content. 

At its core, Reddit is flawed because individuals are flawed. 

I started following the New York Times in the past year. They publish both hysteria and criticism of the hysteria. Yet only the NYT articles promoting hysteria get upvoted on Reddit. The others get downvoted and removed. 

/r/futurology has historically been one of the better-moderated subs, and you can see that reflect in the fact that there are numerous rational, anti-censorship, dissenting comments, which in many/most other subs would result in downvotes, and removed &amp; banned by the mods https://web.archive.org/web/20210826061150/https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/pbittv/we_call_upon_reddit_to_take_action_against_the/ - https://archive.ph/wip/uWyR2</div>

    <div class="md">Spez and the other admins are in NO WAY our friends.

They have constantly and consistently quarantined or banned subs that bring solid, scientific proof and professional medical knowledge. 

If it goes against drug company or political agenda, the admins have no problem censoring it.

They're just jealous of this power and will not share it. It doesn't mean they're the good guys. The admins are just as bad, if not worse than, the power tripping, drug company shills that tried to extort them.</div>

    <div class="md">TBH, getting any vaccine involves a risk in protecting yourself as well as people who cannot get a vaccine for health reasons. Therefore, the stance of being a freerider rather than gave some guts to take the vaccine is the root of the problem. Freeriders get the same herd immunity protections as ones with health conditions that can't take the risk, while having no risk associated with the rare vaccine complications. However, in the discourse about it, there's basically no honesty whatsoever on any side of it.</div>
