    <div class="md">Just looked at some of the removed comments, especially all the ones at the very bottom of the page. These mods are disgusting. It's very possible he was the victim here, yet they want to bury it. But everyone was all for pushing this to the top when they thought she was the victim. Disgusting. It shouldn't matter whether it was a guy or a girl. Anyone who is a victim of domestic abuse should not see their story covered up.

Here's some comments that the /r/OutOfTheLoop mods wanted to keep you from seeing:

&gt;This is why I hate contemporary social media mob justice. It seems like people feel a need to take a strong stance on every little thing just so they can feel like they're on the "right side of history".
&gt;'Believe victims' was well-intentioned (getting people to not automatically dismiss allegations and accusing alleged victims of trying to stir up drama) but people have taken it as a license to mass-harass and ostracize the alleged perpetrator based on hearsay alone. That isn't social justice, that is the same kind of zealotry that we find in the Spanish Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, and the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic of the 80s and 90s.
The slogan should be taken as "Take allegations seriously and suspend judgment"  
  
_

&gt;If that is true, it is fucked up. It's disgusting when people fabricate stories of abuse. It hurts innocent people and helps undermine legitimate cases of abuse.

_

&gt;It's these kinds of cases that do the most harm to causes. It gives ammunition to the hateful and ignorant and it gives pause to those who would support the ones that need it.
