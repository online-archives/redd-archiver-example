    <div class="md">The headline was:

&gt;7-year-old migrant girl taken into Border Patrol custody dies of dehydration, exhaustion

Doesn't that make it seem like the border patrol agents starved a 7 year old girl? Misleading headlines is against the rules on most subs, but when it pushes the agenda that the /r/politics mods want to push, it's ok to ignore the rule. Here's the comment that the mods censored away since it, you know, may have clued people in to the fact that the headline is super misleading:

&gt;&gt;According to CBP records, the girl and her father were taken into custody at around 10 p.m. on Dec. 6 south of Lordsburg, N.M., as part of a group of 163 people who approached U.S. agents to turn themselves in.

&gt;&gt;More than eight hours later, the child began having seizures at 6:25 a.m., CBP records show. Emergency responders who arrived soon after measured her body temperature at 105.7 degrees, and according to a statement from CBP, she “reportedly had not eaten or consumed water for several days.”

Yep, they censored a comment that was 100% a quote of the article itself. Disgusting. A 7 year old girl died but if they can push an agenda they're more than happy to use a poor 7 year old girl to do it. Here are some other comments that apparently didn't follow the agenda:

&gt;“We call for a rigorous investigation into how this tragedy happened and serious reforms to prevent future deaths”

&gt;How about we stop blaming border control and start blaming that selfish father for forcing his sick child to cross the border illegally. He was dehydrating his kid before they even got into custody, then the kid dies. It’s tragic, but is it not mostly the father’s fault? I think medical attention should have been provided, but the border controls job is to organize and deport these people. The father knew what he was getting into, and he killed his kid in the process. Think about it, would you put your kid through this? Would you dehydrate them, just to try an illegally come to America, possibly to be deported back to where you came from? It’s hard work for nothing. Instead of doing this he should be staying home taking care of his family, and trying to get a job. His daughter would be alive.

... 

&gt;That is inhumane af.

&gt;We soldiers gave food an water to Iraqi detainees we captured right after they fucking shot at us.

&gt;Goddamnit.

... 

&gt;This girl died after just 8 hours in CBP custody, that means her father did not ensure she had water while he force marched her across the fucking desert and you dont find him at fault? Not even one bit?

&gt;God you people are so thick and blinded by politics you cant even let yourself come to very basic logical conclusions.


There's plenty more that was censored away in the thread. I'm at work so can't really go grab it all. The thread takes a while to load since there are so many comments.


BTW I accidentally posted this to /r/politics first. I'm on my phone so it's annoying to compile all this. Whoops. It should come as no surprise though that I have been banned from /r/politics http://magaimg.net/img/6v6w.jpg </div>
