    <div class="md">Here's the specific comment that was cited for me being banned:

"Holy shit this is fucking ridiculous. He could not be more reasonable and civil in his argument and you're acting like a child. I can't believe they let moderators act like this. This is so disheartening for this sub."

And rule 10 is what I broke which is "threatening, harassing, or attacking the users or mods of this sub"

I replied asking what the difference between "attacking" and debate/concern/discussion was and got a reply saying "it's over and done with now." What's even more funny is the mods are more in violation of this rule than I am.

Instead of addressing any of our points, the mods attack us personally by assuming we have nefarious intentions and are just trolls trying to hurt their sub for no reason. They are acting like children that do not tolerate any other opinion. /u/flytape even said "You're not welcome to keep stirring drama here because of opinions you don't like." And replies to other concern with "You're a 1 month old account complaining about a mod. Go away."

I only care about this sub and want to see it flourish and its mods be filled with integrity. I only wish to help this sub and I do not want to see it harmed or damaged, but I would like to hold these mods accountable for their actions, and we need to voice our concerns over this issue even though they will try to silence it.

Edit: since posting this, the mods have silenced me from messaging them for 72 hrs. Kind of odd since I haven't even messaged them. Seems like they are afraid of what I may say and what the other mods may see.</div>

It's still pretty small but I prefer it to r/conspiracy. Since this past election, it was starting to look way too much like the Trump subreddit. Seems the front page is filled with the same things, and not the fringe alien and reptilian conspiracies I find interesting.  </div>

    <div class="md">Thanks for the shout out! We're not pulling shenanigans like the submission OP is describing (and like other examples that are pretty much everywhere). They keep attempting to play victim while evidence to the contrary is abundant. If things go as planned down the line, we're gonna have bots run the CII sub and eliminate mod involvement as much as possible. The parameters will be publicly available at all times; any changes made will be submitted to the users like a software update is. It's time to get with the times. Mods do more harm than good around here anymore, and the subject of this thread is a perfect example of that...*as usual.*

We'll undoubtedly make mistakes as well, as these can be unruly and fickle communities, but nothing like the generic Walmart leadership over there. It's partly why I seek out threads like these. What they do, we don't. Where they repeatedly fail, we will not--and so on. Everything either is, or will be different. A constantly evolving space that's not mired in old thought, controversy, low standards, lack of action, bureaucracy, bias, self-preservation and ego. These are unique times and we most certainly aim to go big. I'll rent a damn billboard in NYC if I have to.

Omar comin'

&gt;Here's the specific comment that was cited for me being banned:
"Holy shit this is fucking ridiculous. He could not be more reasonable and civil in his argument and you're acting like a child. I can't believe they let moderators act like this. This is so disheartening for this sub."

Did you not read the comment you're replying to?

Did you even follow the link and read all of the replies? Because I doubt you did if you don't even know what I'm complaining about.</div>

    <div class="md">the comment was "CNN is ISIS", with the acronyms capitalized. the reason I point this out was because when another comment was posted saying "cnn is isis", it was accepted.

Apparently capitalizing acronyms is shouting in that sub.</div>

    <div class="md">This is one of the foremost reasons why I believe that users should consume moderator's work on per submission basis. Has one of the mods started deleting good content out of sudden? Unfollow. Poof and all his changes are reversed for me. Does my friend suggest different mod? Click follow.
