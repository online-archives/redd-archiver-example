    <div class="md">The arrogance of these mods is so insulting. Here's the comment the gracious mod left on the thread after locking it:

&gt;The comments have, shockingly, surprisingly, wow the mods were completely not expecting this, gone south. Locking.

It's borderline cringey behavior. What does he/she do in real life when things aren't going their way? Must be a real travesty for them.</div>

    <div class="md">I went on that thread before they locked it, it was just civil discussion.

But I guess because the entire comment section wasn't "mah wamen in games" they had to lock it.

    <div class="md">Yeah, I've personally watched both live GDQ events as well as archives on YouTube and there's loads of female runners. 

There is a small, toxic minority in the community, but that's all it is. A minority. 99% of the community doesn't care about your gender, just your times, and maybe your attitude if you're at GDQ.</div>

    <div class="md">idk about speedruns in particular, but playing games in general as a female (if its an open mic game, and I use mic) I get harassed a lot, it's not rare in the slightest. Again, I don't really watch speed runs (only sometimes with my friend who likes them) but, it's in the gaming community so I bet there is more sexism towards women than you expect.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Perceived barrier of entry. The community is heavily skewed male, so a female is facing the prospect of trying to break into a community that is "different" from her. And that can be a scary prospect, **especially with how horrible anonymous people on the internet can be towards females.**

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm do they not consider that there might be less women at their speedrunning events because — and I’m just throwing this out there — vastly fewer women are interested in playing decades old games as fast as they can...? I’d be shocked if even 3% of speedrunners are female, so it really shouldn’t be a surprise that there aren’t as many women at their events. 

No, it must be because of meanies on the internet. By the way, we really need to work on straight male representation in makeup tutorials. The YouTube makeup tutorial scene needs to be more inclusive of men. Also, the knitting community needs to 👏🏿 stop 👏🏿 being 👏🏿 so 👏🏿 sexist, because the fact that 50% of knitters aren’t male shows online trolls are keeping men from actively participating in the knitting/crocheting community.</div>

    <div class="md">? It's actually a valid point. Guessing you aren't a women so you don't realize the constant harassment or special treatment a girl playing games will get if they realize you're a girl, it's pretty annoying. And it's definitely off-putting.  


Right now there probably isn't a lot of speedrunners who are female, and probably a lot who aren't good enough or something (i dont watch speedruns) to actually get showcased at the main event. But by doing an all female event, it guarantees a lot of these female speedrunners a chance to get showcased and therefor show that there are a decent amount of females into speedrunning, and then showing that might help make more women speedrunners so one day the main event could be more equal.</div>

    <div class="md">Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:  
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word".

And your fucking delete function doesn't work. You're useless.

Have a nice day!

    <div class="md">Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:
I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,
and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at
someone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics)

I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.

Have a nice day!</div>
