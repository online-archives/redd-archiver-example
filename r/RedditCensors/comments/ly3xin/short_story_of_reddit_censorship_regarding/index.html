    <div class="md">Hoooly crap youre a moron. Did you even read the article you linked in that post? or just read the title and assumed that "where did the money go" meant the money just disappeared and must have ended up in a private account of some democrats who concocted the whole thing as some conspiracy to rip off black people?

If you honestly claim that your first post wasnt inflammatory as fuck and you were banned because of some censorship agenda, you're either unbelievably brainwashed or just delusional.

people like you are exactly why no one takes this "reddit censors" crap seriously. Does reddit actively censor? Maybe. Does reddit have an agenda? Probably. Do some moderators/subs go batshit with power? Most definitely. But when people like you literally break the rules of a sub and then go "reeeee" blaming it on a democrat conspiracy, everyone just tunes you out eventually.</div>

    <div class="md">You guys need just like one credible journalist or someone authoritative enough to make the rest of us not think you're out of your mind at a glance if you want to continue this. Mogulist. Com not going to do it I'm afraid...

It should be easy -- plenty of people are freelance and have credible backgrounds. Most journalist are opportunists so if there's some truth you'd think someone at least semi credible would want to make their name on it. See things like war atrocities in vietnam by us soldiers -- they caught a lot of flack for writing that but did it because it was the truth and would enhance their career.  

The other thing that gives you away to people not a part of your conspiracy is the pseudo racist dog whistle language you use -- plantation isn't in the common tongue, especially not how you're using it. The way you use it is overtly a signal to others about your stance and gives you away that your motives aren't really or aren't just to share information you think is important and hidden. 

I guess my point is if you really believe all this stuff, there's so much more you could be doing to actually attempt to woo others instead of just self aggrandizing and creating situations where you can claim some victimhood. The fact that you and a lot like you do not, suggests you're not genuine whatsoever.</div>
