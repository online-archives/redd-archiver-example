    <div class="md">Mccarthy did nothing wrong. The media and Hollywood are the ones who went wild with accusations, not surprisingly as we later discover because they are filled with sensationalists and Marxists themselves.   
Of the people Mccarthy had accused, over 90% were found guilty and were fired or "resigned". They were only accusing people within the government, not private citizens. And with evidence, as it was bore out.  

*Patton* though, should have finished the job against the commies.</div>

I’ve read posts on r/worldnews that advocated for the killing of Americans who don’t “think a certain way and who are enemies of ‘progressivism.’” I’ve read posts on r/news that describe how supporters of the 2nd Amendment should be thrown into prison and forced to watch as “their precious guns are destroyed in front of them.” I’ve read posts in r/banned from the_Donald, r/atheist and r/sanders for president that conservatives and “backwards, Christian “assholes” should be forced into prison, have their constitutional rights taken from them and arrested if attending a Trump rally.</div>

Not openly. But yes there are places where Islamic violence is encouraged and celebrated.

In these places I attest and challenge, "are there not 10,000 names for God and tens of that number ways to worship?" Inshallah. The religion of space will be a blend of us all.</div>

    <div class="md">Why are we advocating for more censorship? Yes it's hypocrisy but you're advocating for admins to have more power, something they clearly can't be trusted with. Common carrier. It's our voices that make reddit what it is. Leave our voices alone. No censorship ever.</div>

    <div class="md">This isn't advocating censorship.  Censorship is the opposite of sharing knowledge.  Reddit has chosen to censor wrongthink.  They have shown that agents provocateur can be used to eliminate any group they disagree with, and this information shows that they are selective about their censorship.  Reddit admins have an agenda they are playing out and won't be swayed by this info - they have chosen censorship and that is a slippery slope with only one likely outcome.  But educated users can at least see what they are doing when armed with knowledge.

When someone is pointing out hypocrisy, don't immediately assume the person pointing it out is advocating more bad behavior.   That is almost never the case!</div>

    <div class="md">I actually want less censorship, but.... if we threaten the pedophilia subreddits AHS and TMOR scurry and hide their hentai stashes while the super mods back up their child porn allowing for a brief window where actual moderation can be discussed.

It's a very brief window. Filled with peril. Possible banishment. And not a donut or tendie in sight.</div>

    <div class="md">The owners of reddit want to make money. As much money as possible as efficiently as possible. They see pandering the left as a more lucrative market to exploit than giving an equally open platform to all views on the political spectrum. They overwhelmingly support leftist politicians [(link)](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/totals.php?id=D000041920&amp;cycle=2014) despite having a tradition of avoiding taxes with the best of 'em [(link)](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/business/newhouse-s-private-empire.html) which is distinctly un-leftist behaviour. As the magazine business dies [(link)](https://www.foliomag.com/conde-nast-paradise-publishing-lost/) they are trying to figure out how to get more money out of reddit, because it's clear that online is the future and very soon print will be dead. Therefore principles (Freedom of Expression) go out the window in favor of expediency (Get the money!) because all business only cares about short term profits now. In the case of reddit, Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc, they are all existing on borrowed time, as the narrative about "influence" makes it more and more likely that Section 230 will be removed from law because politicians want to control the flow of information. [(link)](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/social-media-platforms-or-publishers-rethinking-section-230/)

As has always been the case since the days of Lenin, the Left is its own worst enemy. Sadly, their learning experiences make life harder for everyone.</div>
