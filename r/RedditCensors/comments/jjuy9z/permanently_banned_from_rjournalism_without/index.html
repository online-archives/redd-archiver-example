Edit: A mod finally replied to me and said my posts constitute both griefing and canvassing and then muted me so that I could not reply/defend myself. My posts aren't canvassing, nor neither are they griefing. Can I claim the same about the mod for posting Facebook or corporate MSM friendly articles? Come on. Shameful moderation.</div>

    <div class="md">...

You posted a tweet from Glen Greenwald where he attacks the left by saying, “ Most liberal-left outlets are too scared, too censorious, or too devoted to abusing their function to help Biden win to publish one of the most accomplished and honest journalists in the country, 
@mtaibbi”

Do you honestly think that the leftists that run that sub did some sort of thorough investigation of your past, and went, “oh, wait, guise... false alarm.  This guy is actually one of us”?

No.  They saw you posted something that spoke ill of the left, and BAN.

That’s just how it works.  Spend some more time on this sub, and maybe you’ll start to get it.

Don’t shoot the messenger.</div>

    <div class="md">Not that I disagree with you but I didn't think that sub was the type to ban people for posting content that was critical of media, left or not. Like I said, I had posted stuff related to Greenwald and Assange before and I wasn't banned for it then or told it was not okay. I have also spent time in a number of threads where I've found myself needing to explain my political leaning after being accused of being a Trump supporter or Russian troll. In the end though, they of course don't believe me or they stick to their guns at least that I am a useful idiot who spreads disinformation. I do believe those particular people are hopeless and a disgrace to their progression. I mean the mod who perma banned me is also a disgrace in my personal opinion. I mod a sub and I don't remove people for differences of opinion. If they break the rules, they would not get a perma ban unless it was something serious like threatening violence or being racist etc</div>

    <div class="md">No offense but that’s all democrats nowadays.  

The “good” ones who still adhere to Classical liberalism (aka no IDpol bullshit), they’ve all fled to independents or are reluctantly (and in many cases enthusiastically) voting for Trump.

There is no other choice.  The Democrat party has lost their minds embracing that authoritarian anti American censorship you just felt.

    <div class="md">No offense taken and yeah I see a lot of left-wing subs appear to have been taken over/manipulated by efforts out the corporate-center and they got casuals and idpol wrapped around their fingers (and so tribalized and blindly obedient) attacking not just the right and independents but alsk progressives who dare criticize dem party/leadership. Combine that with McCarthyism, group think and vote manipulation, and what a terrible recipe for healthy discourse.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;It looks like you mostly just reposted Glenn Greenwalds tweets

Not exactly true but it *is* mostly related to Greenwald and Assange, as I said and that isn't against the rules.


&gt;and almost everything you've recently posted there is some sort of greifing. Rule 3 in /r/Journalism

That's not true. Where did I grief? Please link to it because I don't recall ever griefing anyone. I remember responding to people who were attacking me for posting this content or Greenwald etc - both of which is against the rules. 

Edit: Do you think those people got banned for attacking journalists and users? For being uncivil? I doubt it. They likely reported me and the content I was posting to get me and it removed. I mean these users also post false and misleading info (some of which appears to be copypasta) but I don't know that *that* breaks the rules, but the aformentioned behavior and rule breaking is pretty blatant, but mods never seemed to do anything about that. You can go and look through each comment thread of each post I made there and it will corroborate whalt I've said above. The worst thing I ever did there was criticize MSM, as far as my rule breaking goes and I want even aware I couldn't do that at the time.</div>

    <div class="md">You weren't doing the complaining, you just posted other people's complaints. The Greenwald tweets were all greifing, and that's probably why those posts got reported.  I'm not saying what the rules should be in any given sub,  I am just explaining what I could see as how the sub might apply their rules.  Just posting a bunch of stuff about complaints about MSM, that could absolutely be seen as greifing.</div>

    <div class="md">Alright but that's totally subjective. Like I don't think Greenwald was griefing or intending to grief. I think he had valid points - points which were corroborated by evidence and supported by other journalists. Of course people in those threads would still claim that Greenwald was lying and spreading disinformation, but it looks to me like he wasn't and I'd argue that it's the users trying to discredit him, who are posting the misinfo/disinfo.</div>
