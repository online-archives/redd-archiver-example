    <div class="md">There is zero reason to think Trump doesn't care. He's reacted to this disaster faster than any other world leader. Wishing death on him, for protecting people the whole time is deranged. The Dems are the ones fighting against any attempts to combat the Wuhan Flu.

No 2 million people died, or are going to die, because of Trump. Quite the opposite. He's saved countless lives because of his fast and  decicive actions. (Dems screaming bloody murder at every step too). 

95% of world-wide infections and deaths are the fault of the communist Chinese government, and their lap-dogs the WHO. And you're not allowed to post about how you want them to die either, though they absolutely should be brought to *justice*. 

You absolutely wished death on an innocent man, and are completely ignoring the REAL perpetrators of this  entire mess. The CCP has blood on their hands. Lay the blame where it belongs, and don't promote death on innocent people because of some ridiculous political indoctrination. 

Please, turn CNN off and your brain on.</div>

    <div class="md">Same damn thing. You wished death on an  innocent person. One that's doing his best to help you actually.

The context is Orange Man Bad derangement, zero reason behind it.

The ban is because you actually posted a death wish on someone. Your pitiful excuse is pitiful. Semantics doesn't change the fact you posted that you wish the president of the USA (or anyone) were dead.   

Also, saying Trump is responsible for deaths is completely deranged. You're talking about the communist Chinese government, and their lap-dog the WHO.</div>
