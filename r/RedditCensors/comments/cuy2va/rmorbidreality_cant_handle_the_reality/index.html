      <div class="md">Found out I couldn't reply, so ended up stuck in [a thread like this](https://www.removeddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/cuo1qi/the_last_picture_of_coach_dave_williams_warning/exyz8gp/?st=jzpvqwtx&amp;sh=f3d86b1c), where I couldn't reply anymore to slandering accusations towards me.

[I think this is the part that triggered them](https://www.removeddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/cuo1qi/the_last_picture_of_coach_dave_williams_warning/ey05c5c/):

&gt; And you know the thing about multiculturalism is true: it's also the reason for African wars are the messed up borders the few European countries had going on during their colonial phases. That ended up with people in Africa with countries not resembling their cultures / having countries with all kinds of mixed up cultures. The result is wars, that are still going on, trying to fix the borders to match the culture.

&gt; The same happened within Europe as well, you know there used to be plenty of wars between nations here until borders settled at roughly the cultural borders. Then we had a long prosperous period of peace until the divisive bullshit from rich spoiled elite people wanting to feel good about themselves started glorifying multiculturalism.


Next, I asked the moderators what it was about, and then they came up with some shitty excuses of why they've configured their Automoderator like that, banned me proper for 14 days and muted me for 72 hours. It's as if there are children moderating the subs.

Edit: changed links to removeddit

Edit 2: they unremoved the other comment, maybe in response to this, so I removed it here.</div>

    <div class="md">Simultaneously they do acknowledge the issue of multiculturalism by acknowledging the wars in Africa are because of multiculturalism (by colonialists messing up their cultural borders). They also acknowledge wars in Europe were because of mismatching cultural vs national borders.

Yet somehow lefties believe (I seriously doubt they *think* about these things) multiculturalism leads to peace, against all the evidence present.

The only reason they believe so is because Soviet propaganda that was implanted in hippies and 3rd wave radical feminists among other leftie groups has evil motives and was designed to corrupt the west (enemies of the Soviets) from the inside. They've then spread this bullshit in mostly humanist academic circles and now social media from generation to generation.

The old propaganda works well, but serves no purpose anymore, so the lefties are destroying our societies and cultures for the benefit of no-one.</div>

    <div class="md">First off, we we nothing but polite and courteous to you. You came into the modmail literally demanding an explanation. A mod explained that the automod is configured to remove posts that use certain language- racial slurs, insults, and commonly used spam phrases.

Then due to your failed understanding of how the automod feature works thought you were still being targeted so you came in here to try to stir up drama. The automod filters things out. Once it has removed a post, you editing the offending word out isn’t going to automatically put it back up. You would have to let us know so we can over ride the bot. 

Rather than discuss things politely in the modmail, you continued to accuse us of having some sinister agenda to keep you silenced. You were banned and muted for being rude and disrespectful.</div>

Nope, that's bullshit. I messaged you, you didn't answer until I created another post on r/WatchRedditDie.

Then you banned and muted me, then I created this post since I no longer had a channel to communicate the issue.

Fuck being respectful, if *I have low expectations* is that, which you proved true by banning and muting.

Also, I know well how Automoderator works, I've configured several instances of it myself.

&gt; racial slurs, insults, and commonly used spam phrases

Which you failed to identify and of some of which I suspect were quoted from the parent message I replied to, which had words such as "idiot" and general slandering against me. One word you did name from the other message under genital mutiliation post was "masturbation" as-in motive for genital mutiliation was about "making masturbation more difficult". This all seems like you have young children doing the moderation if you find these words insulting, racial slurs and commonly used spam phrases. I'd not even be surprised, since it's turned out many of these overly sensitive bullshit moderation practices are in fact done literally by children, including in NSFW subs that are supposedly for adults only.

&gt; First off, we we nothing but polite and courteous to you

LOL, do you want me to post the exchange of that as well?</div>
