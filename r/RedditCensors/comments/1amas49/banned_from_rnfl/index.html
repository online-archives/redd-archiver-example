    <div class="md">I never said that was the problem, you jumped to that likely to frame this as some sort of racist issue. In reality though the DEI program is a race based program, my issue with DEI has nothing to do with race, rather, that it's an ineffective program.

All I know is that I think almost everyone would agree that if they had a doctor that was going to perform a surgery, or a pilot, or some sort of person who is doing something that could realistically result in *your* death, as in it directly impacts your personal life. That *you* would want the most qualified candidate whether that person is black, brown, white, red or purple.

My problem with DEI is that it does nothing to actually increase the talent of the person that is being hired, and doesn't really fix any problems and that the real issue is that a lot of impoverished (not black, not asian, not white, but impoverished) communities don't have access to the same level of education, job opportunity, etc. that other communities have that produce qualified candidates. Just giving someone a job as a diversity hire doesn't help that person at all or the company they were hired to. And this is coming from someone who believes there are disadvantaged communities in this country. We could go back and forth for hours on why that is. Point being. DEI isn't effective as it doesn't correct the root cause of the problem and likely does more harm than good to everyone.

As to your point on Union jobs, I wish I knew more about it, but I trust that there is merit to your claim and it's likely that all of these problems combine to make a bigger problem.</div>

    <div class="md">All right, so you're an idiot then, who puts words in other people's mouths in order to win arguments, and tries to frame every discusion as racist/homophobic/xenophobic/etc. 

Because, and you haven't really provided any substance to go off of, I doubt the merits of whatever argument you might be able to provide are lacking. So you use the old tried and true. 

I'll keep talking about this with other people who want to have an honest conversation about fixing these problems, there's more and more of them everyday, but not with you.

Did you catch that undercurrent? 🤣</div>

    <div class="md">You're just a racist liberal who believes anyone who doesn't think just like you is the issue. People like you will never admit that hiring practices based on d&I and not skill hurts every group of color. Indians have the highest percentage of college education citizens, but they may not get a job in America because of d&I. The job may go to the less qualified  candidates that fit the diversity the company needs or wants.

    <div class="md">Not what DEI nor D&I is.

What has it hurt? Who are you claiming did D&I in that way? Because within DEI there _are_ implementation decisions, that can be different at every organization or department, and if you had some person who knew as much about it as you seem to, then yes it will make the issues worse

Very similar to republicans getting into government, they tell you government won't work, they get elected in, then they _prove_ government (run by them) does not work

Y'all sound like you heard the stories about affirmative action, then you've never learned anything else about the subject in the last 20-30 years. The original politically incorrect show railed on about these exact same talking points. The mischaracterization worked once, why wouldn't it work again, not like anyone will look into the real differences between the ideas...</div>

    <div class="md">The problem is the racist dip shits above you. 

Air traffic is massively subsidized by the federal government.  No incentive to make the industry better from within.

It's still a capitalist enterprise so any time there's a dip in profits they start cutting.  Before covid tanked their industry, safety issues were already a problem.  So you think, unlike every other capitalist enterprise, when they started cutting service they kept up the same safety standards?  

Any reason to blame minorities and women.  Keep them out!  Only white men can fly planes is the unstated statement.

Fargo had a conversation that seems to fit here:

"(They say)...to jip (as in gypsy) or jew...as if stealing was a part of a mans nature" Munch

That's the two pukes above you whinnying about the inclusion of historically excluded groups in the airline industry.</div>

    <div class="md">So I never mentioned race you did if d&I means race to you than you're the racist. Why am I racist because hiring someone because of color instead of on skill results in issues?  in fact, hiring based just on color was called racism until it favored certain groups over others.

    <div class="md">How often can you prove the reason they got the job was solely because of their race though? Imagine all the work and effort you put into the subject being completely dismissed because you got a job as a black person instead of a white person getting the job. When you call someone a diversity hire you aren't saying "they aren't the best for the job" you're saying "the reason you have that job is because you're a minority" and that's fucked because it discounts the person entirely as if white people don't also lack skills and are rejected on that basis</div>

    <div class="md">Oh I agree with you that cost cutting measures done by companies can often times result in decreased quality of output, but I wasn't talking about that or about Boeing.  I was just pointing out that hiring someone based on anything but their ability to do the job will result in less effective employees and decreased output.  Race, gender, sexual orientation, etc shouldn't even be a factor in the hiring process.

And how about we not demean people with disabilities.</div>

    <div class="md">Why is more diverse = not as skilled though? If a black person gets hired over a white person why is the reasoning immediately "it's cuz they're black" and not "they were more skilled"? You can look at performance over time and say "well the stats show that the quality is going downhill" but the only way you'd know that's due to forcing diversity over skill is by knowing who all the other applicants were at the time</div>

    <div class="md">>Why is more diverse = not as skilled though?

It's not.  If a company takes the best candidates and that group just happens to be diverse, that still means they picked the best possible people to do the job.  If at any time during the hiring process they prioritize or include diversity over skill level, then they will have less capable employees than if they had just focused on skill alone.  Race, gender, sexual orientation etc should never even be considered when hiring people or selecting who gets into a college.</div>

    <div class="md">He only did partial measures and much of the growth that did occur was based off policies of his predecessors.  While more people were technically employed there was a boom in population so the per capita it wasn’t the great improvement Pence claimed. [extra sourcing - 4. Pence also claimed, "there’s more Hoosiers going to work than ever before."  Verify: That’s an overstatement.  We looked into this claim Tuesday night when Indiana's Lt. Governor Eric Holcomb made a similar statement during his GOP convention speech. It’s true the raw number of workers is at an all-time high, but that’s due to population growth.  The percentage of Hoosiers with jobs is not a record. The current unemployment rate is 5 percent in Indiana. The record best was 2.9 percent in October 2000.](https://www.kare11.com/amp/article/news/politics/national-politics/verify-indianas-economy-under-mike-pences-leadership/89-278582029)

Indiana’s road infrastructure was  a total mess under Pence - severely depleting state reserves and borrowing money after a major bridge on I65 caused a month long closure as emergency repairs were needed. [More on the I-69 mess](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2017/06/18/mike-pence-donald-trump-public-private-partnerships-mitch-daniels-interstate-69-isolux-bloomington/388756001/)

His big education funding actually accounted for less money than average as it was only 2.3% increase when the state had been averaging a 2.7% spending increase on education.

    <div class="md">Expecting humans to be rational actors is a poor public health policy model and a poor business model.  That cost the state about a million dollars per patient to support plus other costs for the roughly 25 year life expectancy of HIV patients [and cost the state over $160 million in medical fees that could have been avoided with a timely and effective response.](https://www.wthr.com/amp/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/inside-epidemic-hiv-outbreak-brings-massive-cost/531-bb6811b6-9d9b-4e5c-b428-0b3fd737dba6)

So basically Pence fucked the tax payers of Indiana and made them foot the bill for his religious extremism 

Also, your position on this crisis is ghoulish morally and one of the dumbest fucking health care and economic positions to take.</div>

    <div class="md">It can be argued that she slept her way into a position of authority in State gov.  Fucked over some prisoners to keep cheap firefighter.  Then got elected to Senate.  Then got a VP nomination because Biden needed a black woman.  I don't see that she's more qualified than Pence, who was a state governor.  I really don't see anything that she's done that would cause me to believe that she would do well as pres.</div>

    <div class="md">Also, can I say this my high school girlfriend was Spanish. The girl I dated 2 of the 3 years of school was half African American, The woman I almost married was black and my wife is mexican, so when you say I'm racist I have to laugh. 
    I do not think i should have to detail my private life to show you I'm far from being a bigot or racist but reddit always believes that if someone doesn't think like me, they are racist. In my face, I would have an African American wife right now if the world didn't decide her life was going to be cut short. 
  I take offense to the fact that you group me as a racist because I'm smart enough to see the issue with d&I hiring I'm some fields of work. Clearly, you're racist and you must not really realize how racist you are. You assumed I'm white and would never care about people of color when my whole life I've spent loving or falling in love not based on color but on who the person is.</div>

    <div class="md">Well im not arguing in favor or aginst it in this conversation nor do i think i fully understand or could articulate my perspective but thats not what im asking. What im intrested in is the first post i responded to says something like " sowell is racist because internalized racism?(a guess)". And when i asked for an example you implied with that quote that he would prefer to go back to slavery. Which seems insane. Now if he has defended jim crow thats interesting and il be curious to look into it more. My sense of what he believe is that the black community has been and continues to be dupped by a political party to promises a lot but delivers very little. And it just seems really disingenuous to write off black conservatives and the use nasty actually racist terms against them like uncle tom.</div>

    <div class="md">You’re missing that White Supremaists don’t want equity because it challenges White people, especially White men’s economic and political power as the system is artificially rigged to ensure they are the dominant political and economic group in America. 

Capitalists don’t want equity because then they would lose the ability to engage in wage theft and exploit people for their labor. The American Capitalist economy has been built on the exploitation of Black Americans and immigrants. If we had equity measures and were able to  affect change then companies would have to pay better and cut into profits for shareholders</div>

    <div class="md">No one is saying Revolution, you can have capitalism that is less exploitative, like stakeholder capitalism you see via the Nordic Model and the other Western European versions.

 You get we provide very cushy socialist policies to the Capitalist class via subsides and bailouts, right? 

[Whenever the government provides opportunities in privileges for white people and rich people they call it “subsidized” when they do it for Negro and poor people they call it “welfare.” The fact that is the everybody in this country lives on welfare. Suburbia was built with federally subsidized credit. And highways that take our white brothers out to the suburbs were built with federally subsidized money to the tune of 90 percent. Everybody is on welfare in this country.](https://cityobservatory.org/dr-king-socialism-for-the-rich-and-rugged-free-enterprise-capitalism-for-the-poor/)

[The problem is that we all to often have socialism for the rich and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor. That’s the problem.](https://cityobservatory.org/dr-king-socialism-for-the-rich-and-rugged-free-enterprise-capitalism-for-the-poor/)

    <div class="md">Actually read Sowell, he makes the bootstraps argument and literally blames Black people for struggling to overcome systemic racism

Even amongst scholars with a more Centrist or Conservative position see his bootstraps argument as foolish as it ignores systemic racism and makes a genetic and cultural flaw argument saying Black people are inept and incapable of bettering themselves and essentially should be where they are since they essentially allowed themselves to be inferior. You know real self hate bullshit

[Sowell seems to assert that slavery and its lingering effects have no impact on the current destructive acts or sensibilities of African Americans.](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/21122/white-supremacy-vs-negro-ineptitude-sowells-myths-of-economic-inequality)

[does not address specific times that the U.S. government explicitly took or stole wealth from African Americans, such as the U.S. government taking Frederick Douglass’ contribution to the Freedmen Bank, then closing the bank and never returning Douglass’ funds or the funds of other contributors. Nor did they redirect those seized funds into other efforts to aid newly freed African Americans. The same can be said of the destruction of Black Wall Street in Tulsa.  So, yes—white supremacy only succeeds because of Negro ineptitude. But we cannot ignore the U.S. government’s rooted history of actively destroying or stealing Black wealth.   Thus, I’d like Thomas Sowell to be more balanced in his factual presentation of why African Americans continue to be second-class citizens. It’s a combination of white supremacy and Negro ineptitude. To highlight one without the other is unempirical and can be malicious](https://www.mississippifreepress.org/21122/white-supremacy-vs-negro-ineptitude-sowells-myths-of-economic-inequality)</div>

    <div class="md">Well, to start, equity, being equal outcome, has been the driver behind the most destructive social movements of the last century, killing hundreds of millions of innocent people.


Inclusion is simply not a virtue, and is the anthem of the underdeveloped narcissist. Normally, as adults mature, they realize that exclusion is the normal process of a healthy, functioning society. the creation of organizations focused on achieving mutual goals requires the exclusion of all others who do not share the goals or do not contribute towards its attainment.


Finally, diversity is divisive by nature. In fact, the word "diverse" itself comes from Latin "diversus" meaning "split apart" or "turned separate ways". If you want to go to NYC and I want to go to Chicago then we naturally will split. If you want to write everything in Python and I write everything in Rust then we're going to have problems. Consider this: let's say you disagree with me that diversity is divisive. In that case you and I are divided on the matter. Why are we divided on the matter? Because of the diversity of opinions among us. Simply having diversity inherently divides us. </div>

All equity means is realizing we all start at different spots and literally providing mostly children opportunities to have the opportunity to  all get a high quality education, get healthcare, and be able to eat. It’s literally the smartest way to organize because we maximize the ability of our human capital and then we truly let natural differences in skill and intellect lead toward the best  and most innovative minds running things. It’s literally saying we’ll give everyone a chance because it will maximize our collective strength.

Do you really think being an adult is living “Greek Life” into adulthood and living like we’re frat boys? We’re all interconnected my person.

    <div class="md">The black family survived centuries of slavery and generations of Jim Crow, but it has disintegrated in the wake of the liberals’ expansion of the welfare state.

Lavern literally destroyed families as people were stolen from their families in Africa to go to the Americas. Then if they found a partner their partner, themselves, or their kids could be - and regularly were - sold to other slave owners and separated. 

The children of raped slaves were not allowed to be with their fathers and mixed race kids were denied their claim to their father’s inheritance. 

Jim Crow created the school to prison pipeline via the 13th Amendment and re legalized slavery in the South — hence chain gangs. 

Separate but Equal allowed for states to steal money from HBCUS ([over half a billion dollars just in Tennessee alone](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/13/996617532/behind-the-underfunding-of-hbcus)aand underfund k-12 which has led to the socio economic conditions that have created the school to prison pipeline.</div>

    <div class="md">Internal memorandums detailed lowering the requirements and aptitude testing to ensure candidates could be eligible to be hired based solely on the diversification needs of the company. They lowered the standards to allow a larger candidate pool and then hired not on skill or how competent the person would be for the position  but based more on being able to hired based on gender ,race, or belief. Look, it's black and white before to become an air traffic controller. The person would have to go thru a rigorous application process, proving they could cope with the environment and would be competent in the position one allowed the applicant would start at lower, less populated airports. 
    Since the FAA  decided to start D&I hires, the test was changed and literally has questions that a 5th grade student would know and took any questions that could lower the candidate pool out. 
   What has been the result, a large increase in major runway incursions, increased collision alerts, and more pilot reported atc deviations. They explicitly stated that hiring and training a person will not necessarily bring that person up to the standards needed. You know, as well as I do, that not everyone can hold certain jobs not because of color or sexuality but because not everyone has the same level of mental competence. 
   As far as Boeing, they are finding out the same thing, and you can not train a person to hold a position that was hired based solely D&I and expect that person to perform as well as a person who has the knowledge and skill from previous work experience.  

   As a pilot I have seen multiple people who want to be a pilot but have to give up because the skills needed do not care about who you are flying a aircraft is a huge responsibility and not everyone can perform or gain the knowledge and skill needed . Now, are you telling me my company should hire a pilot based on the color of the skin, not how well they can perform well guess what? That's what they are tired of,and  they have since stopped the d&I hiring. Wonder why well the number of candidates that did not meet the requirements and the amount of money they spent trying was too costly and it's a very large, well-known domestic carrier. I've been told they even stopped ground crew D&I  hires because of the increase in safety violations and reported violations of company procedures. I'm not saying they fired or stopped hiring colored, Trans, or says they stopped hiring people who were clearly not qualified but was hired anyway</div>

    <div class="md">And I'm not saying they are lower quality. I'm saying that when you allow people to apply, that would not meet the standards to apply before they changed the requirements to allow for D&I hiring you get a pool of candidates that cost more for training and in the end the results speek for themselves. The color of your skin doesn't mean you can't perform as well as other colors there is no link saying that but picking employees based solely on D&I allows for people that may not be good enough for the job no matter the color of their skin or sexuality.</div>

    <div class="md">It's clear you're just too uneducated to see the point I am making.  Yes, they are lower quality because they would never have been qualified to hold that position until the qualifications were lowered to allow for a more diverse pool of candidates. That has nothing to do with race, sex or religion. It's like saying only people who went to college  and have a masters degree could apply for the Job before d&I. With the D&I now people with a high school equivalent could apply. Do you really think that's fair  plus now the company has to spend more money on training a person for a job they are not qualified to hold 10 years ago. Again, this is an example only, but people who are racist like you only jump to one conclusion. Try to find one company that started d&I for Blacks only, but in your mind, anyone who says d&I is bad for the company and the results speak for themselves is against blacks and racist. In fact, the colored people who actually have the education and knowledge and went to school are hurt just as much by d&I as everyone else</div>

Now I know they are more conservative personalities, but honestly, msnbc and CNN  will never cover this. I'm a pilot.

Watch the first video and tell me you truly don't believe this and don't just say it's not true because of the sources it's 2024 we all know new can not be trusted but the data doesn't lie

    <div class="md">It's funny  i should of commented what your response would havs been and i would have nailed it. data doesn't change no matter who is telling it to you. Your response is the typical woke reddit response. If CNN would actually report on it, then they could be used as a source. And do you actually think I'm going to share the email a major u.s airline sent about this or the email the union sent to all pilots just to prove a point. Time will prove what I'm telling you, just like time has shown how wokeism will destroy a company or time has proven that being a sanctuary city will destroy that city. You may think you're right just because reddit echos how your feelings but reddit is just a woke liberal breeding ground.</div>

    <div class="md">Typical woke redditor linked a video that shows every argument I have and that data but woke redditors just have them mentality that if I don't like it, then it's false.   Are you pilots? Are you paying attention to the clear rise in incidents involving atc mishaps. Has your life been at risk from an air traffic controller that would never have been qualified to be one until D&I started I bet you would take it more seriously if you had a close call or it affected your life everyday. Do you as a pilot it's harder for me to become an air traffic controller than someone who has no experience but is of color and didn't participate in sports who is not good a science. The way the Faa has the test set up a pilot on gets 2 points, and someone with atc experience gets 1 but a colored/gay person who has zero aviation experience that only graduated high school gets 10 for color 10 for high school graduate. The candidate with the most points gets moved to the next test, so please argue that makes sense. I would love to see you try. 

   The boy at the flight club I belonged to couldn't get hired as an atc when he has multiple certifications, has been doing virtual atc for 10 years, and graduated college and holds a private pilot license because he is not gay and has a degree now how is that fair. I work for a major air carrier, and a union representative sends out statistics about D&I it's clear it does not work in all fields. It may work in sales or marketing,  teaching, but I'm sorry color should not qualify a person over a person with actually experience</div>

    <div class="md">There are plenty out there that you clearly didn't watch any of the videos I linked. The first one shows the increase in serious atc mishaps since the THE FAA started the programs.  You have no data saying it's beneficial, so like I said, time is proving my point, not yours. It's just a matter of time until a fatal incident occurs and it's a D&I atc that caused it. I find it funny that your only argument is I dont believe you when I have shown you 3 examples that support my argument, but you are so woke you can not take the time to watch them. As someone who interacts with atc and spends time talking to other pilots, it's a serious concern that people lives are at risk being woke won't stop that</div>

    <div class="md">Diversity and inclusion is good. It's bad if someone who's qualified to do something is forced out of a field because of racism or sexism. But it's also bad if it goes into the other extreme where standards are lowered for people of specific races. 

It actually hurts other people of that race in that field quite a lot if they are properly credentialed and experienced. Imagine you're a remarkable black employee and your company just announced that they have lower requirements for minorities. Now every person that sees you, coworker customer etc, is going to wonder if you're really up to the job. 

TL:DR: Racism is horrible and shouldn't be a part of the workplace but let's not be idiots</div>

    <div class="md">I'm talking about the OLD old system. There was a time when someone's race was an unfair barrier to entry. They had to be MORE qualified than a white person to be considered for the same job. Diversity and inclusion for the sake of not making someone's skin color a factor in determining if you will hire them is a good thing.</div>

    <div class="md">But that's what it's doing. The faa was sued for just that. Unemployed colored candidates received more more points than candidates who went to college and had and atc certification. The more points the better the chances of passing to the next phase. Active pilots would received 2 points for being a pilot but a colored person who was bad at science got 10. I'm not macking it up the FAA was sued and lost over this they changed the questionnaire but it still rewards more points to colored,  gay or Trans candidates</div>

    <div class="md">I'll explain as it pertains to the faa and atc .During the Obama administration, the FAA moved to ‘off the street’ hiring with diversity as a criteria, passing over graduates of FAA-approved university air traffic control programs.The FAA launched the Collegiate Training Initiative in 1997, working with colleges and universities to offer air traffic control degrees, and making their graduates the primary source for hiring controllers. This trumped the previous requirement of a high school degree and three years of (unrelated) work experience. In 2005 the FAA Inspector General recommended adding coursework to these schools to reduce training time at the FAA’s academy. The FAA didn’t do this, and Congress directed a study of the move in agency’s 2012 reauthorizatio

Instead, during the Obama administration, the FAA started an Air Traffic Controller Recruitment Campaign which bypassed graduates. A decision made by the FAA, and not by the Air Traffic Organization, meant that both high school graduates and those with air traffic control degrees had to apply through the same program and pass both the standard aptitude test for controllers and a biographical test. This change had the effect of bypassing hundreds of controller graduates.


Facing pressure to diversify an overwhelmingly white workforce, the FAA began using a biographical test as a first screen of candidates.
Meanwhile, minority candidates were fed “buzz words” to bump their resumes up to top priority. Apparently saying your worst subject in school was science served as a golden ticket. Correct answers to the take-home test to groups who fit the diversity the FAA was after. a class action lawsuit brought by Collegiate Training Initiative students who got passed over has uncovered some pretty bad hiring practices at the FAA.  


So here's what the questionnaire includes: as of 2022

A question as to what your worst subject was in school. There were several options, including science, math, and a few others. The BEST answer for you to give was that "Science" was your WORST subject. 10 points for that answer. More points is better.

A question about how many suggestions you had made to your employer in the last 3 years. The BEST answer (10 points) was that you were not employed in the last 3 years and therefore made no suggestions. (In other words, it's a disguised question designed to determine whether you have been employed in the last 3 years, and you get 10 points if you have not been.)

In another question: 10 points for having no relevant experience, 4 points for having ATC experience, 2 points for being a pilot. 

In short, it's a questionnaire designed to ask questions that technically are permissible, in order to determine information that it is illegal to ask directly in screening: what's your race or ethnic background.

To dumb it down points are given to candidates. Pilots or college graduates of the FAA program are given 2 points per question but a person of color and high school graduates get 10 points. A white person bad a science would not get the same amount of points as a colored person who was bad a science. A white person who played sports did not receive receive points where. Color or gay person who did not play sports would get points. The more points a candidate has the better the chances are to getting hired and trained.  The FAA has since changed the questionnaire in 2022 the point value is still used and pilots or graduates of the college ATC Academy started by the FAA do not have a better chance than someone with just a diploma. 

The issue is coming to ahead now with increasing runway incursions and mid air collisions caused by atc not doing their job. Last year there was 4 very close calls with planes being less that 200ft apart from a collision. The other problem is the amount of tax payer money being used to catch applicants up to those who payed  for college to earn a certification from the atc academy  and not having the employees stay long enough to recoup the cost of training. Since 2019 the data show more pilot reported atc deviations( pilot reporting atc because of unsafe conditions created by atc or for a hostile exchanges)</div>

    <div class="md">> those who *paid* for college

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*</div>

    <div class="md">Do more research 2022 was the most recent changes. They still use the point system and the ASTA still has questions about employment and school subject with more points being awarded to unemployed. You are cherry picking points to say who care it's changed. Was this right to do in the first place. Was this fair to people who went to college and finished the atc program. Funny you have no issue with the way the test penalized those candidates. Leads me to believe you must have never applied your self and been screwed  because of a program like this. I had to do the same process every other America pilot had to complete with 1500hrs and multiple years or training to become a pilot if someone could bypass all that and be hired because of color is that fair</div>

I simply stated it was removed in 2018. 
That statement does not mean I think the short era of said practice was good or beneficial. 

That last sentence, are you saying pilots, who are POC, have to complete the necessary flight training? And if so, where did you find that bit of info?</div>

The reason you're a troll I showed you how the federal government started a D&I program that was allowing unqualified people to become atc. Your response is that it's  not happening anymore. You can not admit what the faa did was wrong, and its sole purpose was to pick colored, gay or Trans candidates over those who had certifications, so what's the point . Any evidence I've shown is not good enough. Just Today I hear a argument with atc on the radio. My captains response was, " D&I's finest hire may be in a little trouble," and he made a report just because we heard it. I live this every day it's an issue. I really do not care what your viewpoints are.

But I am 100% sure if you were on a flight that almost collided with another aircraft from incompetent atc, you would care. The u.s hasn't had a large fatal plane crash or a wide body crash in an amazing amount of time, but it's coming, and it will be the result of the faa enacting policies like "Be atc"</div>

    <div class="md">Lol. 
You expect people to be impressed that you've been to Boston, Baltimore, and Florida? Oh wow. 

Dude, if the full scope of what you said occurred, yeah, that'd be messed up. 

However, you seem chaotic and extremist, so it's difficult to see how much is true and how much is you being scared of shadows. 

And if you're implying you are an ATC, hard to tell since You're rather elusive about it, how do we know if you are any good at the job. You might be shitty.</div>

    <div class="md">Better look again 2022 was the most recent changes and the points still exist. The faa was sued and it was no longer allowed to be a take home queationaire. The main issue is the hires that made it thru with the original queationaire are responsible for the increasing incidents. Clearly you didn't not bother to read what I wrote because I said there was changes. It's funny your only argument is oh they stopped this not that it's wrong and unfair</div>

    <div class="md">So it's a rant when I literally copy and pasted from the complaint from the class action lawsuit. It's funny my rant shows d&I programs literally sole intent was to hurt only group to help another so your fine with that. My rant showed the FAA was cherry picking candidates based on color I guess your fine with that. My rant proved the faa was picking the least qualified candidates Over those who finished the college program I guess your are fine with that. And lastly it prove that the faa was picking candidates that wouldn't have been qualified under the old system over candidates that went to the program the faa started and those candidates were  punished because of that. I guess your fine knowing at any moment unqualified atc,s could cause a catastrophic crash. But hey they took some questioning off so it's ok now</div>

    <div class="md">You realize the government lost so it does exactly what I wanted to prove my point. Clearly you are just a woke liberal that even when someone proves D&I is bad for all people not just one group your can not accept it. You won't say what they did was wrong so Clearly being woke and defending liberal political points is more important than the truth. One Last point go touch grass, touch grass ,touch grass. I've never received some many messages about someone being a troll as I have with you. So go touch grass and maybe you will understand. I should have know someone on reddit would only turn out to be woke scum who lives in their mothers basement at 40</div>

The rule was created because FFS 40 years ago teams would pass on a guy like McDaniel because they would be concerned about how people would perceive them hiring a Black coach…

    <div class="md">[McDaniel said he had an epiphany at an early age when he was visiting his grandmother on his father’s side of the game. When he looked at the photos around the house, he realized he looked different than other members of his family.  “It is surreal when I think about it, but I remember one particular day, walking around and all of a sudden noticing that, ‘Hey, I’m the only fair-skinned person in all these picture frames,’” McDaniel said. “My grandmother on my dad’s side is Black. My dad’s Black.  “I can honestly say up to that point, I hadn’t noticed that I was different in two fields. I was different in that I was multi-racial to the world. But even within my own family, I was different from them. I was just kind of a unicorn.”](https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/why-football-is-more-than-just-a-sport-to-49ers-oc-mcdaniel/1135561/)</div>

    <div class="md">I hate the nfl, and reddit, for so many reasons. I don't know anything other than you what you posted but we can agree on that at least. People argue that these sites can basically do whatever they want since it's constitutionally their right. Ok, but can they at least consistently follow their own rules, and can they stop getting preferential treatment? Imo when uncle sam enables crony capitalism they are in effect engaging in de facto censorship.</div>

    <div class="md">The NFL has a number of racist policies.    They are a meritocracy for players and an affirmative action factory for all other positions.  

I believe the rules should be changed so that the race of team members must match American society.  

Whites 
Blacks
Hispanic 
Asian
Indian
   
That is what the NFL supports every where else.   It should apply to them.</div>

    <div class="md">The left seems to think it's somehow related to hating women or being jealous of her success. Of course that's just the left trying to fit racism or sexism into every conversation and being the basis for every opinion they don't agree with.

I could give two fucks about Taylor Swift. My issue is I'm trying to watch a football game, not worry about how she feels about the game. If she were just there to support her boyfriend, nobody would care, but it's not. She's there because it's a photo op. It's not about hate, it's just fucking annoying.</div>

    <div class="md">You used the word "upset", I said "annoyed". But nice attempt at manipulation.  
People watching football want the game to be about the game, not panning to a superstar every time her boyfriend makes a big play.   
I don't remember any of those people being shown nearly as much as her, though.</div>

Oh yeah that's another thing you people do.. assume everyone that doesn't agree with you is a "Right Winger". That just means you're stuck in your woke echo chamber and see the world as us vs them. That's a really narrow minded viewpoint, isn't it?  
I might lean a little right on some issues but I'm by no means a MAGA tard or what could be considered a right-winger by your standard.  
Don't feel bad though, the actual right wingers are stuck in their own echo chamber and see the world just as narrow mindedly.</div>

    <div class="md">Would we though? If they panned to anyone as much as they show her it would still be annoying.

Your "man children" argument also doesn't hold water, I know several women that love Taylor Swift and find the constant panning to her annoying because they're there to watch football. 

If we wanted to see her that much, we'd buy a ticket to her concert.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly you're the one making it an argument.  
You seem to think I'm mad at Taylor Swift or one of the other ridiculous accusations I keep hearing from the people offended that someone could possibly have something to say about her. I'm an insecure male, I'm mad that she's successful, stronk powerful womyn bothers me because I'm weak.  
I could care less about her, and that's kind of the point. She's not entertainment. She's not even performing. She has nothing to do with football. It's an annoyance, and I'd feel the same way if they kept panning to any other unrelated celebrity after the Chiefs score a touchdown.</div>

    <div class="md">I work for Samsung. Samsung invests a lot of money bringing certain high level Koreans over to live in the US from HQ to be a part of the company. They also hire the Korean friends and family of those employees based on the fact that they're Korean, not because they're particularly good at anything.

If you are Korean and work for Samsung in the US, you're never a contractor. You don't have to worry about layoffs because they only way you'll lose your job is if you quit. You are automatically the preferred candidate of choice for any job you apply for within the company provided you meet the basic minimum requirements. 

Samsung is a Korean supremacist company. 

Now replace "Korean" with "white".</div>

    <div class="md">My first serious girlfriend was Korean (I’m white), she was born in the states, her parents immigrated. Her dad was ridiculously racist in a way that was almost comical and completely stereotypical. He was mostly okay with me dating her. Said she wouldn’t be allowed in the house if she was dating a black man. They were deeply distrustful of any Chinese or Japanese people.

It’s stupid that people from the US seem to think that racism is just an American problem.</div>

    <div class="md">I just finished a 3 day site-wide ban for a comment I made on an thread about the person who tried to burn down MLK Jr's house the other day. I simply pointed out that every time one of these incidents happens there seems to be a consistency with the perpetrators.  I'm sure you can guess that consistency. I just got back so I won't repeat it lol, but yeah, the censorship is out of control on this site...</div>

    <div class="md">WTF no since the NFL was a white only QB and Coaches until very recently it is a equitable rule. It was not that long ago the the Oilers were regularly mocked for Warren Moon. He never got the calls white quarterbacks did. Then even later did Black coaches happen. It is a very recent trend. Equality is not discrimination!</div>

    <div class="md">That mayor in Illinois, Tiffany Henyard, seems like a black supremacist. She believes she’s above criticism because she’s “a black woman in power” and is paying herself $300k per year meanwhile she’s forging checks and flying first class and hiring her friends. 

There was that guy who ran over 6 people at a parade in an SUV in Waukesha, Darrell Brooks, he literally refers to himself as a black supremacist. 

So does black supremacy not exist because merely asking if it exists is racist?</div>

    <div class="md">What Ronin said was that they’ve never heard someone use the term “black supremacy” that wasn’t racist. 

I’m using the term black supremacy, and I’m not racist, since I’m dating an African immigrant and I’ve had black partners for the last 5 years. And since you’re about to say “the old I’m dating a black person”, are you dating a person of color? 

How many friends do you have that are a different race? How does a lack of friends of different skin color or a multitude have anything to do with someone’s internal moral values</div>

    <div class="md">I got called fascist for pointing out multiple studies that show that obese people are more likely to spread Covid and the flu. I’ve had people on the left side of my girlfriend is suffering from internalized racism for dating a white guy. I’ve seen people on Reddit called her an Uncle Tom. I’ve gotten more criticism for dating a girl who grew up Mormon but left the church then dating a Muslim girl who thinks BLM is stupid and thinks most trans people are just attention seeking narcissists. The fact all of you got played by Ibrahim X Kendi, the struggle sessions. Most of you are so desperate just to know a black person that you will constantly talk about race to prove that you are racist. I don’t care that my girlfriend is black, she is just a hot chick who is quite intelligent, who happens to be black. Just because you are obsessed with race doesn’t mean the rest of us need to be.

You guys appear to have so little understanding of the actual definitions of words that if you say something is racist, most likely you are just being irrational or hysterical.</div>

    <div class="md">… Dude I am literally mixed… You get the racial dating dynamics that unfairly target you and your partners are due to Right Wing politics going back to the Colonial period and it’s shitty when some segments of different group are racists, most of those who do that shit are reactionary conservative members of their race even if they claim to be liberal or progressive — SEE DR. UMAR. 

Kendi isn’t the end all or be all of anti racism or critical race scholarship and I implore you to expand on what you’re reading and ask what specifically do you disagree with him on? 

The LDS Church deserves criticism for its continued racist policies even towards its own BIPOC and AAPI members. That said if you wanna date someone who is Mormon, go for it! That shouldn’t automatically disqualify them as there are a lot of good people who happen to be LDS or former LDS.</div>

    <div class="md">I didn’t date “a Mormon”. I dated a girl who was raised in the Mormon church and had left the church when she was 19. I dated her when she was 29. She had been out of the church for a decade, and just the fact that I said “my girlfriend used to be Mormon” nonstop lectures about how terrible the Mormon church was. How is that her fault, at all? She didn’t even go to church anymore or believe in it. 

The approach is always gonna be “conservatives are worse” which means that you’ll never hold liberals accountable because at least they aren’t conservative. I’ve had a liberal friend say that me bringing up I was raped was the same as saying “all lives matter”. Why am I expected to believe these people are not terrible humans? They are liberal, they hold “the correct opinions” so they can’t be bad people right? 

My issue with Kendi is that he’s a grifter. You are aware that’s not even his real name right? He’s doing it for money, and I can prove that too. He is ripping off white people who feel terrible about their skin color, he’s gotten $40 million to “study racism”. He got cornered at an event when someone asked him if vaccine passports were inherently racist and he said yes. So the same people who are anti racist also think vaccines should be mandatory, which is impossible to be anti racist if you support an inherently racist program. Since Kendi is an expert on racism, we need to trust his judgment. 

On the other hand, plenty of terrible shit that Muslims do, including the fact that my Muslim girlfriend had FGM done to her as a baby, but my social group will NEVER say anything negative about the Muslim faith, or say “that’s shitty that you are dating a Muslim” but people had plenty to say about me dating someone who wasn’t even Mormon anymore. Nobody will criticize Islam because they are terrified of being labeled “an ism”. My first girlfriend was Korean. She wasn’t AAPI. My current girlfriend is West African. She’s not BIPOC. Those are your labels, not mine, but if I don’t comply and use your terms then I’m racist, apparently. 

That’s the issue, that people are hypocritical and not even remotely logical about how and what they will criticize, they have ZERO principles. Obesity increases covid transmission rates, meaning you are more likely to spread Covid if you are obese (and there are dozens of studies about this) but again, no criticism of obese people, plenty of criticism of people who won’t get a booster shot, even if they are athletic or have legitimate concerns about it. Like black people. 

I bring up obesity increases Covid spread because there is vast amounts of scientific evidence that people refuse to accept because it’s worse (apparently) to be fatphobic then to spread Covid and potentially kill someone. And these same people have the “in this house we follow science” signs. What science do they follow, exactly? Clearly not all the science. Not the science that says obesity is unhealthy. Why should I trust them on anything else?</div>

There’s a ton of stuff out there on Kendi. Robin DeAngelo is also a race grifter. People have a profit motive 

Since I’m sure you have strong opinions about Covid, I’m fully vaccinated, and I exercise regularly. I go to the gym. I have abs. I can bench 275. That makes me less likely to spread Covid then an obese person, so why are obese people lying to themselves and us they are passionate about Covid mitigation? If they aren’t exercising, they are lying. And we shouldn’t trust liars.</div>

    <div class="md">Not disputing that. Plenty of healthy men died, I think the 20-30 age group was under 1,000 from 2021-2022. 

It’s a deflection to say “lots of healthy men in their 20s died” because lots could be 100,000 or 1,000,000. When I looked at the CDC death rates, the virus was especially dangerous to people over 60. The data backs that up. Covid was highly unlikely to kill you if you were under 40, regardless of the vaccine. And the CDC also buried data on booster effectiveness because “young people already had plenty of protection from the first two shots”. The first booster did almost nothing for our age group, so they hid the data and just used the 50+ data to make the numbers look better. It wasn’t my fault they lied.

People think Covid was deadly to children because 1500 kids died, by the end of 2021. 1500 children is a lot of kids, but is it statistically significant? Does the fact one kid died mean that it’s equally dangerous to every other child? 

Obesity doesn’t just “play a role”. It literally increases spread. This isn’t up for debate, because we already all know obesity increases transmission of influenza, and there are a dozen studies for Covid. One doctor I’ve spoken with that I dated said it’s been grounded research for decades obesity increases virulence.

Because we know obesity increases spread with influenza, and Covid, it’s on the fat people to prove they aren’t a danger to society. It’s not on me to prove they are, because they will never listen. They will never be uncomfortable or go to the gym because they think it’s boring or fatphobic. If fat people think it should be mandatory to get vaccinated, then so is exercise. They don’t get “a pass to spread Covid just because they are fat” because they refused to grant any exemptions to vaccine mandates. They said people should be black listed, fired from their jobs, permanently banned from hospitals and restaurants.</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t think I have any real disagreement with your approach. We probably have somewhat similar mindsets. Sounds like you’re a legitimately good person who is making sacrifices in your life.

My main issue has always been that I live in a very white area. I know a lot of white women who have masters degrees, never dated outside their race, and seem like they think it’s their job to tell me what I’m obligated to think.

It’s no different then what I saw when I was forced to go to church when I was a kid. Nonstop lectures about my moral failings and thought police from Christian’s, and a lot of liberals do the exact same thing.

I don’t like Dylan Mulvaney. At all. I think they are really fucking annoying. I hate all influencers. I’m not allowed to dislike Dylan because the reason anyone dislikes them is transphobia, it’s never up to personal preference. That’s the problem. That it’s about control, and some of us fucking hate being told what to do. I’ve dated a guy, most of my friends are gay, I don’t need to be told what to do by people who think they are better then me because they have a degree.</div>

They think ARs have zero value, and are responsible for every mass shooting. Also wildly inaccurate. They refuse to actually understand the things they are talking about.

I’ve asked people who say “obesity isn’t a choice” if they know the caloric difference between a gram of fat vs a carb. I’ve asked if they know that PPL means, or how hypertrophy works. They have zero understanding of basic nutrition, zero understanding of muscle structure and how calories work, yet they KNOW nobody can lose weight, but they can’t explain how people build muscle, which is a very basic concept. 

Most people in Seattle are insane. There are constantly fat people wearing masks outside, there has never been any evidence of outdoor transmission. They have wildly contradictory opinions and beliefs and engage in a cult like following and adherence. I’ve seen friends talking about the “how great and important Ghostbusters was” that had never seen the movie, but they knew it was pro-woman, so they have to defend it, that’s why grifters like Kendi or Robin DeAngelo have so much money, because it’s so fucking easy to take advantage of woke liberals. Just say “I’ll help you solve your racism”, give me money. There was that wealthy black woman who was charging people $3k to go to your house, have dinner with you and berate you for your racism.

Katie Herzog got death threats for writing an article interviewing detransitioners. She got called a Nazi, coffee shops on Capitol Hill wouldn’t serve her because she had the audacity to do interviews with people and listen to their stories. 

The issue I have is that nobody on the left can identify grifters. The men in the UK who self Identified as trans 1 week before sentencing are obviously lying, but because you “can’t question anyone’s identity” they get a pass. You aren’t allowed to question whether any trans person is authentic, even though we have stories and evidence of people planning out how to lie for better prison conditions. You can’t call out Kendi or robin, because if they are lying, the whole system implodes. The BLM leadership is a perfect example of how ridiculously easy it is to rip people off. One of my heroes is Fred Hampton, he would probably think a lot of the current obsession with race is backwards. He tried to look past race and focus on class. You guys just want to obsess over what’s the gender pronoun of the day. It’s just narcissism. It’s all narcissism.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude, Reagan pushed the Mulford Act to limit minorities access to guns and enacted the most strict gun laws in US history history. As President he also signed for Amnesty in the 80s. Conservatives are massive authoritarian hypocrites on gun laws. 

Most actual Leftists from the more left ends of DEMSOC, to Anarchists, Zapatistas, ANCOMs, and even Marxists believe in the ownership of guns, especially for the working classes as protection for state oppression and acts of violence from Right Wing reactionaries against the general working class class and the various minority groups that make up segments of the working class. Even Marx and Engels are staunchly pro gun and Engels served in the Prussian military as an artillery man. Smedley Butler was the most decorated Marine in history and Orwell states a gun should be in every worker’s home and he served in the British Army.</div>

    <div class="md">So why do most liberals alive today have zero understanding of how a gun operates but know they are evil, and believe AR15s are full auto? Wouldn’t it be misinformation?

I don’t care about Reagan, I’m not a conservative. You don’t need to do whataboutism on every single thing, unless you just hate accountability so fucking much or you are so weak and fragile you can’t own up to the fact many people we know are fucking morons.</div>

    <div class="md">There is documented bigotry within the LGBTQ community towards trans folks as there was similar bigotry aimed at Bi folks in the 80s and 90s. Or how you see the Light Skin vs Dark skin bullshit, etc.

Statistically, she is much safer around trans women than straight men. [Here is some info that might help you understand trans folks and the pernicious myths about them.](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/5/13/17938088/transgender-people-rights-myths)

[Myth : Letting trans people use the bathroom or locker room matching their gender identity is dangerous](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/5/13/17938102/transgender-people-bathrooms-locker-rooms-schools)

The fears of trans women hurting assigned at birth females is more a condemnation of us straight guys than trans women as it’s misplaced fear about the very real and very high chance  women in the US will be sexually assaulted or raped by straight men, generally a guy she knows.</div>

    <div class="md">50% of the people who have touched me without consent at gay bars were gay men. The other 50% were trans. I’ve been raped when I was sleeping, by a gay man who I thought was my friend. Most of my friends are gay, I know plenty about the lifestyle. I go to pride parties on a regular basis.

So it seems like a lot of the bad behavior seems to be from your precious LGBTQ community. Unless those trans women, like aren’t real women and they are just gay men wearing a dress, which would make far more sense because I’ve never had a straight girl at a bar grab my junk without consent.

What are trans women before they “self identify as trans?” Typically, Gay men. I’m not gonna respect the identity of someone who thinks they can grab me without consent, I don’t give a shit if “misgendering” harms them, maybe don’t touch people without asking them first. 

Dylan Mulvaney is a narcissistic gay man who is apparently now a “real woman”. Totally. It’s not like there’s literal documentation of Dylan realizing how popular the days of girlhood was then running with it after trying a bunch of other stuff trying to go viral.</div>

    <div class="md">I am sorry people touched you without consent, it is definitely an issue that is talked about in the LGBTQ community about etiquette and touching/ consent and it can be at odds with the hookup culture in some gay bars. 

The sad thing is in your first message you passionately argue against people generalizing and stereotyping White people, yet you take the bad actions of a few individuals and decide to not only stereotype them, but actively engage in attacking their identity and engaging in harmful acts towards gay and trans men. It’s kind of wild that you don’t want people to do that to you or white people yet you’re cool doing it to gay men and trans women. Do you hold the same views for Trans men? 


Again you can almost totally cut out Mulvaney from 99% of your life with only the most minimal of effort. Literally all celebs are narcissistic to a degree and they all hide behind a public mask.</div>

    <div class="md">Great, more excuses. The left doesn’t have any problems, we don’t need to actually conduct ourselves accordingly, nobody is leaving the left, all of us are open minded and super tolerant. 

I’ve never heard any of my friends talk trash about poor people in the Midwest, people in abject poverty in rural America but I guess you aren’t “punching down” in that case, because even if you live in a trailer park in Ohio, if you are a conservative (god forbid) you are somehow privileged. 

Somehow a white person who works part time at Walmart and survives off food stamps is somehow “more privileged” then my Indian and Asian friends who work at Amazon, live in $3500 apartments or own a 4 bedroom house and have a Tesla.

Covid was the last straw, you all abandoned healthcare is a human right. You played your hand. 

I don’t give a shit what conservatives do, it’s not my problem. Can’t you just ignore them? Didn’t you say that about how i should just ignore the people in my city who said we should be allowed to shoot people without masks? Shouldn’t I just ignore all the trans people who have groped me at gay bars? “They aren’t hurting you, just ignore them”. What has Alex Jones done to personally harm you, just ignore him….</div>

A black trans person could be a rapist, even though the number of trans rapists is almost non existent.

    <div class="md">“Non existent”. I’ve been grabbed at gay bars by no less then 20 trans people. It seems to be common enough that I’m more likely to be sexually assaulted by a trans person then a straight man… so I know who the real enemy is. The people committing the sexual assault. Or does my “lived experience” not matter….

I live in Seattle. There aren’t any conservatives here so I do not care what they do, stop avoiding accountability.</div>

    <div class="md">No you don’t get my frustration because you think you are better then people because you obviously have a masters degree, and it’s your responsibility to “teach people” what the right opinions are to have. 

You don’t even understand basic stuff like defending your opponents argument. All you’d need to say is “there’s a lot of abject poverty in the US and I also find it difficult that some people on the left are so out of touch with what the Midwest is like”. Unless you’ve never been. And driven through towns with 400 people where there is nothing. No jobs, no resources, just poverty and drug abuse and zero hope.

I went there because I knew I was probably wrong. Maybe some of these people I was told I had to hate might not actually be as bad as you all said. Maybe they are just poor and don’t have the same advantages I did.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude, you’re literally pushing Alt Lite White Supremacy… you do get that in a league predominantly made up of minorities the fact there are very few Black, Latino, Indigenous, or Asian head coaches is nuts considering the number of elite level coordinators of color there are in the NFL. The NFL had to institute this so minority coaches could get a shot at HC jobs and Rooney (Pittsburgh’s Owner) saw it as a way to instill equity and help teams get the best coach, not just a coach.</div>

    <div class="md">This is a completely bullshit hack attempt at a straw man. The league is mostly Black due to a mix of talent and socioeconomic reasons, partially that non working class and poor White people have economic opportunities that mean they don’t have to specialize in sports and rely on that as a way to rise socio economically. 

How you got the idea that I believe there is something wrong with White people existing is a massive leap to conclusions that is not supported by anything I have said. In fact it’s a projection of your insecurities. There is nothing wrong with White people existing  — and I would have to hate myself as I am partially of European descent. 

*There is a problem with systemic racism and White Supremacy* as these ideologies artificially elevate White people over other groups as a way to not actually have to compete with them on the Free Market. The argument that I and others make is let’s tear down these artificial, oppressive systems and if you actually believe in Meritocracy and equality of opportunity you would support breaking down these barriers as well.


There is nothing wrong with White people, but it is wrong to completely ignore all the evidence that there are systems and institutions in place that unfairly advantage White people to the literal existential detriment of other races.</div>

    <div class="md">What are you talking about? It’s a professional sport and those are essentially capitalism boiled down to its purest form. They’re picking the best players from the pool of players they have. If there are fewer white players it’s because some people have other avenues for success or for some reason there isn’t a large number of white players with NFL level talent.
 

It’s really embarrassing how hard you’re trying to make this a “reverse racism” thing.</div>

    <div class="md">[They are 56% more likely than any other ethnic group to make it to the professional level](https://www.ksbw.com/article/suspect-arrested-in-deadly-hit-and-run-in-salinas-california/46756894) a mix of socio economic factors and Polynesians athletes often being the near perfect combo of speed, size, and athleticism is what so many Polynesians play in the NFL.

You also see a large number of poor and rural White athletes playing in the NFL as rural life is conducive to become strong and athletic and rural communities often share similar economic disadvantages as urban areas leading to football and other sports being a major tool of socioeconomic mobility.</div>

    <div class="md">I got banned because I stuck up for Russell Wilson when they were pointing out that his former teammates were trashing him, after week One: 2022 season. 

By that point Russell had never been in trouble, and had posted his strongest seasons when the Defense was 22nd & 15th (2019 & 2020 seasons, total yards allowed). Russell **had never 💩’d on: 

- Richard Sherman for drunken harassment of his child’s Mother. 

- Marshawn Lynch for being a Buffalo Bills washout before Pete Carroll resurrected his career. Lynch was replaced by Fred Jackson. 

- Earl Thomas was a disaster in Baltimore and refused to learn their Defensive scheme. Earl had some legal troubles leading up to his divorce. 

When I reasonably pointed out that Russell’s treatment for not being “Black enough” was a double standard and petty; the “sheep” presumed that I have issues with Black people, when I am a Black man who believes in meritocracy. I have seen firsthand that the so-called woke often leaves room for those who wish to exploit & seek only self supremacy; while good qualities that transcend race, get overlooked by the so-called “woke”.</div>

    <div class="md">movies are horrible, all the streaming services are failing because they refuse to give any minority or femae or gay character flaws, there is no heros journey they are just perfect or its white mens fault.  noone is watching this woke garbage and they seem to be starting to turn it around in some companies, thank god wwe never went that route.  i watched how to get away with murder which is great until they do they very unwoke thing of killing the black main character, while i can appreciate a swerve he was the only relatable character and then they went woke a year later and made every white character murder someone, rape someone or commit incest(not kidding). they will keep calling us racist for wanting quality but they arent going to these movies or watching these shows, they are morbidly obese karens who wasted thier lives so they want to mess with ours.</div>

    <div class="md">… or they’re putting out movies in an over saturated market and the runs they had with the Avengers/ X-Men/ Spider Man films was just a mix of luck and great casting. If you don’t think Hollywood has well written, complex minority characters it might be that you either don’t watch a wide variety of shows or just have shit taste in TV and movies</div>

    <div class="md">Luck lol, no they have admitted to illegally using dei  for casting and writing, they just scared 10 episodes of daredevil and are rewriting the show because they deemed it un viable to air because it was so bad. The girl who played echo has bever acted she was a Chubby amazon warehouse worker who admitted she cast to star Ina show because she is deaf native American and the only person who showed up to audition.</div>
