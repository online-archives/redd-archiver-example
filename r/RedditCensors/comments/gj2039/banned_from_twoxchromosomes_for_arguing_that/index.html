Here are the comments I posted on TwoX - no idea which one I was banned for:

&gt;We also don't show people cleaning up dog shit with bounty paper towels or blowing giant yellow snot/semen loads all over their kleenex.

&gt;Is it because society is afraid of dogs or is it possible that these brands don't want to be associated with feces/semen/blood even if that's what they're generally used for?

&gt;Careful - we're not allowed to be too reasonable on this sub. [Added after reaching 5 downvotes]

---

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To be fair with the way he seems to treat women he might actually be primarily using kleenex for semen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The way I seem to treat women?

&gt;&gt;&gt;You certainly took a lot from a comment I made about marketing friend.

&gt;&gt;"Careful -we're not allowed to be too reasonable on this sub". Written about a sub for women, about women's issues. Do you claim that was not a disrespectful comment playing into the old trope of women being irrational and unreasonable? And then turning around with a classic gaslighting "you are reading too much into this".

&gt;&gt;I feel sorry for any woman in your life.

&gt;Bro TwoXChromosomes is not indicative of women in general at all whatsoever.

&gt;I'm pretty sure it's modded by mostly men right off the bat.

&gt;It's like a parody of feminism IMO.

&gt;My wife laughed at this thread and agreed that she doesn't want to see blood in tampon commercials - she said she wouldn't want to see poop in diaper commercials either. Who would've thought except, you know, every normal human being.

&gt;Secondly, you're silly for passing judgement on others because of a reddit comment you're not even intelligent enough to read properly.

&gt;Stop trying so hard to be offended - it makes you look really silly.

---

&gt;Yeah, this is the thing that feminists don't seem to understand when they talk about things like the "pink tax."

&gt;We all have to poop - it's not our choice - why do we have to pay taxes on toilet paper?

&gt;And they also conveniently neglect to mention the fact that there are plenty of men buying tampons/pads for their family members (wives, daughters, mothers, etc.).

&gt;I've bought feminine hygiene products most of my life (and I've obviously never used them).

---

&gt;I was referring to specifically complaints about tax on tampons/pads which are all over the sub ([22k upvotes here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/873ub0/more_states_move_to_end_tampon_tax_thats_seen_as/)).

&gt;As for female products costing more than their comparable male counterparts, I think you can guess who's to blame there (hint: it's not men).

&gt;There's no point in buying a more expensive razor just because it's pink (and visa versa).

&gt;If pink razors were half price, that's all I'd buy.

---

&gt;While I have qualms with this sub, this is obviously too far.

&gt;And one of the qualms is that they ban pretty liberally so... RIP

---

&gt;&gt;toilet paper literally isn’t taxed because it’s a bodily function

&gt;Toilet paper is taxed - just like almost everything else sold to people of every sex.

&gt;https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/02/08/tampon-sales-tax-should-not-be-eliminated-in-texas/

&gt;As to your second point, obviously companies are going to charge what people are willing to pay. If women are willing to pay more for the pink version of the same thing because they buy into the marketing, they should just ... not do that... right? Problem solved.

---

&gt;Sorry you had to deal with this thread also - love you 💖

&gt;Thanks for fighting the good fight - my wife agrees with you too.

How...how though? It directly relates to women. Should we start promoting advertisements with women pumping breast milk and show it on tv too? Or maybe condom adds with semen?

Mensie blood doesnt need to be depicted in commercials. It can be triggering for people. It does not empower women at all. 

Using blue colored water would be fine.and safer option to depict absorption.

Also,
 


They refuses to remove a post that was geared towards generalizing and judging all men to be the same.
When I brought up my concern, they said it didn’t violate rule 3.

I provided 3 points of explicit sexism geared against men.

And I asked them how it didnt? I never got a response.

Eh. I really wasted my time with them.</div>

    <div class="md">Ugh yeah - they were the first sub to ever ban me on reddit when I was new.

Every post had incredibly sexist overtones and anyone who pointed it out got the boot.

I'm glad that people like you exist though - it makes me feel a lot better about that type of thing.

It bothers me that this type of thing has become so prevalent - just tonight I was talking to my daughter (teenager) who told me that men should stay out of any discussion about abortion because it's a "woman's issue." I asked her how she'd feel if I told her to stay out of conversations because it was "men talking - we don't need a woman's opinion." I think she saw the sexism pretty quickly - and of course I went on to explain that it takes two people to make a baby - a man and a woman. There is some wild science coming out iirc that lets women conceive with one another - and of course I asked if trans men were allowed in the conversation since they can get pregnant too - and it became clear that she hadn't ever really thought about these things which is why discussions and reasoned dissent are so important.

Finally I ended with the fact that we're all human beings capable of empathising and discussing issues with one another regardless of our genetic attributes.

That's the lesson that should be taught in my opinion.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree!   
I've actually learned a lot of polices aren't this or that. pro or anti.  


Like with abortion for instance, after processing my views with my boyfriend and best friend who is a woman, I have seen that it's not a pro-life or pro-chice debate. It's how the heck to we get enough resources to the public to not even have this stupid dilemma.  
PS. Not a popular opinion:

Ex) Raising sex ed awareness, consent awareness. giving ppl (single or married) who get raped, quick accesses to plan-B (affordable and w/o insurance (in case of husband rapping them) so they don't get preggers. People who are pregnant, getting health assessments to help with mental and physical barriers to feeling well during pregnancy, WIC having more funding (my mom was a teen single mom, we used WIC and it was hard to get), better care for foster/adoptive children, and a discussion on what it means to have an abortion (I've had a friend get an abortion. It's FUCKING painful and messed up her menstral cycle for awhile) and yes, if a women is in severe distress after giving her what she needs to have a healthy pregnancy and offer a safe place for the child after, she should have care and the option. I don't want women/girls in that much distress harming themselves to cause an abortion either. and I understand some cultures, even in America, shun and disown their girls if they get pregnant before marriage. (but that's why there should be more to prevent unwanted pregnancies and have plan B be more accessible able.  


I dunno. it's a big picture many people miss in the midst of an emotionally charged argument over this or that. It's BOTH AND. omg. (I don't identify with stupid political parties because of this nonsense)</div>

    <div class="md">What prompts people like you to take the time to make comments like these?

Do you think I'm going to go cry to my wife and kids that "donaldslabia" feels sorry for them?

Do you think I'm going to feel bad about myself and change my mind about period blood in commercials or decide to treat disrespectful people with respect?

If you're only respectful because "the rules say I'm supposed to be" then you're literally the problem, not me.

I'm a respectful person by default - not because I'm ordered to be - because it's the right thing to do.

You, however, apparently need to be instructed to be a decent human being or you'll default back to being the pile of shit that you are.

Did I get that right?

    <div class="md">What am I supposed to feel ashamed of?

Seriously, point at one thing.

I never cried - this is a sub to point out censorship - I'm pointing out censorship.

The narrative is "*Women should be proud of their periods*" - I guess because only women bleed from their vaginas that they have - although that's not really right because not all women have vaginas... although the sub is literally called TwoXChromosomes (implying that "female" is biological in nature - which, obviously it is, but not on the TwoXChromosomes sub).

It's the kind of confusing, ridiculous, nonsense that causes the entire sub to fall into a logical paradox.</div>

    <div class="md">Hello again,

The sub you are currently posting in is r/RedditCensors.

This is a sub where people post about or "complain" (as you call it) about censorship that they have experienced while using reddit.

Here's a brief snippet from the FAQ that you may have missed:

&gt;This sub is dedicated to recording and highlighting instances of ideological censorship of thoughts, ideas, comments, submissions etc on reddit. 

Imagine going into a sub where people discuss their broken vehicles and saying, "*You're crying about your broken car - I'm trying to shame you into self awareness.*" Once again, I implore you to look in the mirror.

&gt;For what to be ashamed of, I'd start with jabbing at the population of the subreddit

What does this even mean? "Jabbing"? Obviously not the literal definition. 

I'm guessing you mean expressing a dissenting opinion?

I'm not ashamed for disagreeing with somebody about something.

&gt;Then the moment when you decided being banned was censorship.

Here's a little bit about the definition of the word censorship:

&gt;Censorship blocks something from being read, heard, or seen.

When banned, your comments are listed as `[removed]` as you may or may not know from using this site. I was censored by definition.

&gt;Then the long post that is nearly unintelligible because you posted so many comments. and so on...

Sorry that I ... say too much? Is that what I'm supposed to feel ashamed of?

If you have anything else to say, I'm happy to address it.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;you can avoid being "censored" by having intelligent discussion, without belittling whoever you're talking to.

I didn't call you a child and accuse you of crying.

Please, PLEASE - note your hypocrisy.

You can do it - I believe in you.

&gt;crying about being banned (for being disrespectful) and when I told you to take your tampon out and report whoever hurt your feelings like a big boy

&gt;I do feel sorry for the women in your life. lol They were right.

And finally, I believe you should be free to be a dick and not be censored.

Just take a look at the types of comments I receive:

https://old.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/gizgsx/proud_to_be_murican/fqioag0/

^ This is breaking reddit's TOS, it's been reported, and it's still up hours later.

I find the double standards disconcerting and you should too - that's why this sub exists.

I don't care if you want to tell me to take my tampon out and call me a baby bitch or whatever other shit you want to talk to me.

I'm an adult and I'm capable of dealing with mean words.</div>

It's really strange to spend so much time replying to things you don't care about.

Look, I'm guessing you're probably young and a bit confused about all this stuff - I'm not trying to be a dick to you.

It's okay to disagree but not really understand your arguments well enough - that's the whole point of having a conversation and why you find yourself drawn back into it.

We argue to refine our beliefs - that's part of the reason I'm here. I want them tested by people who are capable of testing them; it can be difficult to find people who make compelling arguments, but it happens.

Anyway, my point is this: I wear a helmet when I ride my motorcycle - I wear a mask in crowded areas.

I don't do it because I have to - I do it because I'm capable of making my own decisions as an adult.

This is called "freedom" and it must be preserved.

That's my $0.02.</div>

Absolutely agreed. Don't, however, pretend that was what you were doing.

Have no idea what the point of this was. Fuck your geriatric weird ass helmeted freedom with the tampon you rode in on, grandpa.</div>
