    <div class="md">It’s all semantics. I’m against any kind of speech censorship but I understand that some people are offended by words. The problem that everyone has stated about hate speech since the beginning is who decides what’s good or bad. Getting banned in a thread where I get downvoted dozens of times by lgbt members for saying that a word they use might be offensive to other people, is proof that hate speech won’t work. It’s everyone decides or no one decides</div>

    <div class="md">It’s so absurd but I do think in legal contexts like businesses or residency documents it might make sense when done properly. 

I completely agree with you but I’d say given so many cases like mine, it’s more “this person said mean thing about group I like, he must be punished for this, but I can’t be punished for anything I say about a group I don’t like”

They don't, though. When have you ever seen nigger used in the same context as nigga? The soft "A" version was made as a replacement to reclaim the word for the black community, whereas the original hard "R" variant is steeped in racial oppression throughout history.</div>

    <div class="md">The black dude I used to know would use those terms pretty much interchangeably. Ive also seen many instances of it on the media and such.  


Its pretty retarded to pretend like they are somehow magically two different words, where one is just a slight mispronunciation of the other, but I guess its all part of this linguistic war the left is waging, trying to control how people talk.</div>

    <div class="md">Saying "this one guy I know did this" isn't proof. 

I'm not pretending they're two different words. One is a variation of the other because the original has heavy racist connotations. 

&gt;but I guess its all part of this linguistic war the left is waging, trying to control how people talk.

Ok, so you're either some edgelord teenager who thinks being against the norm is cool, or you're some old fuck who think the current generation are spoilt children.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;When have you seen a black person use nigger in the same context as when they use the term nigga?

&gt;Saying "this one guy I know did this" isn't proof. 

You asked a question and I answered it.  


&gt; Ok, so you're either some edgelord teenager who thinks being against the  norm is cool, or you're some old fuck who think the current generation are spoilt children. 

What this bullshit is, its not the norm, its what you lot are trying to make into the new norm. 5 years ago nobody took retards shouting "nooo you cant use this word, it belongs to another race!" or "we are reclaiming this word for our own use haha" seriously.</div>

Come to where I work. You'll notice the difference in what emotion is used in the punounciation of *nigga* to reflect vitriol or comradery.</div>

    <div class="md">Love how quickly r/pics and all of these default subs went from condemning the use of the word "Karen" to celebrating and using it. I literally got banned from many subs or downvoted to oblivion at times less than a year ago for associating myself with being "anti-Karen" if you will since the word was apparently anti-woman. But now that the word's use is becoming associated with being negative against conservative upper middle class middle-aged white women, it's okay.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s annoying and stupid but I gotta say I love the irony of it all. 

Conservatives have said for years that hate speech doesn’t and will not work simply because there will always be a bias when it comes to deciding what words get banned. Hate speech supporters dismissed that argument saying it isn’t true and yet here’s another example of that very argument. 

I saw another form of this when a guy got arrested for eating raw meat in public. Officers said he was arrested because someone called and said they were offended. So the next day he went to McDonald’s and called the cops because he was offended that people were eating cooked meat. You can guess what did or more accurately didn’t happen. 

I just hope that one day these people will be in the minority on one of these issues and a word they constantly use gets banned.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes to both. Your comment seems like bait so I just want to point out that I don’t have any problem with anyone using the word Karen. I was defending someone getting bullied by dozens of people (some lgtb) for saying they thought Karen was offensive. 

I simply pointed out the hypocrisy of groups crying about one word being harmful to them but not supporting another groups claim because they themselves use that word in a way that isn’t harmful. &lt;- ie an example of the exact argument people used to say hate speech will never work</div>

    <div class="md">So you are trying to say that a common name has the same weight as a slur used to demean a sexual preference?

I mean I understand where you are coming from but I think a slur more like Pollock or Mick would be more similar. Even then it's not like Karen's have ever experienced any actual discrimination, and it's not like some one is automatically a Karen based on how they look or the accent in their voice. Being a Karen is a choice, it's almost like calling someone a bitch without using a swear.

I don't think it's offensive to call someone a bitch when they are acting like an entitled bitch.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; So you are trying to say that a common name has the same weight as a slur used to demean a sexual preference?

It’s all semantics. I made 2 points. The first is that if hate speech is a thing or words are considered offensive then all groups should decide what words are offensive to them and not just some. The second is that the initial meaning of a word doesn’t matter if it is used to offend a group today. 

The second point should be more impactful since the slur “Karen” (not name) was literally made as an insult and never had other meanings. 

It’s doesn’t just apply to the slur I used. I picked it because it’s probably the best example of a word that is used by the majority to mean something other than what the lgbt community says it does. Both historically and currently. It meant “women” then was derived to mean “bundle of sticks”, then slang was used to mean “cigarette” and only after each meaning the word was used by a small few (relative) to be an insult specifically aimed towards gay people. Even as an insult most used it to mean jerk or bitch and applied it to everyone. 

It’s arguable that “Karen’s” are discriminated against for being dumb, over dramatic, or entitled. It is used to describe a middle aged white women like every definition online says it is. The number one definition online and on urban dictionary by a large amount is racial (white) and all the definitions discriminate women. 

&gt; Even then it's not like Karen's have ever experienced any actual discrimination

I don’t think it’s a good argument to make that hate speech or offensive words need to be linked with tangible discrimination or a history that may include the target death of a group (that was big argument used in the thread I was banned from). To use that argument is saying that you (not specifically the person I’m replying to) don’t want to prevent any of that from happening.

&gt; I don't think it's offensive to call someone a bitch when they are acting like an entitled bitch.

I don’t either and I have no problem with anyone using the word Karen. I only understand where that comes from. Note that I replied to a thread of dozens of people bullying someone for saying that they considered Karen offensive.</div>
