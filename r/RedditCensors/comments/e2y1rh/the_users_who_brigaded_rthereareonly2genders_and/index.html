    <div class="md">Amazing how the admins are willingly going along with it. 

Not that anyone needs me to point it out, but.... 

If the rules aren't applied equally, if indeed the breaking of the rules are allowed, promoted and accepted depending on who is doing it - Then, there are no rules, and anyone that follows them are merely tying their own hands, censoring themselves, etc under the misplaced respect for the platform or what it claims to stand for. 

Make as many alt's as you like, because why not? 

Break as many of the rules as you like, because why not? 

Be as racists, sexist, rude, disgusting as you like, because why not? 

The great thing about this is that they have removed any shackles from posting guidelines.</div>

I guess the only real takeaway is that we're living in their heads rent free, I've never visited that subreddit even once, but I'm banned from it. I've already won, and I didn't even know it.</div>
