    <div class="md">Further details, copied from the OP:


The paper in question was the highly controversial APA guidelines for treating men, which pointed to "masculinity ideology", "oppression", "white privilege" and "patriarchy" as the causes of male mental illness. It's deconstructed [here](https://jordanbpeterson.com/political-correctness/comment-on-the-apa-guidelines-for-the-treatment-of-boys-and-men/), with links to the paper itself.

Left-wing reddit loved it because it epicly owned traditional masculinity with Logic and Facts(TM), but most of the paper was just political ideology based on shoddy, if not outright non-existent evidence.

When I pointed out that the work had a left-wing bias, so the controversy was "understandable", I was instantly banned with no recourse. Apparently ideological enforcement constitutes science these days, and criticising the ideology is "denialism".

Later I found this same mod in r/skeptic, saying that "all evidence supports the democrats' policies" (after claiming that he was a lifelong right-winger in this exchange, to cover his ass). What’s more outrageous is that, after permanently banning me for being skeptical of a paper he liked, and refusing to discuss it, repeatedly muting me from messaging the subreddit instead, he has the nerve to claim an association with skepticism. </div>

    <div class="md">It’s a shame when science gets confused with politics. In anthropology this was an issue that came up a lot, that in studying culture or critiquing culture there were dilemmas resulting from “privilege, race (white looking into nonwhite cultures), appropriation, etc” a good professor would immediately throw out these claims and point out that much of these discussions were political in nature and held no true weight in academic settings. In fact, even stunted anthropological research where results could cause a group to be offended. (A big example would be genetic proof of migration from tribes who believed they were “First Nation” and always existed in one place) many of those papers would be pressured into not being published due to the backlash it would cause. 
Or the pressure not to participate in ceremonies due to “appropriation” or the pressure not to write findings if you were white as it would be “observations from the oppressor” 
I genuinely love cultural anthropology and it taught me a great deal about human nature and the similarities that almost all cultures hold. However we risk losing much of those sciences simply on the belief that they are controversial in today’s political climate. </div>

    <div class="md">What a bunch of dishonest weasels.

This is happening all over the Internet.  Very similar tone and arguments used by the mods of /r/Canada.  

They won't allow "conspiracy theories".  But only they can decide what a conspiracy theory is.

Any criticism of our publicly funded news broadcaster CBC, and you're immediately banned.  But Trump and his Russian Trolls?  That's fine!  Go ahead!  Say whatever you want about that and you will never get banned.

It's rules for some, and other rules for others.</div>
