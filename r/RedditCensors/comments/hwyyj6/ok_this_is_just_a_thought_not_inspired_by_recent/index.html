A Replication of Policing Known to Be Agnostic as to Fabricated Pretense, in some, probably many, cases, symbiotic, problematic, as a result of that relationship; white woman says someone touched her, and if it's a man that a jury won't like- *yep,* and we know that this has been an enormous problem.  


In The Real World, *online,* any, I think, attempt to replicate something, so,   


Very Obviosly **Broken,** *so very obviously* ***built broken****,* is going to have the same problems, albeit, with fewer consequences and imho it's the substantially, enormously, fewer, permanent and irreperable consequences that make it so obvious:  


**"Why the Fuck Did That Just Happen?"- thousands of people, while the technicians, 'policing,' them remain as systemically agnostic to anything, 'outside of their purview,' e.g. the virtues and vices at play, including the possibility, that, as is common, the person most-willing to expose their own misdeeds is the person being wronged, and that the person who appears to be, 'innocent,' the most immediately, 'innocent,' appearing party, is. or, appears to be de to the performance of injured and the performance of having been at risk and the denial of any, possible, relativitiy, in play, you feel me?**  


Now, if we're going to be dorks about, and we are, and we're going to take Bertrand Russells, I think, very wise analysis of policy intended to fuck-you somebody, rather than, that, with kindly feelings, as he put it, that the fuck-you policy can only do harm, and that can not help anyone; I think he's right, and when something is this pernicious and dangerous and bad it can be hard not to want to fuck-you somebody but take a half-look at the scale of this misconception and you realize we're looking at something more like an unceasing culture-bound disorder masquerading as government-or-authority, an utterly massive error caused by cognitive dissonance and hallucinatory denial, *something really serious,* and so, I think, in taking it seriously we must act only with kindly feelings in terms of policies or changes to policies, *this, and very deliberately,* **as hard as that is to do.**  


But if we're going to be dorks about this?  


I think square one is to say: *the necessity of policing of adults has been overstated, and that we know that this was true of medieval europe as a justification of the condition of the serfdom, and that this is a western-mostly culture bound syndrome, by all appearances, and that this is spreading to china, for instance, and that the delusion goes like this,*  


A witchhunter will either never find a witch, or, something in the nature of investigating a stranger, especially, the dispassionate investigation of a stranger, will result in the appearance of a guilty party, when it is, in actuality, the production of what a westerner will take to be a criminal; production, here, to mean, "**manufacture**."   


That  premise is tripped, "true," a witchfinder can find a witch  
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew\_Hopkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hopkins)   
...so, I would suggest, that the statistical apparence of any-common crime of malfeasance- and I wouldn't dream of a closer analouge to the accusation of malfeasance known as *trolling,* online, to *witching, i*n reality; the bending of common laws of natural for one's own benefit, with disregard to the harm it brings to others?   


Yah, that's pretty, pretty, pretty,

...or should I say, 'gangs'er'n't" or actually, "I couldn't find the episode but those serve more-than-equally-well," and if you're unfamiliar with the theorists people are referring to when they say, *theorist,* you are...

...one modern equivalent of a plane ride away from from being an erudite chit chatter; which is great, and I love that those exist, as, someone who actually, in fact, reads that stuff- it's very much like what Russell says about *kindly feelings,* which, I'd bet he does in one of these two, and I'm sure that they are both worth listening to,

....that one doesn't want to talk about Foucault to make someone else feel stupid, not least it's about the most difficult work one can do for no better purpose than can be accomplished by calling them *fucking retarded,* something else on the euphemism treadmill, but that's now beside the point; did you hear him say, "*people of asia need to understand that the Russians are White Men,"* and if you cringed for him?  


  
No, nope, no: he's warning them,  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HyKxV2OCkM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HyKxV2OCkM)   


You should listen to this whole thing, and I say that as a person who has kindly feelings both for you, as a person, interested in this subject, and as a person involved with this cause:  


It is plainly apparent that if the Censors were called to interdict when Russell said, W*hite, Black, Yellow,* that an analyses, no matter how detailed, of this  


Could not prove his innocence, but that this,  


Written thirty years earlier would not only throw open the doors of any prison you put him in, for that crime, *it would fucking condemn his interviewer, should a world-famous intellectual's fairly uncontroversial analyses of America at that time be taken seriously,* were this a jury trial, one would *demand to see the cut footage,* and after listening to that audiobook, as you, either have or will do if you're interested enough in the subject matter, *that being censorship, primarily,* you'll agree with me: I know exactly what's on the cutting room floor, don't you?  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL\_sMXfzzyA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL_sMXfzzyA) 

**That Interviewer Go Gulag**

...in any earnest analyses, taking into account more than the conditions of the condemenation, but the virtues and vices and nature of those people more generally; the one who is anodyne is the guilty, sinner, whatever, *this is obvious.*  


Except: equally obvious from a dorky-look-at-this is that the anodyne fellow is the one calling the cops; the colorful one, the Russell, he's not, he's never, and it is the statistical inflation of the crime's commonality equal to how often the anodyne fellow calls the cops which is most pernicious and most justifies an overapplication of unnecessary force almost always being used incorrectly, in fact, *probably only without incident when it is applied incorrectly,* applied correctly, one might presume, *could easily lead to the failure of the process, of manufacture, the Russell never makes an accusation or counter-claim so there is no manufactured criminal so something isn't right in these instance*,  


Or, at least, I would presume; two things, no, three:  


1.) it an invariable and realily, easily, terrifically, such-and-such fact that   


**Western European Magical Thinking Has Not Been Predated Upon**

Western Europeans have preyed upon the people of the whole-wide-world, mostly, but not exclusively, no, by no means exclusively, but mostly, by walking them into the trap of magical thinking and then robbing them blind, killing them, raping them, doing all manner of awful things; no other group of people on earth has done something so cruel so commonly, as a system, even, Capitalism is the Formal Name for this, in many, respects, take a look,

Magical Thinking as long as they want to.  


Point 2, *this is at a traumatic dissonance from how the perpetrators see the world, and one must not dismiss their empathy for these people, lest, they lose their ability to see what they see;* we should not be Brutalitarians about this, even if we could kill them all, which we can't, though,

That's your premise for a white genocide, right there, were you in search of one; one shouldn't be, that won't work and it fix anything; one's gotta work on a way to walk them out of this, that's the only solution that sets us all free.  


Point three, this is an account wherein I'm deliberately, and also because I want to, but also, deliberately, crossing the streams of my life as if I would not wish to hide them; is that not right, u/hellen5110 because I do not think that Sexuality is Sinning, seeing as, Flowers do it to, and, Honeybees use their ovopositors for something efficacious as hell and no doubt inovated at some point in honey bee history by an absolutely fucking insane siser bee, and, look what we got for that: **Honey**!  


How wonderful; **we can be certain that the medieval catholics were wrong, from these two facts alone**, and that is **all we can be certain of,** and that, meine freunde, is some pretty compelling evidence that yet another reason for these censors has been poof,

Now: **I linked you to that Wiktionary article so that it might be plainly obvious that no searching or superstition is required**, simply, that's a bad alley, it doesn't work like that it's how they think, *and also people who look like myself/and/or/bjork are not white people we're just pale imho it's obvious that people look a certain way from iceland to Kazakhstan to japan for a reason ffs,* but whatever; more productive,

You hear that, what he said about Americans Winning a War against Japan, as if it would be the Actual Apocalypse, that it would be the death of all culture on earth that can't be hung on the wall of a ranch house?  


His terms there, that's his zinger; Russell studied Hanzi, Russel had a nuanced perspective on these issues and fucking hated American Whites.

.....snooping on a woman's sex life and making a pillory of her?  


"I need to investigate further"- male policeman, do you feel me?  


Do we not, plainly, very obviously, ***know that because it is so pernicious, that it is not the relationships, in question, that are a criminal violation of another person's right to independent agency? That the commonality of the behavior actually suggests that the persecutions are criminal?***  


We are **not fallen sinners, in real life, that is not true.**  


Add everything like that to the pile of, "statistical inflation of the occurence of *crime-as-such,*  


Consider that this isn't fucking dealt with, *so maybe almost-none-real-crime is,*  


...but merely consider the paradox enough to justify considering the inflation, and *wow,* yah.  


Anyway, roundabout ways of saying,  


1. This is at an even higher order of complexity than I'm suggesting, here, and any understanding of it is going to benefit from an-ever-higher-still attempt  

2. To Convince someone complicit in this tha they're doing it would be, like, a *holy shit I wish I was dead*, thing, rather than something casual, so, bear that in mind and take that seriously, *lest,* ya know; you're people, you've got hearts, mine's 10,000,000 years old and heartstrings stretched all to fuck *but I still don't like to hurt people I don't intend to end-as-active-agents;* then, I only do it if I enjoy it, which is actualyl a pretty good policy; no, for real, your body won't lie to you about that, it's not fun to hurt people you don't intend to through imme untergang  

3. I mean,  I'll say, *I'm ambivalent to this going viral*, but u/hellen5110, who has nothing to be ashamed of and so could only benefit, as I see it, from some exposure to an anti-censorius crowd of healthy happy people who do not begrudge others for their beautiful self, could, probably surmise that I mean *more like I'd prefer quite strongly that it didn't but I'd take it as a test of character if it did and so*
