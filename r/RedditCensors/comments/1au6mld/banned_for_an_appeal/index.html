    <div class="md">The 70% mods work for a strategist company imo. They will ban for dissenting opinion then cite harassment if you disagree with them. They don't actually care about the ban at all. Only controlling the narrative. So arguing with them is pointless since they have no feelings towards anything other then pushing an agenda. If you ever get banned from a subreddit there is no point in engaging with a bad faith mod. 

Also when disagreeing with people you can't call them any names even if they are calling you names. Since they will use their buddies to report for harassment. Like 50 of their accounts vs your one account will always lose.   But you can definitely argue with them and make them look dumb long as you don't call them names directly.</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit moderators, in their quest for a fleeting sense of power and usefulness, often find themselves compelled to issue bans and engage in censorship even when there is no justifiable reason to do so. This desperate need for control, driven by the fear of experiencing severe withdrawals, is a sobering reminder of just how temporary and insubstantial this illusion of influence truly is. As soon as they return to the reality of their daily lives, the instant gratification from their perceived authority dissipates, leaving them craving for their next fix in the digital realm.</div>
