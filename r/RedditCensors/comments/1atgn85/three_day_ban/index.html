    <div class="md">We don't have a mental health problem. This shooting was facilitated because two different people had a run of the mill disagreement, and in the heat of the moment, they were able to escalate this run of the mill disagreement involving disrespect and whatever into a shooting match.

We are the only country in the world with that.

In KC, the rest of the story is:

* Police have been on soft-strike for a while because one of their officers was convicted and put in jail for shooting an unarmed minor in a botched home invasion raid.
* The state and local governments have all but given up trying to enforce drug laws, gun laws, and anything else. 
* Municipal government and police have been corrupt since the city was founded, and it's basically always been a lawless shithole.</div>

    <div class="md">1. There are virtually no gun control laws whatsoever in effect in KC, and none that are actually enforced. There is no mechanism to prevent transfer of guns, no requirements for example for annual inspections, etc. 
2. The police have come out and confirmed no gang affiliations at all.

This is, as you, say, two random shits who knew each other beefing over disrespect. It escalated because one knew where the other was going to be (parade), they hard words, and it erupted into gunfire. This happens all the time. 

People such as yourself wish it was just as easy to write off most/virtually all gun violence as "gang related", like organized crime where one party ordered an attack on the other, but the actual on the ground reality is that this is self-organizing chaos that develops from small scale arguments.

KC has been a shit-hole for this type of thing for decades, and with the recent soft-police strike, there is virtually no enforcement whatsoever.

The actual number of gang members is much smaller than most people in the larger world think. The anti-gang taskforce in KC estimated there are about \~110-150 \*total\* gang members in the KC area. 

For sure they are involved in lots of crime, but no where near the number that people (such as yourself) push on them.

I.e. even in areas with no gang activity whatsoever, there's massive gun violence problems. A great example: Little Rock. One of the most dangerous cities in the country, literally no gangs. Kalamazoo, Michigan, a top 10 dangerous city in the US, no gangs. 

Passing the gun violence problem off on gangs is just not the case. Vast majority of  gun crimes are not mass shootings, and vast majority of  gun crimes are not gang related.</div>

    <div class="md">This is just totally false.

Do a thought experiment: do some countries have less gun crime than the US? Is that random luck, or the result of policy?

You are 100% correct that criminals don't follow the law. Agree totally. The two minors involved in this gun crime: they didn't follow the law.

The problem is that their were no other criminals made in the process of them obtaining guns: they were the only ones who had to break the law to get the guns they used for this shooting.

The entire chain of gun control from the source is loose in the US, and that's why people who criminally engage in shootings can always get guns.

It was legal for the gun store to sell the gun to a straw buyer, it was legal for that person to transfer the gun without records, it was legal for them not to report that the gun wasn't in their care. It was legal for the ammo to be sold to a straw buyer.

This isn't rocket science:

1. All gun transfers are reported to the ATF for central record keeping.
2. Every gun is registered to a natural person owner, or a government agency.
3. You receive a gun transfer, it's registered to you until it is destroyed by a gun dealer or the police, or you record a transfer to another party. Every year, your local police department comes to inspect your gun, ensure that it is locked up, safe, and accounted for.
4. If your local police can't inspect your gun, it is assumed you illegally transferred it, and you go to jail for 5 years.
5. If you are in possession of a gun that isn't registered to you, you go to jail for 5 years.

That's it. The US will go from a homocide rate in 4.x to 5.x per 100,000 rate, to under 1.x per 100,000 just like all the other civilized countries in the world.

Gun people can still have guns. You can still have a huge arsenal. You can still open-carry. You can still have all the 2A rights you have today.

And people can go to a parade without worrying about being shot in the fucking face.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude, it doesn't go over anyone's head. First of all, everything he said is totally wrong. It is illegal to sell to a straw purchaser, it is illegal to straw purchase, and it is illegal to buy a gun with the intent to give it to someone who isn't allowed to have it. And if you think having the police "inspect" your guns or any of your property every year then there's just no getting through to you. That's bootlicking of the highest order. Why is every "common sense" gun control law totally brain dead? Calling something common sense doesn't make it suddenly not stupid.</div>

    <div class="md">Lmao, god damnit here I go engaging with an idiot… 

It may be illegal to do those things, in some areas, because I know for damned sure I can go to a local gun show and buy whatever the fuck I want with no paperwork to say I now own that gun, but like the original comment said, if there’s no laws that allow you to ENFORCE the laws that already exist…

The best way to do that is a registry. And routine inspections from LEOs. IF you want to keep all your guns without restrictions on what you can purchase and still have concealed carry; which I fuckin’ do. 

If you’re afraid of the police, maybe you’re not a “good guy with a gun”. 

Here’s a satirical article a decade old that’ll probably go over your head ‘dude’. 

[‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens](https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527)

Enough idiot engagement for me. Have fun whatever else rubbish you have to say cause I got better things to do than respond to comments and I’m done wiping my ass.</div>

    <div class="md">Two minors had illegally obtained firearms. So naturally people assume that they obtained the guns from the gang they’re in. Reasonable assumption. It’s not normal for teenagers to have handguns at all and it’s a testament to a fallen culture that these two had guns in the first place. This is aggravating on so many levels. Where did they get the guns should be a priority in this investigation.</div>

    <div class="md">Instead of telling you you're wrong like the other two replies, I'd like to ask you to elaborate.

What is a policy change that could be made that would achieve what you want? Do you think it would help stop issues where a confrontation that wouldn't otherwise escalate becomes deadly because guns are readily available in the situation? How?

How can we address the cultural and mental health issues as a society? What is a real policy change that you would support?</div>

    <div class="md">No the one you replied to, but drugs is a decent parrel. It's a cultural and mental health issue. Criminalizing clesrly didn't work. The answer is beyond complex and honestly the only answer I have is a *long*, deeply assisted issue over the course of decades.

There's been some sport stars that funneled a ton of money into their former/ current local communities with awful drug/ gang/ crime issues (mainly education, providing a light to a future, have a role model doing it, etc) that tends to have the best effect. Doesn't always work, but tends to be the best option.

Notice a lot of times that drugs, violence, etc tend to come from those that have that have lost "hope". The hard part, is "hope" is very unique to an individual and needs more of that approach than a blanket fix. In a country as large as the US (i.e Texas is bigger than most nations), it's a tall order.

Mainly getting at there's no "do x will fix it", and the governments approach via throwing money at *one thing* or criminalizing with an awful judicial system... that doesn't work. It's gotta be a small community at a time, and large cities, that's a really tough one. Let alone an entire state or federal. Education (especially public) has gone down the toilet, so that's probably the best place to start.. even that's complex as hell from a federal level. One community at time over many years is better than what were doing now, imo. Social media another? Idk how to begin to fix that one tho. 

Not trying to argue, just my 2cents to think about. That's all.</div>

    <div class="md">We should be addressing the root cause of the problem.

Why are teens suddenly choosing to commit extremely violent acts?

I'm in education, so this is a topic that is very important to me, not only because I might be shot, but because I want to help these kids.

All of the shooters have come from single parent households, with no father figure in their lives. (The one exception was an emotionally unavailable stepfather)
So let's start by trying to understand the connection between not having a father and the mental state leading to mass murder.</div>

    <div class="md">I didn't say anything about "abnormal" family or otherwise, just that if young teens don't have a father figure in their lives that it's harmful and seems to have a connection to school shootings.

Also, socioeconomic factors don't seem to have a connection to mass shootings, because not all of the shooters have been from struggling households. It seems that it's more lack of emotional support from those around them.</div>

    <div class="md">Respectfully this still isn't really a policy idea. I'm not doing this rhetorically as a way to make a point or argue. I just actually want an answer about any one thing that you would change that would address the issue. I'm not asking for a complete fix either. Surely no one thing would fix the problem.

What is one law you would change or program you would have the government pay for?</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly, I'm always a skeptic on government intervention, so I see that as a last resort, a kind of Hail Mary effort that's doomed to failure.

It would be better to work on building better social interconnect, more community based activity. The violence is caused by a feeling of lack of emotional support or the idea that no one cares for or about the individual. I believe that the only way to solve the problem is by removing the isolation and providing emotional support to the individual by other individuals.

One school that was experiencing extreme levels of bullying and criminal behavior from their students organized a group of around 60 fathers to come into the school in shifts to act as mentors and emotional outlets for the students. Negative behavior dropped almost immediately.

I don't think that there is one solution to this issue, and each community will have to work out what best fits their needs, because this is a problem that individuals are facing, not institutions.

Trying to ban or restrict the outcome rather than fixing the source is like trying to grab the wrong end of a baseball bat. Not only will it not work, but it will only result in more problems.</div>

    <div class="md">This all seems very hand-wavy and dangerously close to "we should do nothing"

You say that each community will have to work out what best fits their needs, but don't really offer a way for them to do that. If the volunteer father figure model worked then let's do that. Government or otherwise we should organize interventions like that with communities at schools across America.

That is something you can advocate for that is at least an actual action that could be taken. The government could reach out to communities and help them set up these events in a hands-off way that lets the community figure out the best way to do it for them with minimal guidance. Would you support that?</div>

And keep the personal attacks out if you want to sound credible.

So, I've already directly quoted you to you before, but "it's the guns always has been," does seem to mean that it's the guns, yeah?

Like if the guns went away then the violence would magically evaporate! We *definitely* wouldn't have poison gas attacks like Japan or serial knife murder like both Japan and England.</div>

Which all required extensive fucking work on the behalf of the terrorists. How we have guns now makes it just easier to get a firearm and shoot people rather than do a gas attack.</div>

    <div class="md">We could look at the US prior to the 80’s.  Guns have been a major feature in American life since the beginning of the nation.  Yet the violence didn’t really kick off until the 80s; at least in terms of mass shooting events. Could have something to do with the import of drugs into the inner cities by the Federal government that destroyed the dynamic of the nuclear family, especially in minorities. Or maybe the mass prescriptions of MAOIs and other psychotropic drugs to children, especially young boys, because the Department of Education was formed and standardized the education system around girls which created the myth that boys who couldn’t pay attention to the boring ass lectures needed to be drugged into submission.  Or maybe it’s the removal of Christian values and practices under the idiotic misinterpretation of our Freedom OF (not from) religion.</div>

    <div class="md">Personally I would also add influence from media like news reporting on these tragedies constantly and also the reclassification as well the the very broad definition of a mass shooting adding to the skyrocketing numbers. Like the past events of when news stations actively reported on suicides which lead to even more suicides back in 2000, who's to say with massive media coverage on these shootings that they aren't creating copycats who want to have their names released and become infamous or inspire people for ways to "get back" at the people who wronged them. Those mass shooting numbers are also very scary since the classification of what is a mass shooting can go by two different definitions, one from the FBI which is just any person who is actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people a populated area. You know, like gang violence in the cities. Or the definition that the media uses when it can of mass killings of 3 more more fatalities in a single incident. The latter which was put in place by the Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2012 and used by everyone who created the skewed shooting numbers, because why is it that the media reports shootings like an hourly occurrence but when one actually happens they stick to the story for at least a week?</div>

    <div class="md">There's so much wrong with this I can't even begin to describe it in the short free time I have. Suffice to say:

1.) ADD and ADHD are very real things that have axrual effects on people. You being ignorant of that doesn't change it. 

2.) Your pet religion being foisted on others does not lead to net benefits for society. If you want evidence, see pretty much all of human history. 

3.) Freedom of religion necessitates freedom from it. This is not difficult to understand. Your superstitions are not anyone else's business or problem.</div>

    <div class="md">So you're just going to ignore all the plane hijackings in the 70s and organized crime of the early 1900s or the bandit gangs of the western settler period... and blame everything on kids not having dads? Not on the economic policies that strained the families in those cities, which mostly affected poc, or how since Reagan the financial plan has been to tax the poor more heavily and the targeting of welfare programs because of the strawman "welfare queens", or the tax breaks we gave to mortgage holders, or the lobbying power we give to corporations and pacs.

No one is attacking your right to worship Christ, but every time other religions try to worship in public, it's "OMG, we are under attack. " I hate to break the news, but that constitutional right also protects other religions (or lack thereof) from you.</div>

Plane hijackings are not mass shootings.  Racketeering, bootlegging, smuggling, etc are not mass shootings.  I never said there wasn’t crime before the 80s. I said the mass shooting problem wasn’t a problem until then. 
There IS a direct correlation between fatherlessness and violent crime.  The mass shooting phenomenon arose at the same time as increased fatherlessness, massively increased psychotropic drug prescriptions (many of which have side effects like “violent impulses, psychosis, thoughts of suicide, etc.), and removal of religious materials and practices from public education; as well as a rise in atheism and agnosticism.  
Poor people today have considerably more than poor people of the early 1900s and before.  In 1981 it was estimated that 42% of the world lived in abject poverty. By 2013 that number had fallen to 10%.  So if anything, people have gotten wealthier since the 80s. 
What other religions are being “attacked for public worship?”</div>

    <div class="md">Yes I was already on this page.  Ignoring the fact the Wikipedia is updated by Left wing activists.  There were 2 before 1966 that weren’t attributed to politics or personal feuds.  1966 was the University of Texas Tower shooting and the Rose-Mar College shooting. The tower shooter, Charles Whitman, wrote in his suicide note that he was experiencing “unusual and irrational thoughts”.  There has been speculation that he may have been a subject of the MK Ultra project.  The Rose-Mar shooter was a copycat.
In the 70’s you had the Olean school shooting, the CSU Fullerton shooting (the shooter there was a paranoid schizophrenic), and the Cleveland Elementary School shooting (you can read about that nut job if you like).  Everything else in the 70s was related to organized crime or family violence. 
Enter the 1980s.  There are suddenly way too many to list out as I just did for the 60s and 70s. 
Pretty sure you just got owned by your own source.</div>

    <div class="md">"Left wing activists" why don't you just go use conservapedia if all you want is an echo chamber....

They defined the term in 1949. there is no data for this type of crime before that. So you trying to move the goalposts is telling. You said it wasn't a problem before the 80s. There are several examples right there that you are not being accurate. If you can't accept a correction and admit you're human then there is no point to continuing this farce.</div>

    <div class="md">No no.  I’m fine with your echo chamber in this instance. 
Again you are straw manning. I said it wasn’t a problem until the 80s.  I didn’t say it never occurred until the 80s.  If someone has a beer a couple of nights a week, they don’t have a drinking problem.  If they down a fifth of whiskey every night, now they have a drinking problem.  There were 5 instances between 1960 and 1980 that would fit the framework of a modern mass shooting. There were 6 from 1988-1989.</div>

    <div class="md">Rates of gun violence have steadily been declining other than a brief jump due to Covid. The government keeps redefining what is a “mass shooting” and the media just started covering it more. Maybe we should stop changing the goalposts because the numbers are getting better, not worse.</div>

    <div class="md">Are you fucking retarded? I’m sorry, I’ll engage in a debate with anyone who can grasp even the most basic point of an argument but this one is just beyond the pale.  I said that guns have always been around but mass shootings weren’t really a thing until the 1980s. And from that you got, “It’s been a thing for so long that we shouldn’t change it.”  Please tell me you’re a bot.</div>

I'm not recommending anything about speech here so I don't know what you're on about other than "America best - must say vague thing that is bad about other countries unga bunga"</div>

    <div class="md">I’m sorry. I grew up in a really shitty neighbourhood. The drug dealers in our neighbourhood were not from the area, always traveled armed, always had another with them. Trying to hold up a crackhouse is equally dumb. Also going to result in you either dying, or being cut off. A beating might be considered instead, but I didn’t know many who actually cared about their clientele.</div>

    <div class="md">I live in a border town, we get tons of drug traffic. Nobody sensible goes after the dealer. we’ve had at least two drug homicides in the past 3 years.

One was someone who got shot by their dealer within a quarter mile of the police station, the other was a couple that shot their dealer and left him in a hotel pool cause they couldn’t afford the drugs.

Most crackheads learn to avoid violence, considering dealers don’t care about their clients.</div>

Only black people use cocaine? Putting people in prison for drug use works? The War on Drugs was a good idea? Really?

Ban all guns and watch firefights break out all across America. Just like happened with the War on Drugs, do you think people are going to be going quietly?  *Especially* because both sides are going to make it an idiological fight.

    <div class="md">The only reason it "worked" was because there are easier ways to get alternative drugs.

Go through history, look at all weapon bans and you'll see two things that are always constant. 1, they were promoted as being for the People's benefit, and 2, they always were about stripping the people of control or means to resist oppression.

If you treat the symptoms and not the cause (lack of emotional support and stability) then you can't get rid of the symptoms. Both Japan and England are facing epidemic levels of fatal stabbings. The violence won't go away until the source is taken care of.

Don't try to push your ideology on others if your own idea of things is screwed up enough to think that the War on Drugs was a good idea.</div>

    <div class="md">Japanese people are oppressed without handguns? Lol, no.

It's harder to kill dozens of kids with stabbings than with a handgun. The police and citizens are more likely to stop a guy with a knife than a guy with a gun.

The War on Drugs had both good and bad elements. It eradicated crack dealers substantially.</div>

    <div class="md">Frankly, I remember in California during a hearing about some gun control laws, the judge asked the state DA how long it took for people to get guns, the judge then revealed that he was waiting on his permit for over 6 months... Frankly, that proves that "gun control" laws do not have safety in mind, but instead "banning" in mind.</div>

    <div class="md">Gun control is more of a bandaid that goes on top of another bandaid that is sitting on top of another bandaid, and eventually on a festering wound that has gotten infected long ago. No amount of gun control is going to fix the problem as even if guns are outright banned it's just going to move to knives, then bats and hammers, pipes and planks, so on and so forth until even words are banned because they hurt people's feeling... Oh wait, that's already happening. The only thing gun control really does is disarm the law abiding citizens as criminals and the systems that facilitate the criminals continue to cause mayhem because as massive surprise CRIMINALS DON'T FOLLOW LAWS.

Instead of asking to remove the smell of the infected wound (gun violence) with more bandages we instead ask why there is a wound to begin with and work to actually stitch it up so it doesn't get worse with bigger problems.</div>

2A nuts are fucking insane. Yeah bro, you can take up a window position and fire on an entire crowd of innocents with a knife, bat or hammer. How stupid can you be?

> The only thing gun control really does is disarm the law abiding citizens

So test cases like... Every western country with gun control is just fake and made up to you? Facts don't care about your feelings, have you heard?

Honestly I hope your kid is at the next Uvalde so you can get some perspective on the matter.</div>

    <div class="md">Guns are the problem because people have unfettered access to them. And the people who aren't don't prevent the people who are.

This is why we can't have nice things.

Seriously, the people who demand unfettered access to guns are just as much the problem as people who actually pull the triggers unnecessarily. 

Put the guns in a chair and throw them both into the smelter, that's the only way to be sure they don''t harm an innocent person.</div>

    <div class="md">You feel tyranny? How?

I agree, we should take just about 99% of them. Nobody should really be trusted to unilaterally decide to end my life so easily. Even most police officers have no real need for a gun.

The tyrants in our system are voted out. Our Senate has more power than the President. 

The crisis we are facing is deliberate propaganda from foreign powers manipulating us on social media. Russia, for example, believes that we can be goaded into a race war. China is dumbing us down for generations to come with Tik Tok stupidity.

Australians turned in most of their guns after they came to their senses. We still have guys like Gov. Abbott offer prayers and condolences as the only solution to Uvalde.</div>

    <div class="md">I think you just answered your own question. We don’t disagree as much as you might think. But then there’s human nature and common sense to contend with. People will be people. No matter what. If you wanna see the true nature of people. Take two starving people. Truly starving. And toss a sandwich between them. Then watch what happens. Maybe they half it and both eat. But most likely. Someone’s getting fucked up. And someone’s getting a sandwich. Long way around the fence to say that people kinda suck. Inherently I think. Guns are a problem. But the earths only enemy is a bigger problem.</div>

    <div class="md">Wow. Wishing death upon the child of an "ideological opponent".

That will totally convince them, and not polarize them against you even further. You get more flies with honey than you do with nuclear waste.

God. Why do so many people think that being an inhumane scumbag will do any good for the world. You realize that being hateful will involve more hate. And it's typically the people on your "side" that always preach of the dangers of hate, and are always the first to point out when the other "side" is hateful.

And before you try to sort me into a little tribal box so that you can insult me better, No I'm not a Republican, and no I'm not an "Enlightened Centrist".

I'm just tired of the divisiveness and polarization that both parties purposely contribute to as to keep each other perpetually in power.

It's called manufactured outrage and manufactured consent. You're contributing to the problems our political system is facing with your vitriol and hate. But have fun convincing absolutely no one that you are right with your toxic attitude and rhetoric.</div>

    <div class="md">Here is my question, are they gonna track down how they got those guns and go after the entire chain? nope. I bet though you will hear people complain nonstop about gun laws not being enough.

When you enforce the law, then we can talk about the issue, until then enforce the law.</div>

    <div class="md">If a gun is used for a crime that was stolen from jimmy and jimmy never reported it? He should be charged for providing a weapon. We need strict liability on the owner of a weapon for any crime the weapon is used to commit. If a gun is stolen out of a car then the owner needs a hefty fine for supplying a gun to a criminal. Some things need to be fleshed out in that conversation but there are 1000’s of legal weapons that become illegal weapons every day because gun owners treat their guns like I treat my water bottles, carelessly.</div>

    <div class="md">So how come Canada, Mexico, and most of Scandinavia, who are all allowed to have firearms or, in the case of Mexico, just own them; why don't these places have the school shooting we do?   
    
The Philippines makes more ghost pistols than any other place in the world. No school shootings comparable to the USA.   
    
Hell even Russia, where you can easily get a gun - no school shootings on the level of the USA.   
Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary.   
    
It's a long list of countries that allow it's citizens to have guns that coincidentally also don't have our level of school shootings. People in these countries ( except perhaps Russia) are not living in a dictatorship where the SS guards are telling them how to live life.</div>

    <div class="md">Good news. There are laws that forbid minors, like this kid, having a gun. There are also laws against killing people, illegal use etc. Your argument suggests I should wear a bullet proof vest everywhere.  

Further, the difference is I don’t drive 50 in a school zone because others are in danger. That’s always the standard, I have rights until they encroach on others. My exercising rights is not encroaching on others. 

I would argue that me wearing a seatbelt is something the government really has really stepped outside their purview on. Sort of like making motorcycle riders wear helmets. It affects no one but me so why should people be compelled to wear them?  Having said all of that it’s dumb not to wear either and you should but it’s not really affecting others. 

And before you mention it Insurance actuary tables are not something I consider when figuring out if it is my right to do or not do.</div>

    <div class="md">>There are laws that forbid minors, like this kid, having a gun.

They're clearly inadequate since incidents like this aren't even that rare.

What other societal issues do you suggest we give up on? Driving accidents? cancer?

>have rights until they encroach on others. My exercising rights is not encroaching on others. 

Misusing or mishandling guns ABSOLUTELY impacts others. Any gun safety training should teach you this, and any responsible gun owner should understand it.

>wearing a seatbelt is something the government really has really stepped outside their purview on.

Lots of right leaning types think this, and they're demonstrably wrong. Seat belts improve the safety of everyone, not just the person wearing them. A car with three secured passengers is endangered by a fourth unsecured one who can disrupt the driver or injure the others if they're jostled.

This kind of half-thought-out anti-government schtick is the reason libertarians are always the biggest victims of their own deregulation fervor (and it's also why all the anti-seat belt activists end up dying).</div>

    <div class="md">You’ve not demonstrated I’m wrong at all. In fact, you’ve made my point. Wishcasting a law that will keep this from happening is the logical fallacy that you’ve committed to. They are rights (there is a definition) and they are my rights. When other people violate people’s rights and their rights are taken away. No law is going to eradicate bad behavior and I do not have to answer for those who didn’t consult me before acting like a jackass. 

Your argument that misusing or mishandling guns affects others is not a point of contention. Of course, that harms others and people should not do this and further should take classes to learn proper gun safety. 

Life is not without its dangers. Thinking that you can ordain some law that will alleviate those dangers will never take the danger away nor totally eradicate them.  

The answer that you don’t want to hear is that our country needs to foster a culture of respect for each other and proper responsibility for our own actions. Once again, because a certain portion of our culture loves being cavalier with their rights isn’t something I feel obliged to have to answer for. 

Even if laws are passed people choose to follow them or not except your rights have been infringed. It never will be different.</div>

Yes you do. Every time you stop at a stop light, you do.

>Of course, that harms others and people should not do this and further should take classes to learn proper gun safety. 

These classes need to be mandatory and the responsible behaviors need to be backed up with enforcement. Otherwise it's an honor system and irresponsible people will ignore it.

>loves being cavalier with their rights isn’t something I feel obliged to have to answer for. 

You ARE answering for it. You answer for it with mass shootings, mass suicides, gang violence, and the increasing draconian security measures we put everywhere to put a bandaid on the problem.

>Even if laws are passed people choose to follow them or not except your rights have been infringed

This is an argument against all laws for everything. Imagine if we treated dynamite the same way.</div>

I learn gun safety for myself and for others. I don’t mind making people take gun safety courses. It is still a rights violation, mind you. 

We are talking in circles because you know I am right and I know you care about the consequences. I do too. 

The best you can do is make a law. People will choose to follow it or not. Thank goodness we had Founders that realized the government would regulate you into the ground or we would all have less liberty than we do.</div>

And there it is. You have the right to the gun but the training is optional.

This guarantees the untrained and incompetent will have guns. There's nothing sane about that. It's magical thinking, a chosen crisis.

> Thank goodness we had Founders that realized the government would regulate you into the groun

Look up the founders and gun control sometime. They confiscated guns constantly. It's only in the last 30 years or so that the conversation has shifted so far that any obstruction to gun ownership became unacceptable.</div>

Things like dynamite, deadly virus samples, nuclear material, and guns. Minimum standards of behavior and respect are required to mitigate the public risks, and these standards can't be on an honor system because dishonorable people won't bother.

None of this is in conflict with the constitution. It is just sanity. the founding fathers confiscated guns from civilians all the time because of the risk posed.</div>

    <div class="md">Where is that specifically a constitutional right? Knives while a smaller threat to the masses, are just as deadly. Do we need to take psychiatric evaluations to buy and keep those too or are we just going to do what the UK does and ban those as well? Can you cite a correlation between depression and anxiety to mass shootings? Yes people that commit mass shootings are mentally ill but banning anyone or taking weapons from people that have any amount of mental issues is an extremely slippery slope. It's shocking that you would want to give a government that much power to discriminate.</div>

    <div class="md">You're obviously ignoring all of history if you really think the government won't take every opportunity to suppress rights. What's your definition of mental illness as a qualifier? Is a diagnosis of anything from eating disorders to mild depression enough for you? What other rights can be legally chilled because of your comfort. Do we suppress the mentally ill's right to freedom of speech or how about their 4th 5th or 6th amendment rights? You still haven't answered the question, where is your "right to feel safe" codified in any law or constitutional right?</div>

    <div class="md">It’s in the 9th amendment. Just because a right isn’t codified doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. American citizens most certainly have a right to feel safe in public spaces. 

What history am I ignoring? The one where we created a government for the people by the people. If you don’t like something the government is doing it’s within your power to enact change. I think that’s amazing and why I love America.</div>

Answer me this. Why are guns use by police as an excuse to use lethal force? And if guns are used as protection against a tyrannical government who decides when the goverment has become tyrannical? When am I in my right to use said gun against the goverment?</div>

I mean, you probably don’t actually want that, but that’s what is going to happen.</div>

    <div class="md">What gets blamed after every mass shooting?

Mental healthcare.

Mental illness and guns don't mix. Full stop. If you can't pass a screening proving your competence, you shouldn't own a gun.</div>

    <div class="md">That doesn't address my point. What happens to people who already passed this mental health screening and already own guns, but later develop a mental health condition? Your idea discourages them from seeking help. 

Also not all "mental illness" makes someone dangerous. ADHD is a mental illness. You should be more specific about which types of mental illnesses you think should disallow someone from owning guns. It isn't obvious.</div>

There is no ban on the federal government from tracking guns with computers, in fact California (I think it was there) "accidentally" leaked all the owners of firearms in their state once.</div>

    <div class="md">Gun laws are not strict enough due to third party sales and gun shows that make it all to easy to get a gun that can't be traced through the line back to you. The problem is the laws are not as good as your comment would imply they are. It's so easy to get these guns that people from neighboring countries (latin American ones) are buying them off the black market from people who buy them here and take them there. Our gun problem is so shitty it makes other countries have gun problems.</div>

    <div class="md">I couldn’t disagree more, but the discussion is about enforcement. The cops have borderline unlimited budgets and numbers that eclipse whole military’s. The could easily shut down the illegal switches at the source or at the end use IF they wanted to, but they don’t. They don’t really care about gang wars, innocent bystanders, or anything like that. Easier to hand out speeding tickets and fish for some loose cash you can seize so your department can buy a margarita machine.</div>

    <div class="md">Your argument isn't congruent. The proper argument would be to ban all alcohol and severely punish those who persist.

An accidental death from a traffic accident also isn't the same as the intentional use of a gun to shoot somebody.

The supposed benefit of an armed society can be achieved without guns, we live in an age where cameras can deter and apprehend criminals.

Our justice system needs to refocus on removing violent people for longer periods and less about non-violent crimes.

The rioters, looters, insurrectionists, all of them should be in prison for years. Same for the assaulters and rapists, and murderers, ofc.</div>

    <div class="md">Well yes because the last time we outright banned alcohol that worked out just fine. Also banning alcohol wouldn’t stop others from using their vehicle as a deadly weapon or stop them from driving under the influence of another drug so the only sensible option is to get rid of every car in the world. Also cameras don’t stop criminals if it did we wouldn’t have so many criminals on tape doing illegal things. Your persistence on dying on a hill that is essentially “bend me over big daddy government please give me more boots to lick I trust you” is wild</div>

    <div class="md">According to who? You? Who is this we that do not use nor need guns? Because the majority of people do need them whether that’s for self defense, hunting, or keeping them or what the 2A is actually meant for. Just because YOU believe they aren’t needed now does that mean you will never need them? I guess I should just throw away my spare tires since I don’t need them now and I’m a safe driver so I will never need it and everyone else should also just get rid of their tires. Better yet just throw away the cars like I said I don’t need to use a car right now so I will never need it right?</div>

You do know that we have the right to bare arms in case the government becomes tyrannical so please explain how defending yourself from a tyrannical government isn’t self defense because if you could read you would notice how I used self defense(usually meant as individual self defense and not defense against a government) and 2A separately yet you still tried to conflate the two unsuccessfully. But hey if you aren’t using that spare tire then you are just a danger to me and everyone else around if you don’t give it up y out will need to be arrested for treason</div>

I'm not conflating anything.

If you need to take up arms against the U.S. gov't, you would already be an outlaw and don't need the 2A to allow you to do that.

Explain how Ukraine, with bigger guns than what the 2A allows, is still having trouble against Russia. You think your Smith and Wesson and AR-15 is gonna stop the M4s and drones that the imaginary war the US would start against its own citizens would involve?</div>

You did. I mean terribly but you still did.

Well by the sounds of it if they broke down your door the only thing you would do is ask what flavor boot polish they have on I hope you have no one that depends on you.

Man what a point Ukraine should just give up go in Russian control because guns don’t work I also agree no more money should be wasted on that war still has nothing to do with the US</div>

    <div class="md">You are correct you don’t but you should and the fact you are already willing to roll over even in a made up scenario says a lot about you as a person.

Do you think a man in a tie or a woman in a pant suit is bulletproof?

You believe they should just roll over though since guns won’t stop Russia therefore Ukraine should just fold and give up.

To believe violence will not be necessary in order to create or maintain a “civil” society shows not only ignorance but also cowardice. You are far too old to speak to others about the future when you got like what 3 days left? Of course it wouldn’t matter to you if everyone else falls into an actual dystopia you have no skin in the game and therefore no leg to stand on</div>

    <div class="md">No, what I am saying is that personal guns don't win a civil war nor repel a modern invader.

If the U.K. and the USA and NATO stop funding and arming Ukraine, they lose to Russia in a matter of weeks. Has nothing to do with .22s and .45s. Or hunting rifles.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh yes the classic “money solves everything” viewpoint. I’m sure the Ukrainians are just chucking nickels at the Russians. Like it or not but GUNS are being used to repel the Russians we are sending money primarily for weapons and ammunition well at least that’s what it’s supposed to be going for. Why not just take the Ukrainians guns? How do their guns stop nukes and tanks?</div>

Anything less than an AK or M4 has no bearing.

People who advocate illegal gun ownership of machine guns are a danger to our civil society and need to be locked up before they go to Vegas and kill people from a high-floor suite.

    <div class="md">Sure I am bro like I’m the one saying the best way to defend yourself from oppression is to go along with it

If the law was changed it wouldn’t be illegal gun ownership. Wanting to update the law is NOT the same as advocating for breaking the law or are you too stupid to understand that? 

Go ahead and report me for nothing you dope. The irony of you calling anyone a coward is hilarious when you openly admit to being the bitch of whoever has a gun near you</div>

Never said that, nor could a person in touch with reality conclude that.

Which also makes you dangerous with any gun based on your paranoia about the government being "tyrannical".

    <div class="md">So you must have forgotten where I said I advocate for the changing of gun laws because I believe those guns to be well within what the 2A was made for. You must also have forgotten where you used those exact guns as a defense as to how Ukraine can defend itself from Russia before changing your mind and thinking they are tossing quarters at the enemy.

Where did I say a single glock would stop it? My god you are a dense old one aren’t you. When your plan to fight oppression isnt “just let them do it to you and thank them afterwards” like useless coward then I will take what you say with more than half a grain of salt until then good luck doing nothing for no one</div>

Make whatever case you want, I simply don't like misinformation.

    <div class="md">Except we do.... We add more traffic lights, we add stop signs, we put police officers in that area to monitor the area for speeding, or put up DUI check points there, and we have drivers licenses and tests to make sure people should be allowed to drive and are capable of being safe. 
There are a lot of things we do to prevent dangerous areas of traffic. You can't get it to zero but you can do things to prevent them and we do them. But with guns people refuse to even do this, it's literally the whole doing the same shit and expecting different results thing with guns.</div>

    <div class="md">Are you proposing that all guns should have to be registered and regularly inspected? That gun owners should be required by law to be insured for any potential damage and/or loss of life that results directly or indirectly from the use of their guns? That guns should be restricted to only certain areas, with their registration numbers always visable, and that entire segments of the police should spend their time doing nothing more than monitoring gun owners to ensure compliance with the law? All this among the dozens of other regulations that are placed on cars?

If so, you're a stronger proponent of gun control than any politician in this country.</div>

    <div class="md">No it's a gun control issue. It works in every other country, it will never be absolutely perfect you can't get the sum to 0, but every other country with gun laws does not have any problem remotely close to what America has. Hell just limiting how much ammo can be held in a clip, how fast a gun can fire, and adding extra levels of process to obtaining a gun would go a far way to lessening the amount of injuries and deaths in this country.</div>

    <div class="md">Do those countries have low gun violence because of gun control, or have they always had low levels of gun violence, even when they had essentially zero gun control?

Take a look at England: 120 years ago they had practically no gun control laws, and today they have some of the strictest gun control systems in Europe.  Despite that, the murder rate is essentially unchanged between 1900 and today.</div>

    <div class="md">Regardless of whether or not the criminal has a gun, the potential victim is at an advantage having a gun. I’ve watched countless videos where police use a taser to almost zero effect on a large or drug fueled criminal. And I’m just going to reject the premise that everyone should have to spend the time and money for martial arts training just to be able to safely navigate society or protect their home.</div>

    <div class="md">No, they are not.

The criminal has the advantage and initiative because they have a gun.

If you don't want to spend the time to be safe, then safety isn't the concern. It's the love of the gun.

And if I know you are armed and I'm still intent on committing the crime, I'm going to kill you first.

Tell me how the 2A protects spouses from being shot by their spouses?</div>

    <div class="md">Illegal shootings are spiking. This is not a gun problem, but a societal one. In high school in the 80’s, we were allowed to have guns in the car at school. Why weren’t there rampant shootings like today? It was the same when I was in college in the early 90’s, where we were allowed to have them inside the building. 

I’m very sorry people are told they have no hope because they’re the wrong color, the planet is burning, you have to look like Barbie because the latest Tik Tok person does, or whatever bullshit is being peddled that makes someone desperate enough to shoot innocent people, but none of that removes any of one’s rights to constitutionally protected methods of protection.</div>

If enough voters want to change that, I hope they’ll first learn the histories of Germany, China, Soviet Union, Turkey, Uganda, and more.

    <div class="md">The 2A needs to be amended.

You are being fed propaganda the NRA to promote gun sales, a billion-dollar industry. 

None of those countries was a healthy and wealthy democracy like ours.

Personal firearms do not prevent government tyranny. Voting out bad actors does.</div>

    <div class="md">No. It would take a repeated effort of fine-tuning policy.

Once many gun nuts realize they won't qualify to own a gun, they won't want anyone else to either.

A blanket ban wouldn't occur immediately, if ever. And only if a majority voted in representatives to do that.</div>

    <div class="md">Let’s take the previous example of the woman being stalked. She has to submit what? Witness accounts, phone records, video surveillance, visible bodily injuries for review? And how long does that take? She might be dead tomorrow and she’s told to wait weeks, months? Multiply her case by tens of millions of others to be reviewed and decided by whom? Who’s responsible if she’s murdered after being denied?</div>

    <div class="md">Useless against what? A gun?

How about we catch the criminal with the gun and confiscate BEFOREHAND, and put him in jail for 15 years?

Cops do this all the time. Yet those guns are usually "legal" and let go, or only punished lightly when not.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, more propaganda and false rhetoric, Buddy.

The majority of women in the United States left the house without a handgun today and were not a victim of any crime.

They are more likely to be shot by a boyfriend, husband, or other acquaintance, or a stalker, than use a handgun in any form of self-defense.

Even women who armed themselves against stalkers become victims, because the stalkers have had legal access to firearms.</div>

Pepper spray sucks ass, but you can fight through it for a while. 

I personally have nothing against martial arts, but it takes a good 5-10yrs of training to be any sort of combat efficient. I would not advise sending a yellow/orange belt into a knife fight lol.</div>

    <div class="md">Wait, what? We have nearly 400 million guns in this country. A vanishingly small number of those firearms are used to commit violent, let alone murder. In other words, even counting suicides,, not even 1% of the firearms are involved with deaths. Its not even .05%. Its not even .02%.

If you think that the number of guns in this country is why there are *so many* gun-related deaths, then you'd think there'd be an even far greater number.

We have more gun violence and violence, generally, than most other nations because we dont operate a police state or a surveillance state, because our culture is far more violent than almost all other nations.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok, so now youre shifting from the volume of guns to talking about an increase in gun violence. Besides, until the pandemic, [gun violence had been trending down since 1993https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/trends-and-patterns-firearm-violence-1993-2018](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/trends-and-patterns-firearm-violence-1993-2018) and since 2021 has gone back to trending down. So, IM not sure what data youre looking at, but youre just wrong on the basic fact.

You say that, "Not true. The increase in gun violence is directly proportional to the spike in guns the NRA promoted with "Obama is gonna take your guns away".

We do live in a "police state" of surveillance", but you offer no evidence of this.  Your assertion, "Our violence is directly tied to gun culture" doesnt support the preceding statement and is, itself, an unsubstantiated assertion.

Actual mass killings are exceedingly rare in the US notwithstanding the news media's and special interest groups attempts to classify 2 or more injuries as a mass violence events here in the US. The vast majority of multi-victim incidents are crime-related and not involving real mass killing events. No reasonable person believes that theres a mass shooting event or more per day in the US despite the special interests and news media attempts to brainwash into thinking as much.</div>

    <div class="md">Criminals have access to guns because guns are widely distributed, legally. Crime-related gun violence IS the problem. Are you arguing that those stats don't qualify? What is a "non-crime-related" mass shooting?

Rare is a vague term. Too many to allow 18-year olds loners and aging nutcases to buy AR-15s.

The brainwashing is from the NRA. We are less safe with unregulated gun markets.</div>

    <div class="md">Well, Japan it's from the gun control.

You have to prove you can actually aim the gun. You have mental health checks. You are required to use a safe and you get a frandom inspection every few years to make sure you're actually USING the safe.

So a kid taking dad's gun and shooting 9 kids is unheard of. Some years they have 1 shooting.</div>

    <div class="md">They most certainly did not.   England's 'first' school shooting was in the 18th century.

The UK has reached the point that they're trying to ban *knowing* about knives, in order to combat violent crime.  Having knowledge is now a terrorist act.

Think about that for a moment.</div>

    <div class="md">So if America had Mexican levels of gun control, would America look more like Mexico when it comes to gun violence, or would it look more like Europe?  Keep in mind, there are approximately 500 million guns in circulation in the United States, most of them owned legally.  Making those guns illegal will create a flourishing black market (even more so than it is right now) which will be violent and deadly.</div>

    <div class="md">Your entire argument hinges on the proposition that guns would be outright outlawed, or that all of those guns in circulation would become contraband, which is not the case, people in England, Australia and indeed all of these places which we seek to model their gun control have plenty of legal gun ownership, with the most stringent requirements for the average person being a legal reason to own one, which usually includes both sport and self defense.</div>

    <div class="md">And once again, passing even more gun laws when the ones on the books already are not even enforced is pointless.

How about mandatory prison sentences of a minimum of 10 years for some of the crimes already on the books?  Like a felon with a gun, making a straw purchase, or using a gun in any sort of crime?

That is the real problem, not that there are not enough laws.  It is that the laws we already have are almost never enforced.  I am sick of hearing about some felon doing a robbery with a pistol, then only getting 2 or 3 years.  TO me, crimes like that should be 10 years minimum.  With each following offence doubled.

Criminals know they will only get a slap on the wrist, so have no fear of the law.  Start putting teeth back into them, and I bet the crimes like that drop quickly.  Otherwise, you can pass 100 laws and prohibit all weapons and they will still get them.

Mexico has the exact same problem.  Outright prohibition, yet their criminal justice system is corrupt and a joke so none of the criminals care.  That is why they have sent some of their worst cartel leaders to the US.  As bad as our system is, it's better than theirs.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok but their system isn't bad because of their gun laws, furthermore, our shitty drug policies with their mandatory minimums do nothing, and your solution is the fundamental problem, you and the justice system in America I. General sees it as punishment and not a correctional facility, you fix the problem that motivates the crime, you fix problems that cause addiction not jail addicts, you dont out a ten year sentence on gun charges, you take away the guns from people who shouldn't have them, which means tighter regulations, not outright bans.</div>

That is nonsensical in the extreme.  What about the problems that cause theft, muggings, sexual assault, rape, murder, car theft, and all of the other problems?

I have no freaking interest in trying to "solve the problems", I care about removing those from the general public and being punished so they do not do it again.

If your dog craps on the carpet, do you try and find out what it needs to stop doing that, or do you whack it across the nose and scold it?  Because I can promise you, doing one will do absolutely nothing to stop the problem, and the other one will.</div>

The simple fact is, even when caught those that violate most of the gun laws are never prosecuted.

Case in point, a "Straw Purchase" or falsely filling out an ATF 4473 is a felony, but guess how many people are ever convicted for that?  Or all the cases of felons with a firearm that are essentially tossed out of court.

It does not matter if you add a million laws, if they are not enforced, they are all worthless and will do nothing.

Want to see things change?  Mandatory enforcement and minimum sentencing for things like "armed robbery" and "felon with a firearm" violations.  Actually lock them up for a minimum of 10 years, and you might start to see things change.

But I am sick and tired of reading about some gangbanger with several felonies getting caught after doing a drive-by, and then after their trial only being sentenced to 2 years.  Where that is how long they were in jail awaiting trial and are released.

I am highly 2nd Amendment, but am even more pro-enforcement of the laws.  And if there is no enforcement, there is essentially no law.  They just need to get serious about enforcing the laws they already have.</div>

    <div class="md">Please tell me, what school shootings has Britain had since it banned guns? If gun control doesn't work why not? You have an explanation for everything. Also having a firearm makes you more likely to die of violent crime because you are more likely to try and play the hero. Rather than letting professionals deal with it or minding your own damn business and not costing people their lives.</div>

    <div class="md">Filling my "bullshit gun lobby talking points" bingo card right up

"More guns than people" nobody said shit about the number of guns sitting around unused. Every aspect of the statistic I quotes reflects an actual use of a firearm, with a 22:1 ratio of bad uses for every good use

"If firearms were the problem, everyone would be dead" Everybody isn't dead, hence guns don't present a problem for the 117K people shot in the US every year (35% of which die), got it

"Now one third of kids are medicated and have ADHD and depression." Number one cause of death for kids 5-14 in the US is a firearm (third year in a row), but TIL kids on medication for their ADHD are the real problem and the reason adults are shooting themselves and each other. Ok.</div>

    <div class="md">I love the argument I hear from all these fucking new age gun nuts. "Well gun laws don't prevent bad people from having guns!" And in the same conversation will defend "Well no I haven't registered all my firearms, I don't want the government to know how many I have!" Like my brother in Christ you are literally part of the problem. Do I agree with all gun laws? No, but do I understand there should be more strict licensing for owning and possession of firearms? Yes, because any idiot can see that just passing a preliminary background check can get a gun. Hell my dad is 70, he was talking about wanting a 10mm handgun, we went to one of our LGS and I wanted a 9mm for myself (got a Beretta 92f 💪). We live in a fairly relaxed gun law state but he was shocked he was able to walk in and buy his gun and leave with it the same day, because you COULD NOT do that back when he was originally still buying guns.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah we have gun laws so there’s totally no way anyone can get guns illegally. We also have drug laws so there’s no way people can do drugs. Oh and laws against murder and theft so that can’t happen either. Oh wait… 

We do not have a gun problem, we have a culture problem.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s a common misconception. white men are commonly the active shooters. An active shooter is someone in a public place trying to rack up a high body count. Mass shooters are mostly black, because most mass shootings are just shootings with multiple victims. The KC shooting probably looked something like [this](https://youtu.be/zKZbyC1ccMY?si=S_nm1UwH9NkjEyx6)</div>

It's pretty hyperbolic to argue that people want zero restrictions on firearms. Like of course you can find one person in the world who says that but we're not in high school and we don't make arguments like that. Right?</div>

    <div class="md">>It's pretty hyperbolic to argue that people want zero restrictions on firearms

This is not hyperbolic at all, it's a mainstream Republican position. Multiple people are arguing this in this very thread.

Much like with abortion, I think right wingers confuse their imaginary common sense regulations with what is actually being implemented and legislated. We have elected officials saying guns should be allowed in bars. There is no reasonable universe where that makes sense, and yet it is on the docket and being voted that way, time and again.

Right wing America are "catching the car" on totally unrestricted guns, and they'll eventually start regretting it just like they do with abortion. Things just have to get worse first.</div>

    <div class="md">Safe storage laws. Guns cannot be owned unless you have a locking container to put them in, where they must always be stored if they aren't on your person.

This would cut down on legal sales to irresponsible morons as well as gangsters who cannot provide proof, and would improve the standards inside the responsible gun owning community, making thefts less common.</div>

The Gun Control Act, National Firearms Act, and a plethora of others are in effect all the time. You need to do RESEARCH.

    <div class="md">You are uninformed. But don't worry, a not so friendly Libertarian is here to smack the dumbass out of you, though I doubt it will work. 

First, driver's licensing and safety testing came AFTER the requirement for licensing. In some states, it was several decades between the requirement for a license and the requirement to test. If you were a thinking person, which we've already established that you aren't, but if you were, you might ask why is that? Because the original purpose of the license was to generate "tax" revenue without actually having to pass a tax law. Brilliant isn't it. As with all government policies, the stated purpose and the actual purpose often are very different. And they will gladly backfill the stated purpose with public safety concerns. "Licensing saves lives!" they will cry. But make no mistake, they don't give a fuck about safety. They want control. And money. But mostly control. 

Second, there is no right to a car in the Bill of Rights, so the rest of the analogy can fuck off.</div>

    <div class="md">Please continue down this train of thought and see where it leads you.  You don't have to have a license to buy a car.  You can buy whatever car you want.  A license is only required for driving on public streets.  You dont need a "background check" to get a license.   A license does not prevent people from choosing to break the law.  People drive without licenses all the time. 

A license only proves that you know the laws of driving in public.  Licenses are designed to prevent accidents, not malicious intent.  Do you think that people who commit murder are just unaware that murder is illegal?

I'm absolutely on board with "licenses" for guns the same way we do them for cars.  The question is why you think that would do anything about violence.</div>

    <div class="md">You guys keep referencing cars...so stupid. The most heavily regulated product you can buy, requires a license in every state. Safety features, traffic laws, too many laws to mention. You can absolutely not do whatever the hell you want with a car, so keep pretending that's a good point. But, that being said, the entire second amendment should be scrapped. Have a nice day.</div>

    <div class="md">A license isn't required to own or operate a car. Neither is registration or insurance. A blind person can purchase a car and drive it on their property if they wanted to. Nothing prevents a person from buying and owning a vehicle. Nothing should prevent a person from buying or owning a weapon either. You're missing the entire point.

To your point even in constitutional carry states you cannot do anything you want with a gun. Murder and assault are already crimes. Threatening someone's life is already a crime.

Guns themselves are also heavily "regulated" with safety features and other specifications.

What's an even crazier point is that many areas with constitutional carry also have significantly less gun violence than other areas with a high amount of gun regulations. Almost as if it's not the guns.

Wanting to scrap the 2A... You need to seriously reevaluate your position on this. Many instances throughout history the government have taken away its people's guns only to commit mass amounts of violence against them afterwards. Then not to mention the times our own government has used weapons against us and sometimes if it weren't for the 2A those people would've been helpless. Like the Battle of Athens. If it weren't for the 2A those people would've been screwed by the government. Then you have the Indians... They were forced to give up their weapons and put them in camps where they attempted to reeducate them. Or how about the Kent State Massacre. The list goes on.</div>

That's also true for firearms. Misuse of guns can come with heavy punishments. Let's not pretend that guns are unregulated and you "can do whatever the hell you want" with them. That's simply not true and tells me you aren't actually aware of the rules and regulations surrounding lawful use and responsible ownership.</div>

    <div class="md">That’s my point they’re so heavily regulated yet car accidents happen all the time because either irresponsible people get behind the wheel or criminals get behind the wheel- regardless of who it is everyone agrees it’s not fault of the car it’s fault of the person.

    <div class="md">I second this. 

It's becoming clear that the 2A needs to be amended to reflect the modern era and allows us to regulate guns as heavily as needed to end gun violence.

Including banning them completely if need be. Which is what I believe.</div>

    <div class="md">Yep. You could go on and on too. What about all the hamburgers that contributed to obesity and heart disease? Cigerettes, lung disease. Legal drug OD's, opiods?

    <div class="md">The overwhelming majority of what they consider to be a mass shooting are examples of inner city gang violence committed with handguns by illegally obtained weapons that won't be affected at all by the legislation they propose. Make no mistake, it's not about stopping shootings. It's about disarming the population to make it easier assert their authoritarian policies.</div>

    <div class="md">>Time to move beyond daily mass shootings and ~~gun~~ **ghetto** culture.

Fixed that for ya, since, you know, most of these "mass shootings" are the result of gang and other criminal activity.

Are you gonna address *that* problem, or continue attacking the normal innocent people?</div>

    <div class="md">So I live in Canada where there’s pretty strict gun laws and still I turn on the news and just about everyday there’s a shooting or stabbing or a car plowing through a group of people just in the Toronto area. 

Guns have been around for hundreds of years, knives have been around for many thousands of years and it seems like these are relatively new issues (past 60 years or so). It’s obviously a mental health problem. The solution is not just getting rid of guns trust me Canada is trying that and if the US would try that you’d have a civil war which would easily end up deadlier than most wars in history.</div>

    <div class="md">Nice link, would be better if they weren't constantly linking to themselves or other articles which themselves were linking to other news publications that then linked to other articles with no ends to the sources. They also seem to have a couple sources which didn't even link to anything other than a "trust me bro, I heard it from these guys somewhere". They also pointed to a couple databases that when gone through shows the opposite of their claims, and also cherry picked data from other articles that didn't support their narrative. If I wrote that little piece there and handed it in as a school paper I would of probably failed.

Also the NRA isn't the big boogyman the "gun control advocates" thinks they are in that article. There were an absolute ton of accusations against them with no good evidence, and that's disregarding that the NRA is doing next to nothing to support gun rights as a whole.</div>

    <div class="md">And despite the fact that it happens everyday the stats for 2023 were: 43,071 deaths *(24,090 of that were suicides which could be considered victimless but we'll leave them in the numbers)* and 36,391 injured.  

source: [https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls)

That means a total of 79,462 people in US were affected by gun violence.  

There were 336 million people in the US in 2023.  

If we do the math: 79,462 / 336,000,000 = 0.0002364   

So 0.02% of the population experienced a gun related injury or death.   Meaning 99.98% of the population won't ever be impacted by gun violence in a given year.  

When most people see the actual stats and are presented with how unlikely they are to be impacted by guns, they tend to stop worrying about it and ask their lawmakers to instead focus on things more likely to impact their lives like taxes and jobs and healthcare and pretty much everything else.</div>

And in reality, that likelihood isn't spread evenly - its very much affected by your neighborhood and lifestyle.

For most people its actually .0002%, and then there are criminals in certain parts of the US who probably have a 2% chance each year.</div>

    <div class="md">Exactly!  Not only only is it very rare but it is also something a person has some aspect of control over to further reduce the risks.  For example leaving high crime areas and making personal choices to be aware of ones surroundings and not making themselves appear as an easy target for crime.  Also choosing to be a nice, polite, respectful person who avoids, and doesn't instigate, confrontations also helps to further reduce the chances of being in a violent encounter where a gun could get used.</div>

    <div class="md">Might be a stronger argument if not for the way many people drive.  All the time, money, and effort spent to learn how to drive properly, and we still end up with apparent chaos on the roads.

    <div class="md">>what about all the billions of people who are not murders? if murders are a problem why didn't they kill anyone?

Because they're not murderers and *only the murderers* are the problem. What kind of argument is this supposed to be?  


>thats why you argue isnt sound, you guys dont need to have such easy access to handguns. handguns are literally banned in my country because of how easily you can conceal it. guess how much gun crime my country has.

So either your country has no murders at all, or - wait for it - people who can't get handguns use something else. Are you happier because people in your country get murdered with fire, knives, clubs, cars, and people's bare hands?</div>

    <div class="md">my argument was mocking your original comment, thats basically what your saying.

yes every country has crime but knife crime is more difficult because you cant easily conceal a machete, you can hide a little knife but you need to do some serious stabbing to actually kill someone with it. but with guns its very easy to claim a life, and a handgun us very concealable. 

besides, my country doesn't hang knives on the wall and made it a part of our culture essentially.</div>

    <div class="md">thats just a lie, i live in the uk and thats not the case. its blades, we have banned blades outside the house and a full ban on concealed blades like balisongs and flip knives.

while we can be extreme with the blades thing sometimes, you dont really need to carry a blade outside so it barely affects anyone and is a minor problem. 

so to answer your question when asked properly: i dont mind living in a world where you are not allowed to carry blades in public.</div>

So the one big blue area has an African American gun violence problem and the whole country has to just act like that's totally not a thing. Then reclassify everything else to make it a mass shooting when it's gang related, until it makes it look bad and you have to drop other stats to form a narrative.</div>

    <div class="md">This isn't a gang related shooting.

This type of shooting has been escalating all over the country, big cities and small cities. In ABQ, it's a new wave of epidemic.

It involves just regular daily disagreements between people - disrespect - getting escalated to shooting.

It is a cultural phenomenon escalated and made so much worse because of our gun problem. 

Trying to call this organized gang violence or "gang banging" isn't even close to accurate and it's essentially racist.  The genesis of most of these shootings is a tiny slight between two people being escalated into a shooting match. In a shooting in KC last month, one person shot another person because he scuffed his sneakers.

Even taking KC out of it, MO has tons of crime, way above the national average, and it's like this all over the rust belt, sun belt, and all through the secondary and third-tier cities.

Awful culture glorifying violence and stoking fear at every turn, corrupt and inefficient local governments, state government who actively make things worse, and a toxic mix of guns.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s actually a fair and cohesive argument to say that the issue is societal but the abundance of firearms exacerbates the problem and creates opportunities for events like this.  The problems are:
1.  Too few people on the side of gun control articulate it this way, and instead fuel political tensions by only focusing on the call to strip guns away from people.
2.  There are way too many firearms in circulation for the idea of a mass confiscation to be anything but laughable. 
3.  The invention of 3D printing would make such a confiscation effort a total waste of time and money, on top of likely triggering a large scale violent conflict.
4.  And this is the most important one; we have a right, guaranteed by the Constitution, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self defense and as a bulwark against government tyranny.  You are welcome to move to somewhere that doesn’t guarantee that right.</div>

    <div class="md">I generally agree with your points.

1. It shouldn't be only on one group of people to propose solutions. The main problem that gun control advocates is that they do not hold gun rights activists accountable to propose solutions. The general blanket statement "we have a mental health problem in this country" is accurate but unrelated to the gun problem.  Generally speaking, in most civilized countries, a person who is wildly anti-government and hoarding guns and ammo would be deemed mentally unfit, and his weapons would be taken. In the US, this can't be considered mentally unfit, because it would sweep up hundreds or thousands of people. Likewise, people saying "this is a gang problem", are also just abdicating solutions. The simple fact is that every city in the country has an anti-gang unit, and despite massive investent, the police haven't stopped (only shrunk) gangs. Ultimately, there is a 1st amendment right to be in a gang, just like there is a 2nd amendment right to own a gun.  I am open to any solution that isn't systematically racist, and is legally enforceable, to curb gun violence. Nothing - no one thing - that any gun rights activist has proposed from "allowing God in schools" to "thoughts and prayers" has had any effect on gun violence rates. As long as the proposal is effective, legal, and not racist, let's hear those proposals. Of course, the guns right activists will never make those proposals, because they don't exist. 
2. No one is proposing mass confiscation.
3. See #2.
4. Agreed.

The solution that most people want, and most civilized countries have, isn't mass confiscation, it's just simply registration.

It's already illegal to transfer guns to ineligible people (minors, criminals, drug addicts, etc). This rule is unenforceable.

The answer is gun violence is simply to register guns, to a natural owner, from time of manufacture to the time of destruction. Once a year, the police come to inspect your gun collection, ensure you have them, that they are properly secured, and that's that. Gun sales or transfers are done by a FFL or at a police station, and that's that. If you are in possession of an unregistered gun, the gun is destroyed and you go to jail, lose your right to own guns when you get out.

That's it. Super simple. Everyone can still own hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo, as many guns as you want, all the types, etc.

And we can start going to parades again without worrying about getting shot in the fucking face for no good reason.

Gangs would be deeply impacted (but not eliminated) - the primary source of gang weapons (i.e. straw purchases) would dry up over night. We'd have as many or more guns owned than now, etc.

Before you complain about how easy would be for the government to do a mass confiscation if in the event of a tyrannical takeover, just remember: you yourself said there are just too many to do mass gun confiscation. 

Finally, regarding a "bulwark against tyranny". I think we can pretty much retire this concept as a useful argument. The government was about 90 minutes from being overthrown on January 6th. It wasn't citizens with guns that stopped the overthrow, it was 800 cops with guns and nightsticks and tazers and tear gas. When the moment of truth came, guns in the hands of citizens.. did nothing. Luckily, the police were just able to put down the rebellion before Congress was overthrown. It was pretty close. A few cops did heros work and protected Congress and the constitutional order from being destroyed. Pretty lucky. But in general it validates the idea that really the purpose of guns isn't to preserve the right of the people to reject a tyrannical government, but rather, to protect themselves from other citizens when the government fails to protect them. That is a much more real, present, and realistic threat, and one which guns are proven to be very useful: when the police are too busy or on soft-strike, your own firearm might be the only thing left for you to rely on. That is the right we should be laser focused on, not the unproven claim that personal firearms are a solution to government tyranny.

    <div class="md">I don't want the police in my house ever, much less once a year. I shouldn't have to choose between the 2nd amendment and 4th amendment. 

Also the government wasn't "90 minutes from being overthrown", do you really think that anything that could have been done at the capital on J6 would result in an overthrow of the government? 

The gun control movement wants to ban all guns ultimately, right now they might say they just want this or just want that, but once they get their current agenda passed they aren't going to stop. Do you think that if the next piece of gun control gets passed that Brady, Every Town, MDA, etc are going to dissolve? No, they'll move on to the next thing, whatever you give them is never enough. The NFA wasn't enough, the GCA wasn't enough, the Hughes amendment wasn't enough, nothing short of banning all guns will be enough in the long term for these people.</div>

    <div class="md">> instead fuel political tensions by only focusing on the call to strip guns away from people.

See, the problem is, literally any effective form of gun control involves separating the offender from the gun BEFORE they've shot someone. Which inherently means they still fall under the "responsible gun owner" label that gun fans viciously defend.

I genuinely don't know how to advocate for gun control without falling into this trap. Nearly every offer is a "law abiding citizen" until they suddenly aren't, or they acquire their gun from a "responsible gun owner" who wasn't responsible enough to secure their firearm.

It's an impossible situation. We can't move forward with proactive gun control because any control, no matter how reasonable, is framed as "punishing law abiding citizens".

Especially the ones who are about to snap.</div>

    <div class="md">We should legalize duels.

I mean, yes, the idea is crazy. But hear me out:

All duels have to be agreed upon by a local official, to ensure both parties are in good mental health and has a will. Both duelists waive their rights to life or lawsuit if killed/injured. A time and location is set, weapons vary but must be agreed upon by both parties. Duels can be live-streamed on an official government website. Loser is either publicly shamed or killed. 

No more spinning the block on the ops. No more shooting up a parade because someone stepped on your J’s. Crips and Bloods train their best duelists to champion battles for them. No collateral damage. 

If the cia can get impoverished black communities addicted to crack, they can get them addicted to legalized dueling.</div>

    <div class="md">Well full gang style violence is higher than ever without the proliferation of said gangs. I'm from Chicago, cousin was a disciple. Murdered in 06. Even back then people were getting out of the hard-core initiations and were dealing across lines to make more $. They also tended to get killed off way more. Nowadays you can have the same "gang" getting represented but 3 streets over is the same gang, and they're all still killing each other. 

What you describe is road rage without the road. And the simple fact that will always be true, the only sure fire way, is to have good guys with guns massively outnumber the bad guys. Don't give them a chance to let politicized judges let them out with a promise to reappear, which almost every time will result with a fugitive. One that's left to terrorize the public even more. 

And going back to outlaw days. We named certain people outlaws because they existed outside the law. If you went up to one and shot them in the back, you were called a hero. Handicapping the good guys with guns as we see happening, while ignoring the bad guys with guns is why we are where we are. And no where in the media is this allowed because it's counter to the narrative. It's all ever about gun grabbing. And I'm glad that I live in a state that won't stand for it. To make an ammendment reversing the 2nd, we need a 2/3rds vote in the house and congress and that aint ever gonna happen. So civil war is threatened by politicians that want to act in a treasonous way. A civil war that the military won't fight and the side that won't just leave the good guys with guns alone, can't win. Which is why we have more illegals mostly fighting age males coming up from the border, who now outnumber the amount of population in the least 5 populated states, and out pacing our entire countries birth rate. Force them into the military and they won't see a problem killing Americans. 

Yapping on about gun crime and statistics and political slants is accomplishing nothing. The law is on our side. Wanna fix it, create an industry of armed security everywhere, separate of the cops. Like... a militia. Armed teachers in every single classroom. Amnesty for anyone that puts down criminals with firearms. That would change the culture. That would improve every measurable crime statistic.</div>

There were over 800 cops in downtown KC that day. Over 800 armed officers. You guys consider them "good guys with guns", right? What exactly did they do to stop them? If I recall it was unarmed civilians who tackled the guy after he started running away. 

What about Uvalde? Cops had the school surrounded, they didn't do jack shit. Good guys with guns my ass. A mother had to run in to ensure the safety of her child in the middle of an active shooting. 

So get the fuck out of here with that "good guy with a gun" bullshit because it's been proven that they don't do jack shit.</div>

    <div class="md">Their fuck up was being next to gang bangers because gang bangers gonna do gang banging shit. Now in the news, we get to hear all day every day about a dead woman and 9 hurt kids, but not the gang bangers. 

Last year there was a mass shooting in Miami. No one saw anything, but thats because it was gang bangers ambushing other gang bangers. Called a mass shooting, when it was not. And the community helped the gang bangers by not being snitches. 

Fix that. Collateral damage stops happening as much. You're furthering the narrative and making innocent law abiding citizens less safe. You're standing on the corpses of children not wanting to solve the problem and want more piles of dead children to further your agenda. You're deplorable.</div>

    <div class="md">Or howabout 5 min on [youtube?](https://youtu.be/vHdDtqwdImE?feature=shared)

3 involved. One reported shot in the face. A bunch of hoodlums but only 2 reported. 3 detained, 2 arrested, 1 let go. A perp treated as a vic maybe? Wouldn't be the 1st time that's happened. People talking plenty but you're just gonna go on and on about "muh narrative".</div>

    <div class="md">Gang banger has evolved to not mean actual gang. They're mostly all posers. Wannabe gang bangers. No militarized chain of command exists anymore. The actual gangs that care about what gang they're in and opponents are, are all in prisons. On the outside they all get along if there's a profit to be made. There's a ton of infighting and that's why you don't see actual gang warfare anymore.  
Thanks for proving you are incapable of very basic modern general truths known to basically everyone.</div>

    <div class="md">There's plenty of sensible gun policy.  
  
- Don't point a gun at someone if not necessary (eg: brandishing).  
  
- Don't shoot (for fun) in areas where it's dangerous & not necessary (eg: in city limits, backyard, etc.).  
  
- You are responsible for every shot you make (unless you're a cop, this part is not sensible tbf).  
  
- Don't shoot someone outside of life/death or grave bodily harm situations (unless you're a cop, that's not sensible).

    <div class="md">These "sensible" policies you speak of are VERY broad to the degree of not being sensible in some cases.

Yes, don't needlessly brandish a firearm.

I would agree with urban areas as the population density and property damages makes recreational shooting problematic, but rural areas should have no need to restrict backyard recreational shooting as long as the bullets stay in your property and close neighbors don't mind the noise.

Yes, everyone is responsible for every bullet they fire, I don't understand about the "unless your a cop" part as they too need to be responsible for every bullet they fire so they don't strike a innocent person or their fellow officers.

Yes, don't shoot someone unless you believe your life or way or living is threatened. I still don't understand about the "unless your a cop" as there doesn't seem to be much of a change for that except for adding innocent life to it to be something like "...unless your life or way of life, or an innocents life or way of life..."</div>

    <div class="md">Gun control has been increasing since the 1960s yet crime as well as gun crime has been skyrocketing. Most modern gun control measures focus on things outside what would of stopped the crimes.

I have said it before that politicians are using gun control as a bandaid that is going on a layer of bandaids that are covering a festering wound. Putting the gun control bandaid isn't going to fix the root problem and we as communities need to find and stitch close the wound so we can solve the problem.</div>

False. There are also literally hundreds of millions more guns in circulation since the 1960s.

The root problem is the guns.</div>

    <div class="md">The vast majority of mass shootings (almost all firearm related crime as well) are gang related. In areas that have never been helped, and never will be helped so long as they can ignore it. There are other avenues we could take to reduce or eliminate ‘mass shootings’. Giving up our guns to give the government more power over us seems far more dangerous. Over 250 million people have been killed by their leaders in power over the past 100 years, and that is a very conservative estimate.</div>

    <div class="md">As someone who has had to rent out a U-Haul a couple times, yes you need a license to rent one out.
However the U-Haul do not have a good level of anti theft features a normal car would have and are easy to steal.

Last I checked you don't need to show a license to steal something though.</div>

    <div class="md">Depends on which state, in some they don't even bother to pull people over.

Also, driving = privilege, gun = right

I would like to point out btw, that words are far more dangerous then guns. Words can cause people to be violent, to inspire people, or to divide people, yet despite the danger words present, each person is given the right to speak to the masses, with no permit needed.</div>

    <div class="md">I find it funny that we often act like driving is a privilege that can be revoked.  When realistically there's not enough actual enforcement of the law to make that reality (people drive without licenses and insurance all the time).  While that's imo a good thing because less enforcement of laws means more freedom, it also makes the conversations on rights pretty moot.  Many of your "rights" are without a doubt infringed upon in the letter of the law, but in practice, you likely only suffer for violating the law if suffering is what you deserve (you screwed up bad enough to get the attention of the law, perhaps many times).</div>

    <div class="md">If there's a standard license scheme that all guns are first sold through, and that lindens can be taken away for careless storage or use of a firearm, I most certainly think theft of guns and illegal guns would go down. 

Where exactly did they get the guns? What barriers were there? Perhaps it wouldn't stop every instance but it would stop most.</div>

    <div class="md">You don’t think these people that committed heinous crimes are beyond fucked up mentally? Like that isn’t within the realm of possibility? People aren’t born bad. It’s an amalgamation of their environment and childhood experiences that build them into the adult they are. If they’re so stunted that shooting people is what they think they need to do, like yeah most normal well-adjusted people don’t do that. 

Does that excuse it? Fuck no. Throw the book at them. Let them learn to be better while incarcerated.</div>

Inner city it's likely a street gun that's been passed around it ain't exactly uncommon for middle schoolers to be walking around with guns in certain areas.

    <div class="md">We all know what the real problem is. It’s not guns. Come on people. Stop being a pussy and let’s actually admit what kind of problem this is. 
Look I know I’m a pussy too. But we all know it’s the damned white people in this country toting guns and their gang violence. 99.99  percent of all mass shootings are committed by white gang members in the inner city. This is just pure undeniable fact. Sorry but it is.</div>

    <div class="md">There is an irrefutable correlation between the spike of SSRIs since the mid 90s to the phenomenon of School Shootings occurring. Correlation isn’t causation but it’s pretty fucking weird thats 100% of school shooters were on SSRIs.</div>

    <div class="md">Completely agree, but the argument I’ve heard that does seem to carry water is: “Mentally healthy people don’t commit mass violence, and since the invention of SSRIs and MAOIs, mentally unhealthy people are on them. 
But, that doesn’t change the fact that there were mentally unhealthy people before the arrival of those drugs and there were NOT mass shootings, at least to the degree that there are now.  
Not disagreeing with you, just presenting what I’ve found to be a fair argument.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah. Its just too obvious to be ignored that they start prescribing children SSRI in the mid 90s, and then Columbine and onward mass shooting become a thing. And its hard to ignore that everyone still had guns in the 80s and prior, so what changed? The only other answers are the culture of america changed. So what, they blame video games? Movies? What drastic change occurred in the culture of America from 1989 to 1999(Columbine). We could say the maybe the internet, hyper sensitivity to a new mode of media and fps shooter games. We could say Nu Metal and Gangster rap. But that all seems like a psy op conspiracy theory straight out of alex jones. The obvious truth(to me) is the spike of prescriptions of SSRIs for children.</div>

    <div class="md">I tend to agree.  It is for sure a Hell of a coincidence…  The MSEs before the 80s tended to involve people with significant mental health issues as well; especially schizophrenia, which to this day we don’t know the cause of but we know there seems to be a genetic factor and a link between psychotropic/psychoactive drug use in adolescence.</div>

    <div class="md">I’ll never understand the people who want to outright ban guns, the people who are fucking idiotic enough to harm others won’t be stopped by a ban.

Someones psychopathy isn’t fucking changed by a goddam legal barrier, if a mentally ill motherfucker wants to hurt someone, he will find a way to. 

Look at the EU’s non-gun violence, their massive amounts of terrorist attacks compared to the U.S., honestly it seems like the lack of guns over there is actively harming them</div>

    <div class="md">UK has been doing great with their acid/knife attacks.

Wonder what their problem is, if it's not gun ownership?


Oh yeah, we let people who've lost their damn minds walk amongst us.


Lock up the crazies again. People might not cling to their defensive weapons so tightly after we've re-institutionalized the schizos and maniacs.

Clearly the issue is so many people in today's society feel an urge to kill their neighbors, coworkers, or classmates.

This is so clearly a mental health problem on such a big scale that it surprises me there's still people who think guns are the problem.


I's the intent we should be focusing on, not the implement.</div>

Anyone with anything other than an affirmative response to the fact that we NEED to do something about this glaringly obvious and tragic issue is part of the problem. You can be pro gun AND pro common sense gun regulations and actual enforcement of gun laws that are on the books. What we have now is a disaster.</div>

    <div class="md">So you are either too ideologically possessed to recognize an argument that differs from your own, or you are being intellectually dishonest.  No one is saying “Do nothing. It’s the price for freedom.”  People who don’t agree with idea of forfeiting their right to self defense because of the actions of others are presenting the argument that there is a mental health issue in this country that is creating a dangerous environment due to the fact that we are a nation that guarantees the right of its citizens to have access to firearms.</div>

    <div class="md">Ideologically possessed, that’s cute. When it comes to tightening up regulations around firearms and enforcing laws that are already on the books, the 2A crowd is absolutely saying “do nothing.” It’s not just one way or the other. There are many factors and those factors include ease of access to deadly weapons, poor/no systems in place to dispossess known unstable/dangerous individuals of their guns, and addressing mental health on a mass scale. It’s not either/or. It’s all of it.</div>

    <div class="md">Well that’s an active investigation which means that, conveniently, we won’t know the accuracy of that claim until it’s over.  Provided that the serial numbers on the weapons weren’t scratched off, and that the guns weren’t stolen but were illegally sold or gifted to the shooters, I’d say they will very likely bring charges against the person who supplied them.</div>

    <div class="md">The NRA, the largest “gun lobbyist” has donated a little over $40,000,000 since 1998.  I agree. Let’s get rid of the milk-toast, ineffectual racket that is the NRA and get an organization that actually works to protect the 2nd Amendment. 

That being said, I’d like to see how you get from blocking gun lobbyists from D.C., to stopping mass shootings.</div>

    <div class="md">Also, if you really read it, the 2nd allows for a well-regulated militia to keep and bear arms. Says nothing about your every day dipshit being able to walk around with an AR strapped to his back.

    <div class="md">This is an example of redefining terms to back up your arguments.  The “militia” during the time the Constitution was written referred to all able bodied men.  “Regulated” during that period meant “trained”.  There was no standing army at the time, only a small navy.  The people were expected to be the defense of the nation.  To be that defense, they had to be armed and trained.  But not trained by a government entity, because that would have just been an army.  Trained as in educated. As in by their elders. Parents, teachers, older sibling, etc.</div>

Anyway, here I am in a bad faith goose chase like I said I wouldn’t do. Disengaging. If you think the 2nd was written so any old fuckhead on the street should have the inalienable right to be strapped with a high powered rifle, you can go fuck a gun. That’s as disingenuous as it gets. The bar needs to be higher. It could start by existing. Until then I’ll just hope my kids don’t get gunned down by one of your fellow enthusiasts.

    <div class="md">Quit spouting misinformation about the militia wording. 

"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." 

It states both of these shall not be infringed. Nowhere does it say one is required for the other. Do some research before you regurgitate same falsities designed to change our constitution.</div>

    <div class="md">Do you think I have the power to change the constitution? I’m flattered.

The intent, and what stood since its inception to 2008 is that the 2nd was written to ensure the federal gov could not infringe on States’ individual rights to defend themselves. They didn’t just write the whole first half of the amendment for no reason. The wording is specific and concise. The words “well-regulated militia” aren’t in there by mistake. In 2008 a conservative Supreme Court overturned the long standing precedent that did not view 2A as a mechanism to give every individual a right to keep and bear arms.  By a margin of 5-4, hardly a landslide and, with more recent info coming out about Clarence Thomas’ sketchy dealings with corporate lobbyists, was undoubtedly influenced by the gun lobby.  

The framers had it right in the first place. They didn’t mean that every single person should be able to go down to Walmart and pick up an AR-15 just for fun. Any reasonable person would come to that conclusion because it’s so fucking obvious. And it’s so obvious because not a day goes by that we’re not overwhelmed with stories of gun violence and innocent bloodshed. But, hey, at least you get to feel cool at the range with your buddies.  Totally worth it.</div>

    <div class="md">You need to brush up on reading comprehension of the English language. Tell me how you could possibly gain from that sentence in the constitution that to bear arms, it is required to have a well regulated militia. The amendment guarantees both without infringement. You're right the founders got it right the first time, because they added "shall not be infringed".</div>

    <div class="md">That’s not what I said. Maybe you should reexamine your reading comp skills. I said it’s about context. And the context does not reasonably conclude that it means a fucking free for all. In fact, we probably would be having this conversation if not for the efforts of private interests in 2008.</div>

    <div class="md">>Also, if you really read it, the 2nd allows for a well-regulated militia to keep and bear arms. Says nothing about your every day dipshit being able to walk around with an AR strapped to his back.

You did say that.

They wrote their intent explicitly and in plain English. What context are you going on about after reading what I quoted from the amendment?</div>

    <div class="md">My main point is that the Supreme Court visited this issue in like 1940 and the ruling agreed with the interpretation that I agree with today. It stood for 70 years until gun lobby had an opening to sway the court in 2008. Look what happens to gun deaths after 2008, particularly suicide. I know correlation doesn’t necessarily mean causation, but there is a clear correlation. 

I just want to be clear in your argument. You really the framers really meant for guns to be as ubiquitous a part of our society as they are today? You really believe *this* was the vision of the founders? That’s fucking depressing.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes. That's why they wrote it plainly to not be misconstrued.... Which both yourself and courts try to do.  When the courts ruled in your favor (unconstitutional gun regulation) you say it was a sound choice of the court, but when you disagree with the court's ultimate decision you blame "gun lobbyists". Bad argument, bad take, can't take you seriously at all.</div>

    <div class="md">Given that an estimated 44% of Americans say they live in a household with a gun, and given that estimate is probably low, we can assume that at least half of all people in America have some level of access to at least one firearm. 

If guns caused the problem, we'd all be dead already. Collective punishment is not only wrong but impossible to carry out and a waste of time, energy, and resources, and would absolutely make things worse.</div>

    <div class="md">Sounds good!

No guns for everyone, INCLUDING the rich and famous! (Politicians as well)

That means no armed security guards.

No guns for police other since acorns be out hunting!</div>

    <div class="md">Hahaha. The fucking acorn story is straight out of Reno 911.  It’s amazing.  I was reading it and just imagined like Donald Glover handcuffed in the back seat as two officers opened fire and he just lays down screaming as the glass explodes all around him.  Someone needs to use SORA to create this scene. Lol</div>

    <div class="md">Of course the guns are the problem. We can't mention that 13% of the population commits 90% of the violent crime. Or that the guns used were not legally obtained or registered. But yeah, it's the guns. So let's make laws that make it harder to legally own one 🤦‍♂️</div>

    <div class="md">Part of why we have never been invaded is due to the fact that a large majority of Americans have their own firearms to defend their land. Guns are capable of a lot of damage no matter which model, but we must remember that they are tools. In the hands of a responsible gun owner, most won’t use their firearm unless they ultimately have to. But allowing Psychopaths to purchase any kind of firearm is just asinine. A good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun, sure. But 9/10 times that bad guy was able to gun down someone before our “good guy” could do anything. Our good guy may be a hero and our bad guy dead or in jail, but the innocent bystander didn’t have to die or get shot. Keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people.</div>

    <div class="md">Disagree.  It is correct to say that minorities commit a disproportionate amount of violent crime.  But it is a mistake to say it’s due to their race.  You could make a case that it is due to economic factors in minority communities.  You could make a better case that it is due to cultural factors in those communities.  People are created equal; cultures are not.
Also white people are more likely to be “mass shooters”, probably because they are more likely to suffer from mental illness and be prescribed psychotropic medications which have side effects like violent impulses and psychosis.</div>

Get out of your Mommy's basement, take a shower, and get a life.

Or are you only capable of insulting strangers on the internet?

And, BTW, your insults are lame and childish, which is why it's so easy to peg you as an Incel.

    <div class="md">Gun control is an ineffectual farce pushed forward by an increasingly authoritarian government who uses tragedies to promote the idea that people should surrender their responsibility to protect themselves and their families to the State. 

The gun control advocates completely ignore the mental health crisis in the country.  They cry about gun lobby’s who are outspent 100 fold by the pharmaceutical companies who push psychotropic medications onto prepubescent boys because they can’t pay attention in the schools that are geared towards female students and where healthy male activities (ie rough and tumble play) are suppressed. 

The gun control advocates can never seem to propose a single idea that would actually prevent mass shooting events, and instead propose blanket legislation that would only make it more difficult for law abiding citizens to exercise their right to defense.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh! The little Incel is getting upset.

Mental health is not the reason the USA has so many gun deaths, guns are.

But people far smarter than you realized that there were numerous uneducated men in America who want to 'own the libs' and are proud that children being murdered in school doesn't bother them. 

Every country in three world with gun control, has fewer gun deaths.

When the Federal Assault Weapon ban expired, assault weapon massacres skyrocketed.

You think facts and logic are signs of mental illness?

AR style weapons did not become readily available until the 1990s.

What school mass shootings are you referring to that happened, in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s?

    <div class="md">How come we never have a discussion about the 50's-90's where more guns where at schools than any other time in American history and less mass shootings. I don't think there has been a higher proximity of guns near school grounds than during these times. 

Guns have out numbered civilians for the last 70 years, and in the past children/teachers used to drive to school with a shotgun/deer rifle (or both) hanging visibly in the back window of their trucks. What changed in the last 20 years? 

The argument where people say that it's because they where shotguns or deer rifles has some ballistic education they need to undergo. I don't think many people understand just how much damage 3inch shells can do in a shotgun, or how much a 30-06/270/308 can penetrate through targets.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah let’s ban cars too since thousands die every year from cars. Let’s also ban knives for all the stabbings. 

We have a crisis where we aren’t valuing human life like we used to. People are becoming too absorbed in themselves and lack the ability to think outside themselves. All this over some stupid fucking game. It’s just football, it’s just a game. People place way too much value on dumb shit that doesn’t matter. Who gives a fuck who won.</div>

    <div class="md">Ahhh yess the classic hoax politicians love to use that we have a “gun problem”… no. Not even close. We have a society problem. Where traditional values are forgotten and no longer respected. Men become women. Gay marriage is allowed. Single parenthood is encouraged and endorsed by our courts. Jews and arabs are allowed to flood our borders destroying the Christian faith. Mega corporations and the government are destroying out world and everyone is sitting around watching it happen. Most western people don’t even know how to start a fire nowadays if you gave them perfect weather, flint, steel, and the most perfectly dry pile kindling ever bound. 
This world gets fixed by rejecting degeneracy and embracing traditional values.</div>

    <div class="md">We have "collectively realized" it, dozens of times over the last several decades. Then we have the same dumb debates we always have, with the same dumb talking points. The problem isn't that we're continuously failing to realize we have a gun problem, it's that we don't want to commit to doing anything about it. Evoking "children" isn't going to do anything, as children get gunned down in the USA all the time.</div>
