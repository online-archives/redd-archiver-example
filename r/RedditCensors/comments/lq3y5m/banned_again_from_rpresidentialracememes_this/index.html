&gt;Not defending Trump or anything but wasn't ACA like a Republican creation or based off a Republican creation (and Pelosi gets called a progressive for her work in pushing it through) and didn't dems have the supermajority the first two years of Obama's admin and he dropped the public option when he did not need to? Why was that? I distinctively remember a video with him and Bernie back in 2006 where he seemed very progressive and just like Bernie. Yet after his first term, he admitted he would be seen as a moderate Republican in the 80s. Did Wikileaks not show that Citigroup basically picked most if not all of Obama's cabinet? He may be the best president in my lifetime but he most definitely sold out if he wasn't conning the entire time like Trump with his drain the swamp. It's a shame that so many Americans wanted to go back to *that* instead of taking a legit step forward with Bernie and fundamental change that would actually threaten the oligarchic status quo that put us in the position we're in now with leaders of each party putting big money donors and special interests over that of the voters and working class. I almost forgot - Kamala is the most liberal senator and Biden has the most progressive platform ever! /s

&gt;&gt;Next question

&gt;Why do liberals/neoliberals wear a progressive tag, then accuse others of being* grifters for being left of moderate dems and daring to criticize corporate center dems? 

&gt;Edit: Grifters are people who pretend they are something they are not. Like liberals pretending to be progressives. They accuse people (often progressives), as being Republicans and Trump supporters for daring to criticize corporate center dems and trying to hold Biden's feet to the fire. The hypocrisy here is immense and disgusting.</div>

    <div class="md">I didn't go through your full post but right in your first sentence there are two bits of misinformation - dems didn't have a supermajority during the first two years of O's administration, and the public option needed to be dropped because the the ACA wouldn't have passed otherwise.  So I mean, there's that.</div>

    <div class="md">Obama didn't need to drop it but did anyways. You can say it is because it wouldn't pass, and whether that is true or not, does not make what I said untrue. The other part is that dems had a majority in both houses of Congress for two years. Yes, and upon further research technically the supermajority was for about 6 months, so I guess that part is untrue but it is not disinformation, intentional lies to mislead people. The point is they had power to do more then but didn't. They blame it on the filibuster but we all know that Obama was not as progressive as he initially led on and that big money and special interests is why he didn't do more, not just because of republicans/the filibuster. I see misinformation and even blatant lies protecting corporate dems and those users continue posting unabated despite their gaslighting, but I get banned over this? Show me please what part of my comment is disinformation?</div>
