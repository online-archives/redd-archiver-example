    <div class="md">It’s all a shit show. Pick the policies of the candidate and if you believe them and trust them to follow through on those promises/policies. We know what Biden has done with his policies. We know what Trump did with his policies. We know what we will get with either one. Kennedy is an unknown because we haven’t seen him follow through on what he says and his policies. I myself prefer a secure border, energy independence/ cheaper everything and no new wars or funding them. I know exactly who would do that because I got four years of it. If you want to spend billions on a conflict in Ukraine, not have energy independence/pay more for everything and have millions of undocumented immigrants in your country you vote for Biden. Kennedy would be a vote and find out as you don’t know if he will follow through on promises/policies. If Trump chooses Kennedy as his running mate that  would be a huge surprise and possible boost to his candidacy by attracting democrat voters that are fed up with Biden’s policies and behavior.</div>

    <div class="md">I just honestly feel so liberated not having to vote for Trump. I'm so sick of him. Yes, I generally support his policies, but he's a genuine pos and he massively fucked up covid. Everything you just said is one of Kennedy's main goals.

It's nice to talk to someone who doesn't think I'm a bot though...</div>

    <div class="md">I’m not trusting a democrat that parrots Trump to fool me into voting for a democrat. I’m not being fooled by Nikki Haley either because I know who’s funding her staying in the race. I’m going with a proven track record of someone I know will follow through. You mention being a POS and I find that adorable 🤣 As if Washington DC isn’t full of career corrupt politicians with no integrity whatsoever. Like you’re taking the time to take a 💩 on Trump but don’t bother to do the same on Biden is a tell. I’ll never vote for a democrat ever again in this lifetime as they have gone off the deep end. Kennedy needs to put his reputation where his mouth is and denounce the democrat party and switch to republican to make me believe he’s half for real. Nikki has a R by her name but she’s a democrat stooge. You have to be extremely cerebral to see through the lies.</div>

    <div class="md">History will rightly remember today’s violence at the Capitol, incited by a sitting president who has continued to baselessly lie about the outcome of a lawful election, as a moment of great dishonor and shame for our nation. But we’d be kidding ourselves if we treated it as a total surprise. 

For two months now, a political party and its accompanying media ecosystem has too often been unwilling to tell their followers the truth — that this was not a particularly close election and that President-Elect Biden will be inaugurated on January 20. Their fantasy narrative has spiraled further and further from reality, and it builds upon years of sown resentments. Now we’re seeing the consequences, whipped up into a violent crescendo.

Right now, Republican leaders have a choice made clear in the desecrated chambers of democracy. They can continue down this road and keep stoking the raging fires. Or they can choose reality and take the first steps toward extinguishing the flames. They can choose America. 

I’ve been heartened to see many members of the President’s party speak up forcefully today. Their voices add to the examples of Republican state and local election officials in states like Georgia who’ve refused to be intimidated and have discharged their duties honorably. We need more leaders like these — right now and in the days, weeks, and months ahead as President-Elect Biden works to restore a common purpose to our politics. It’s up to all of us as Americans, regardless of party, to support him in that goal.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't know if what you said had any truth to it,  but I recognize a power grab when I see one. 

I alsp do not refuse evidence that challenges my preconceptions, not when there is such a great quantity of it.

He tried to overturn the election results through legal and illegal means.

Republicans pushed a message before the election that "the only way they win is if they cheat", talking about the Democrats, and that they would do this through mail in ballots.

Election day came and when Trump started losing, because in-person ballots are counted before mailed-in ballots and the previous messaging pushed both sides to vote different ways, he tried to "stop the steal", declared himself the winner, and brought up 60+ lawsuits in 11 states challenging the election. Several hand recounts and audits were also initiated.

In December, Trump and his team gathered alternate slates of electors in the 11 challenged states. Something to note here is that Trump and his team lacked any authority to do this, as only state legislatures can gather electors. These "fake electors" then signed and submitted documents to Congress saying that they were the duly selected electors for their state and that they cast their EC votes for Trump.

Trump then pressured Mike Pence to present his fake electors to Congress instead of the actual ones. Jan 6th came, the day of certification for the election, and when Mike Pence didn't "send the votes back to the states", Trump tweeted out that Pence "didn't have the courage to do what needed to be done" and a certain chant started within the rioters.

Trump lost all court cases and is now being charged for this broad conspiracy to deprive millions of people their right to vote.</div>

    <div class="md">Dementia Joe is a bloody disaster and the democrats are willfully ruining our country and that’s what I care about. So I very much wish the election was overturned as I do believe election laws were changed in key states to help the democrats defraud the people of this United States. They couldn’t wait to get rid of him and get back to business as usual and now they got us involved in another conflict to dumb billions of dollars into. Career corrupt politicians with no integrity and their sheep followers don’t care about this country and will not share their true motivations as that would show them for who they really are.</div>

    <div class="md">I do not subscribe to your reality of "alternative facts".

He tried to overturn the election results through legal and illegal means.

Republicans pushed a message before the election that "the only way they win is if they cheat", talking about the Democrats, and that they would do this through mail in ballots.

Election day came and when Trump started losing, because in-person ballots are counted before mailed-in ballots and the previous messaging pushed both sides to vote different ways, he tried to "stop the steal", declared himself the winner, and brought up 60+ lawsuits in 11 states challenging the election. Several hand recounts and audits were also initiated.

In December, Trump and his team gathered alternate slates of electors in the 11 challenged states. Something to note here is that Trump and his team lacked any authority to do this, as only state legislatures can gather electors. These "fake electors" then signed and submitted documents to Congress saying that they were the duly selected electors for their state and that they cast their EC votes for Trump.

Trump then pressured Mike Pence to present his fake electors to Congress instead of the actual ones. Jan 6th came, the day of certification for the election, and when Mike Pence didn't "send the votes back to the states", Trump tweeted out that Pence "didn't have the courage to do what needed to be done" and a certain chant started within the rioters.

Trump lost all court cases and is now being charged for this broad conspiracy to deprive millions of people their right to vote.</div>

But you are right about some things. Your psycho ideology's time is running out. In ten years a whole lot of millennial women are going to be infertile and childless. Gen Z ain't far behind. No one in your hateful society wants to reproduce. 

Conservatives are reproducing. There is a reason why Christianity has been around for 2000 years buddy.</div>

    <div class="md">More alternative facts.

You've lost whatever fight you think is coming.

You're going to continue to lose any future culture wars you engage in. 

History tells us so.

30 years ago you could call people fa*g*ts in public and get away with it. These days? You'd lose your job.

50 years ago, It the ni**er. These days? You'd lose your job and be hounded until the end of your days.

The gays can get married today. 15 years ago,  they couldn't.

You've lost every major culture war....forever.

That's a historical fact.

What makes you think you're going to win this time?

You're welcome to try your 2nd Amendment Solution, if you wish.

The last time some people did that (people you would have more in common with ideologically, than you would like to admit) we killed a whole bunch of them and took their shit (namely by freeing their slaves).

We'll do it again, but only if you insist.

But hey, not ALL is terrible.

We will accept you.

You'll have to learn some manners. Learn to hold you tongue politely. Learn how to function as part of the group.

But on the other hand, we're gonna tax the everyliving fuck out of the billionaires and provide free Healthcare for all Americans and even some people that AREN'T Americans.

Even you.

Come on. We're waiting.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh yea toootttalllyyy

That def explains why Soros backed tons of lefty prosecutors, why Bezos bought the WaPo, why Bloomberg is constantly assaulting the conservative right, why Facebook is pumping millions into "election integrity",  why the vast majority of wealthy people vote Democrat, why the Ivy League is hard left, and why the wealthiest counties in the country are all HARD DEMOCRAT districts. 

It must be because all those rich and powerful people want to pay more in taxes.

God dude, you must have gone to public school.</div>
