      <div class="md">Just like the title say, I received a message saying I was permanently banned from leftwithoutedge, reason: Just constantly posting the worst fucking people and sources. 

I have never received a temp ban there and don't recall ever so much as receiving a warning. I have had a few users there who follow me around, report my posts, attack the content creators and myself over the posts I have made, and rejoice and rub it in my face when they have got a post and or comments or mine removed, even after I had spent hours replying to them in good faith to debate, clearly those types do not care about that or evidence if it challenges their views, but just want to act as smear agents (like Seder/TYT/Vaush left so often does) and work to suppress discourse and censor wrongthink, especially that of anti-establishment anti-war/imperialist leftists who they label as authoritarian tankies, secret right-wingers, Putin (and Assad) assets.

I have posted there for a while and post a variety of content, but seems like when I post stuff from likes of Jimmy Dore, Russell Brand, Michael Tracey, Caitlin Johnstone, Glenn Greenwald, Aaron Mate/Grayzone, Katie Halper, Matt Taibbi, Kim Iverson, Richard Medhurst, Chris Hedges etc (or like Rogan being called far-right when he's an admitted liberal and Bernie supporter), I notice certain users will downvote and comment smearing these folks saying they are all right-wing, grifters and or essentially Kremlin propagandists pushing Russian state propaganda talking points. If I make a post that criticizes the dem party/leadership (even if from the left) or official narrative on Russia-Ukraine for example, it is liable to also get the same treatment. You get the picture. 

This is how so many other leftist subs have ended up, basically clones of the politics sub. Seems less like an actual leftist space open to debate and more like a authoritarian 'leftist' safe space for shit/radlibs who are just dupes of neolib and neoconservative democrats who don't want class solidarity, popular progressive and working class policy, 3rd parties on the ballot, but want the left divided just as they want and benefit from the left and right being divided and distracted from the real war: which is top vs bottom.</div>

    <div class="md">Man, taking a quick glance at that sub, I’m not surprised you got banned. From personal experience, political subs in general don’t really care or want debate. They want an echo chamber. Left, right, center, doesn’t matter. Starting a conversation in subs like that usually isn’t going to work out well.

I guess that just goes for a lot of reddit in general. Not just politics. People don’t want their views questioned or challenged, they just want to be right.</div>
