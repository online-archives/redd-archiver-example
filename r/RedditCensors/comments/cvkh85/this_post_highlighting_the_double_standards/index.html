Post with updated points:

"Penis size" is accepted as a preference women are entitled to, and it's socially accepted. 

"WIBTA if I break up with a guy over his small dick?"

"WIBTA if I ask a guy's dick size on a date before I sleep with him?"

"I'm a size queen. It's fine to have sex with my bf's smaller/average dick, but I need a guy who's willing to fuck me with a 7 inch girth dildo and if he's too insecure about his dick not being enough for me, then that's not my guy."

Both are met with "NTA, everyone is entitled to their preference."

________________________________________________________

Mirror this into the opposite genders for a moment and everyone loses their minds.

"WIBTA if I break up with my girlfriend over her pussy being too loose for me?"

"WIBTA if I break up with my girlfriend over her pussy having too big of a case of outie flaps?"

"WIBTA if I ask girls how tight their pussies are on a date before I sleep with them?"

"WIBTA if I ask girls whether they have roast beef pussy on a date before I sleep with them?"

"I like tightness around my dick. I'm happy to fuck my girlfriend's loose/standard tightness pussy but they better be ready to use a nice tight lubed up fleshlight and if she's too insecure about it, she's not good enough to be my girl."

    <div class="md">This is exactly how all of these anti-male double standards should be viewed.  By considering exact reverse gender equivalents to illustrate the hipocrisy.

It's too bad you were censored at unpopular opinions.  Unless they had a very good reason that I'm not aware of my opinion of that subreddit has gone down.

kurtu5 is right.  We do now live in a gynocentric society.  For people like me who believe in genuine gender equality that is a serious problem.

I have spoken online about many anti-male double standards.  Most women seem offended to even hear a word about it.  On rare occasions I do find women who will acknowledge such double standards but it is rare.

We should not be silent about this stuff.  It needs to change.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah too many subs ban legitimate unpopular opinions because they don't like them.  Other subs bully and shame unpopular opinions relentlessly to achieve the same effect and force a group-think or mob-like mentality.

Either way don't let these things deter you from making sensible comments that bring balance to conversations that would have had no balance otherwise.  More people need to find the guts to make such comments in order for anything to change.  It's way more interesting to do so anyway.  Just be consistent with the facts.</div>

    <div class="md">Is Reddit generally considered to have more male feminists than might be expected?

I have found many particular subreddits that should be somewhat neutral to be extremely unwelcoming and dismissive to pointing out very obvious anti-male double standards.  To the point that they may as well be considered feminist subs.

I hope the entire Reddit site doesn't have a general anti-male perspective.  That would be disappointing to learn.</div>

Not playing coy.  The response to my question was informative and made it well worth asking about.</div>

    <div class="md">If it helps, I'm a woman who totally agrees that gynocentric double standards like this are total bullshit that needs to stop yesterday.

I'm against genital mutilation (i.e. circumcision) for anyone who doesn't need it medically for some reason. I think it's stupid to pick female workers or board members over men just because you're trying to "balance" the team. I believe resumes should be reviewed without names attached to minimize name/gender/race bias. I believe men should be allowed to cry. I believe women should be allowed to rage.

I could go on, but I think you'll get the idea.</div>

    <div class="md">It all started with a discussion about being topless in public that ended with me just saying, "I don't care if you wear a shirt or not. If you (men) can do that, I should be able to too! And if you can't, neither should I."

I really just want everyone treated fairly regardless. Is that too much to ask?</div>

    <div class="md">That sounds more like treating everyone equally, as opposed to fairly. 

For example, society (aside from legally) overwhelmingly grants a free pass to a black person using violence against someone calling them a "nigger". 

Treating everyone equally is:

1. letting anyone use violence against someone calling them a word they don't like, or

2. It's never okay to use violence against someone for mere words (unless they constitute threat or fraud, then it's arguably okay depending on specifics).

Both 1 &amp; 2 treat everyone equally, but only 2 is fair. 

Regarding being topless in public, I think it's okay for both men and women to be topless. That sounds fair. For both to not be allowed to be topless, that sounds unfair. It should be left up to the property owners what rule they set. And if it's public, the decision should be localised as much as possible.</div>
