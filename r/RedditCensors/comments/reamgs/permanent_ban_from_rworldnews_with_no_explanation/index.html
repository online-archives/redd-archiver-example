    <div class="md">Unfortunately, mods can do whatever they want. You can be banned for no reason, you can be muted, they don't need to explain themselves - and keep in mind that if you create another account to circumvent the ban, you risk getting both accounts perma banned.  


You can ask someone to give you the list of worldnews mods and private message them individually - perhaps one of them will take pity on you and you will get an explanation this way.</div>

    <div class="md">I just got perm'd too...no warning...no explanation... I didn't break any of the group rules. The only thing I can assume is that they don't like my political beliefs (conservative). I didn't attack anyone, I wasn't hateful in anyway, I stated my opinion in a respectful manner and was downvoted to hell, verbally attacked, then perm'd. The comments of the verbal attacks were removed, none of my comments were removed but I was banned. I have reached out for explanation but no answer. Censorship should be unacceptable, especially when it comes to a news subreddit?</div>

    <div class="md">There are underlying priorities there and I’m guessing that not all the mods agree with each other but don’t have the time to investigate every other mod’s actions nor would they start undermining each other’s authority.  

Reddit as a company doesn’t care because it’s all just traffic. 

I had previous accounts where I could criticise Israel (within bounds of reason) all I liked and nothing happened. Now it’s all changed.</div>
