    <div class="md">Here's the ban:

http://magaimg.net/img/5wcr.jpg

If anyone can figure out how quoting the article he posted is toxic, please let me know. I'm at a complete loss here...

At least "toxic behavior" is already in quotes. Really emphasizes the ridiculousness of that as the reason.

As the ban suggested, I did go read up on the rule. If anyone is interested, here is the entire text:

&gt;Toxic behavior of any kind is not compatible with the relaxed stoner atmosphere of our subreddit and may result in a no-warning ban. This includes (but is not limited to) trolling, vote brigading, comment brigading, drama brigading, baiting, harassing, taunting, insulting, spoiling, being antagonistic or needlessly bothering users or mods or will not be tolerated. This includes making snide, condescending remarks such as "im14andthisisdeep" or "iamverysmart". Luckily such behavior is rare here, but when it does happen it will result in an instant, no warning ban or temp ban. This even applies to users who are participating in such behaviors towards woahdude or its users from outside the subreddit.

&gt;This also includes racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted comments. Be careful with that sort of language, even if you're "joking". Free speech is a very important and valuable part of democracy. However, this subreddit is not a free speech zone. This is a very specialized subreddit. In a very real sense, it's a safe space for high people. This is why we don't tolerate anything that can harsh mellows (at least not without a BAD VIBES tag). If you want to get angry or talk about touchy subjects, there are many other subreddits better suited for that for you to go to, which we encourage you to visit, especially if the discussion is important to have.
Furthermore we reserve the right to remove users who engage, have a history of engaging, or who are likely to engage in any form of toxic behavior including spreading lies, misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, hate speech, anti-science, radicalism, cult activity or any other hateful, violent, or toxic nonsense in our subreddit or anywhere else.

&gt;Removals and bans may also be issued for violations of reddiquette.

&gt;Reason: We're a subreddit made for surfing while high, and wish to preserve an atmosphere that enhances said high, and won't harsh mellows or cause bad trips.

I guess saying stuff like "Trump selling your wealth and futures so he can line the pockets of the wealthy" somehow *enhances said high* and *won't harsh mellows or cause bad trips.*

And somehow the article does, but only when viewed in its entirety maybe? Or only if /u/rWoahDude posts it? Or maybe it's only when you view the article on the site itself, not on Reddit in a comment. I'm a bit unclear on the specifics. All of this is really quite baffling. </div>
