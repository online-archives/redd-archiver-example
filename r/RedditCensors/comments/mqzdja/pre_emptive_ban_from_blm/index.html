    <div class="md">Oh that sub.... Ill msg the mods a 2nd time before unsubbing myself but it might have just been the one mod who replied to my first msg had a bad day or there is selfish or possibly malacious or even racist intent behind the mod team.  

When you msg mods does every single mod review it or is it like a queue and if some mod marks something done anlther mod who logs on in 8 hours wont review the other mods responses to messages when.they were inactive? 

Anyway i found it rude and also strange it wanted me to go visit the new york times and read an interview? But also didnt provide a link? And why not just give me a copy pasta instead of asking me to search for answers on a 3rd party site??  And why ask me yo read the NY times?  It was a very strange response i got.</div>
