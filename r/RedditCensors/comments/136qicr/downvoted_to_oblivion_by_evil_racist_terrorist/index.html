    <div class="md">umm.. no. You were downvoted because you are spreading false information. Hokkien is part of the Chinese language family and has nothing to do with Polynesian and Dutch other than some loanwords. You claim to have a PHD in linguistics but can't even different between Hokkien Chinese and Indigenous Taiwanese languages. Very strange.

&#x200B;

>The Hokkien (/ˈhɒkiɛn/)\[9\] variety of Chinese is a Southern Min language native to and originating from the Minnan region, where it is widely spoken in the southeastern part of Fujian in southeastern mainland China. In Chinese linguistics, these languages are known by their classification under the Quanzhang division (Chinese: 泉漳片; pinyin: Quánzhāng piàn) of Min Nan, which comes from the first characters of the two main Hokkien urban centers of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou.  
Hokkien is one of the national languages in Taiwan, and it is also widely spoken within the Chinese diaspora in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and other parts of Southeast Asia; and by other overseas Chinese beyond Asia and all over the world

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien)

&#x200B;

How exactly is Hokkien "unrelated" to the languages spoken in China when it ORIGINATED in China in the first place?? 

And how do you identify as Indigenous Taiwanese, but speak Tagolog? What you say makes zero sense.</div>

    <div class="md">Downvoting is a form of censorship because on reddit, a drop in karma may prevent you from posting in certain subreddits.  Or it may cause a 15 minute comment timer to kick in.  Thus limiting your ability to organically conduct a discussion (in many times restricting your ability to debunk other people's bullshit).  When one side dogpiles you and you are unable to respond it is effectively the same thing as restricting your ability to participate in the conversation.</div>
