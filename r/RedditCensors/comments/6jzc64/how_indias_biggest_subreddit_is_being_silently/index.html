    <div class="md">I finally connected the dots on a large measure of why Reddit sucks so hard, and I should have realized this alot sooner. On the non-Reddit internet, the best and biggest discussion forum for Italy is never italy.com, for greece it is not greece.com, the best search engine never was at search.com, etc. But in the bizarro Reddit world the opposite is the case, it matters who gets first to the most pertinent subreddit turf and it doesn't matter how abusive the mods or low-quality the discussion is, being there first is the most important thing on the right subreddit name turf is all that matters here and no matter how toxic the sub is, it will never get unseated by an upstart rival with a lesser namespace. The only counter-example is /r/trees unseating /r/marijuana I believe. 

Thinking more about this, a large part of the reason why is likely because Reddit's internal search sucks so hard and is frequently slow or even disabled when traffic surges. But if you go to /r/blogs or /r/announcements the idiot staff is always focused on useless concerns, features or secret santa type bullshit and not actually righting their sinking ship that always loses revenue and is only gonna get eventually dumped by Advanced Publications. </div>

    <div class="md">I don't think it is a conspiracy or intentional, Reddit staff is just dumb and poorly led. Just check:   

/r/blog     
/r/announcements    
/r/changelog    

And you can see they are not very smart and squandering the last resources of a company that never turned a profit for its investors on nonsense that cannot bring revenue or help Reddit be more than a shitposting, karmawhoring and meme-ing toilet of the internet that few want to support with Reddit gold membership. In other words even if they do make features or policy changes, it is not the type that would make this place high quality for enough people to be willing to give money to support the site. 

Or just search Alexis Ohanian on Youtube to hear how that dunce has a bloated sense that this is a good medium contributing something to the world instead of a pile of refuse taking up the baton from its chanboard predecessors in redpilling the internet discourse for the worse. Here you go:

    <div class="md">Well it is known that the State Dept. asked Jack Dorsey to delay his upgrade so that twitter service in iran would be uninterrupted during their failed revolution in 2009. So it's not exactly far fetched to believe that governments / organizations are working with social media companies to promote agendas, etc. 


At this point, it's a guarantee. Now consider that reddit as a website is the 4th most visited website in the US and the 9th most in the world. There are, whether explicity with the admins or not, forces at work to control the dialogue on reddit.  It's not so far fetched to take it a step further and say that if they are working with the admins, that the admins would make it difficult for users to organically discover alternative subs.</div>

    <div class="md">I definitely think shills are highly active. If you want them to show for sure start writing about GMOs, monsanto, etc. You will see user accounts with no organic post history pop up that just jump from sub to sub to defend agro-chemical giants to reinforce the "but science" circlejerk. See: 

&gt;https://leakofnations.com/monsanto-accused-in-court-of-conducting-an-army-of-shills-to-crackdown-on-negative-online-comments-monsanto-shills-roundup-cancer-link-monsanto-ghostwrite-scientific-articles/

Or you could check out the sub /r/shills. But I don't think that is why Reddit sucks I encounter few people I suspect of being paid to Reddit, Reddit sucks because it has turned into a real life MMORPG for super neckbeards:   

&gt;[Reddit is dominated by neckbeard cliques that organize on IRC/slackchat/discord](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64vqph/reddit_is_dominated_by_neckbeard_cliques_that/)

&gt;Reddit is dominated by perhaps a few thousand super neckbeards who have the most karma, mod between 20-200+ subs, who have the largest clique of "online friends" to game the voting system, aka the unidan effect and silence enemies or karma competitors, and put in more time on Reddit and cultivating these friendship cliques than some of us spend working. Reddit gives too many tools for people with no lives like the voting system, the subreddit system and the ability to create infinite alternative accounts to turn the medium into the "game of Reddit" that they then "win". Which of course comes at the price of losing in real life. 

I actually respect the shills more than the neckbeards, at least I can understand monetary motivation for having sucky opinions.

    <div class="md">You think it is just /r/india? Reddit is dominated by nerd outcasts who camp out in persistent chat clients and push weirdo agendas that don't have much currency in the real world most often. No geographic subreddit represents true to life demographics or popular opinion because reddit is mostly white male chankids, hardcore gamers, IT nerds, etc. and other undesireables. 

The amount of censorship and agenda pushing on Reddit is incredible -- and it all serves one purpose -- so the geeks stuffed into lockers in high school can turn the tides. Reddit just gives too many tools for people with no lives: the ability to be a tyrant by just getting to subreddit turf first, it punishes the brigading on Reddit by casual users, but doesn't even bother to investigate the brigading that hardcore nerds do via persistent chat clients, it has an easy to game voting system, it allows people to create unlimited accounts, etc. </div>

    <div class="md">My argument is plain and you just don't want to hear it because you are one of those who fits in on Reddit(and the outcast core demographic will forgive all the shittiness here and on chanboards because it allows them to upturn conventional society on cyberspace) and acts like the nonsense that goes on here should be normalized. If Reddit was honest they would change their slogan to "the frontpage of the internet for ouctast nerds and geeks." 

Alot of what I wrote can be proven, and I tried to best as I could in this thread from my experiences after entering /r/vegancirclejerk's persistent irc channel, I wrote this eventually:  

&gt;[Reddit is dominated by neckbeard cliques that organize on IRC/slackchat/discord](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/64vqph/reddit_is_dominated_by_neckbeard_cliques_that/)

&gt;Reddit is dominated by perhaps a few thousand super neckbeards who have the most karma, mod between 20-200+ subs, who have the largest clique of "online friends" to game the voting system, aka the unidan effect and silence enemies or karma competitors, and put in more time on Reddit and cultivating these friendship cliques than some of us spend working. Reddit gives too many tools for people with no lives like the voting system, the subreddit system and the ability to create infinite alternative accounts to turn the medium into the "game of Reddit" that they then "win". Which of course comes at the price of losing in real life. 

I supported my analysis as best I could with screenshots from irc showing the vegan redditor nerds were mentioning my username in their persistent chat irc channel numerous times, which explained why I was downvoted so hard in /r/vegan. I even caught an admin writing this gem:  

&gt;We will take action against users that post another user's personal information, either directly on reddit or linking to it off-site. ... **However, we usually cannot rely on screenshots because they are easily faked. If this is all occurring off-site and not being posted anywhere on reddit, then there is usually little we can do** ...

Which essentially means the rules of Reddit are only gonna apply to normal casual users who do their brigading, doxxing actually on Reddit, and they will never apply to the super invested neckbeards who do the same except on irc, slack, discord because they don't accept screenshots from persistent chats as evidence.

    <div class="md">Is this a conspiracy theory that white geeky kids and gamer neckbeards are controlling Reddit to get back at the Chads that bullied them? And that "outcast nerds and geeks" are anything more than random users who post random things every now and then? 

brb, gonna go have a civilized discussion about 9/11 with my conspiracy theorist coworker, you're a fucking tard 

also, of course they're not going to do anything about something that happens on a communication medium entirely independent from a subreddit, that's a power overreach at best</div>

    <div class="md">You are a good example of why the core demographic on this site is a cancer that won't allow serious discussion ever. The only thing people like you can seriously discuss is gamergate and other crap that only Reddit and chanboards care about. I didn't relink the source of the admin quote, that they will only punish doxxing if proven via Reddit not from a screenshot from persistent chats, but here it is:

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/61twfz/i_think_reddits_doxxing_policyrule_needs/dfix6vd/

Which essentially means Reddit rules selectively enforced as they are already, are only gonna be enforced on the least invested regular users. Which allows the superneckbeards to run wild on persistent chat clients where they actually organize and ruin this medium more than it is already ruined. That is how most subs push agendas: one superneckbeard gets there first as a top level moderator on a subreddit turf and fishes a persistent chat client for fellow mega-nerds with the same agenda to help enforce a circlejerk. </div>

    <div class="md">you don't have to use up arrows to reply to me btw

and sure some default subs have a neckbeard or two with no life running them. that's literally the least stable grounds for a conspiracy theory that "superneckbeards" are "organizing" to "ruin this medium". 

anyways I'm a white male geek fucktard but I like to think that I just use Reddit because it's fun to click up arrows on good posts and bullshit around with other people who are just bored in the moment. if I ever become a power user I'm gonna neck myself</div>
