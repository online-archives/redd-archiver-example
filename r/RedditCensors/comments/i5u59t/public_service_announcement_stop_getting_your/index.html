I would say get your news from all sources and then make up your mind but at this stage, reddit is subject to the whim of the moderators who use whichever rule they want in whichever way they want to control output.

I personally was banned from the /r/coronavirus for posting that US death toll is overestimated and included MULTIPLE SOURCES.

    <div class="md">Definitely don't think these subreddits should be banning folks for asking questions but no, it definitely isn't an 'established fact' that COVID-related deaths are overestimated. There's plenty of evidence that current death tolls are actually an underestimate (sources below). I'm curious as to what tiny percentage of car crash fatalities are currently being attributed to COVID-19 but if you succumb to car crash-related injuries because you are immunocompromised due to COVID-19, that would rightly be counted as a COVID-related death

    <div class="md">I don't think they are being over reported. I think there are far more c19 related deaths that are not due to actual infection. Like panic keeping people from medical care, or like a friend of mine (no dead but could have) has a bacterial pneumonia that was treated like Covid until they finally figured it out. And of course suicide from depression because of lockdown. These aren't getting talked about enough. Loss of job, no escape from abuse, isolation are all factors.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't think people are starving to death. My father has been house bound for a couple of years. He's been having groceries delivered and meals on wheels and other such services. In his area those services got banned. Straight up gig economy (his area hated that anyway) got banned, but the way they wrote the order it banned any kind of delivery that wasn't parcel or post. 

The exception seemed to be free delivery. So you could order services to your house like a locksmith or plumber because they aren't charging you separate for coming over. 

My dad lives in a retirement town. The population is 40% over 60. They've shut everything down and rightfully so. So how's my dad gonna eat? This was a genuine worry of his. I almost drove the 8 hrs to his community to stock him up on can foods and shelf stable items.

Fortunately there are as many churches as clinics even though my dad isn't particularly religious. They (not being able to hold services) came door to door proselytizing. The mayor tried to stop it, but it's not like they wore uniforms. They left promptly if asked (or yelled at). 

Anyway, they got to my dad's, house he told the Jehovah's, he told the Mormon's, he told the Baptists, it took them a bit, but even the Jewish temple made it to his house. Initially they each hooked him up with food, but eventually the labor trade people who attended these institutions worked out that they could deliver food. You'd call the church (my dad is sticking it out with the Baptists) then he'd request a "plumbing inspection" from someone on their list. Then some apprentice kid would show up with the groceries and my dad pays with a paper check or card swipe to the plumbing contractor. Lockdown has since been eased and gig economy is reopened and restaurants are reopened at least in part. 

Unless there are places actively preventing agricultural transactions communities are finding a way to bypass their government. 

Btw, the mortality rate in my dad's community is terrible. About 25% are dieing if they get Covid. Much higher than my community that sits at about 0.1%. My dad's community has super slow spread with a population of 60k they've only had about 600 cases.  My population is almost a million and were closing in on 100k cases. Population density? Did my dad's community abandon it when the very strong gig economy was shut down? We can't figure out why this unregulated gig economy they've got going hasn't spread it more.</div>

    <div class="md">Regarding the first source, I don't exactly get their conclusion that the limited access to healthcare reduced the numbers of deaths of other natural causes. And since the reduction is double the covid deaths, where is the other half? Seems like there are actually fewer deaths to other causes.
And are we now talking about US or UK? Since the first source is London and the CARES Act is US.
Recarding the CARES-Act section, it's hard to say what hospitals do, this is no proof for either side. 
And where did the lockdown cause deaths?

It is very unlikely that deaths from heart disease, influenza, dementia and alzheimers, neoplasms (mostly cancers) and all the other top ten leading causes of death should all reduce at the same time. So what can be going on?

A number of experts have warned that to restrict access to the healthcare system could have deadly consequences for significant numbers.</div>

    <div class="md">So you agree the virus is that bad that the normal hospitals could not handle the cases. So there had to be actions taken, and masks, lockdown, temporary hospitals, social distancing were all the things to prevent deaths. 
Since the communication between the hospitals was that bad thank god there was a lockdown. Imagin it whitout it. I mean like the article says even with all these things they were over capacity.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Stephen Crowder has a good 'Change my mind' video on this topic, and he uses difference sources to come to the same conclusion. 

Even he makes good points that we don't have a perfect statistic for every covid case that the death was directly caused by covid and would not have happened whitout it, it bothers me he uses the whole time his "25% are not confiremd covid cases"-statement. While this seems true for New York City, which he also linked in the video, this seems to be a cherry-picked statistic. The CDC-Site has no data for every state, but for the states they have data, the data is up to date and the not confirmed cases are not near the 25% he uses.

The subsidies are economic law, though.</div>
