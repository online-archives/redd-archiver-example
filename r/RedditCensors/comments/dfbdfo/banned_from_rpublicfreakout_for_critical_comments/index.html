    <div class="md">I was permanently banned tonight after recently posting some (albeit offensive but not racist or bigoted) comments telling an obvious Chinese bot  posting propaganda to suck Jinping off. Having never been banned before, I did some research. Normally when you're banned, the mods will provide the comment or post that you were banned for. Not only did they not indicate why I was banned, but they didn't even mention which rule I broke. When I tried to appeal the ban I was muted for 72 hours by the mods with no reply. I'll admit my messages to the mods were heated and impolite but considering some of the vile shit I see that flys on that sub, none of what I said was banworthy imo. Seems extremely fishy considering all the extremely offensive/derogatory posters that are allowed free reign in the sub. I have also said way more offensive things in that sub with no ban (never anything racist bigoted or sexist, just abraisive and confrontational). Seems like r/publicfreakout mods are either censoring negative comments about China or are so soft that they're willing to ban a guy for calling someone retarded and a braindead fuck after saying he loved it that a guy ruined a screening of the joker and spat in peoples face as they were leaving the theatre. That's the only other thing I can think of that could have gotten me banned, that and maybe calling someone commie scum who was clearly shilling for the mainland Chinese government. Didn't think that sub was such cancer but I stand corrected.</div>

    <div class="md">The hypocrisy is baffling to me. There are guys who must be friends with mods and even mods who use homophobic slurs and say racist shit constantly. Mods in that sub have also been called out for bullying people they disagree with. Where's their ban? At this point I'm just whining about dumb fuck inconsistent shit eating mods so I'm just going to shut the fuck up. In conclusion, a big fuck you to the mods over at r/publicfreakout and a bigger fuck you to u/secondsting. Oversensitive banhappy pussies like you are the reason this site's gone to shit. Eat a fat dick bitch.</div>

    <div class="md">Your initial opinion about banning me happens to be an opinion. It's also your opinion that I'll constantly suffer due to this behaviour. You're not too fucking bright are you? Let me rephrase though so you can understand. I don't give a fuck what you think. Oh heavens how will I ever recover from being banned from publicfreakout?? This has ruined me. Not like I can't create another account in 30 seconds and be right back at it. It's cute how much enjoyment you get out of this. I am truly, truly suffering over here.

    <div class="md">&gt; It's the moments where you're alone and should be at peace with yourself, but you aren't. That's when you suffer for who you are...and yeah, it's nice knowing that bad people like yourself are rewarded with pain

Even more projection. Try harder.</div>

    <div class="md">That sub is covered in propaganda *favouring* the protesters every day and criticising the spam in any way gets mass downvotes.  And you're here actually proposing you were banned for being against the Chinese government?  And people are *upvoting* this retardation?

    <div class="md">I admitted I can abraisive and rude. None of this is new information, great comment dude. My issue is with the inconsistent and hypocritical mods who ban some for this behaviour and allow others free reign. This kind of talk is so prevalent in the sub that I assumed it was accepted.</div>
