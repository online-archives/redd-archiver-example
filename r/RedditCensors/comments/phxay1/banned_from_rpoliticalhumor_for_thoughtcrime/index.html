&gt;"Rogan is a sociopath. He doesn’t care about the damage he does as long as he keeps getting paid."

&gt;By taking a medicine that has been prescribed to humans by doctors for years to treat viruses and is currently being used by doctors all around the world to treat viruses, including Covid? Interesting take you have. Surely not biased at all or driven by politics. 🤭

&gt;"Why do people hate Joe? He seems fairly middle of the road and open to listening and talking about both sides. I guess I'm not getting why people are hating on him."

&gt;He did something the TV and the Vice News and Rolling Stone articles on Facebook told those people who hate him not to do. The TV and the Vice News and Rolling Stone articles on Facebook did not give these people context that Ivermectin has been used for years to treat influenza and Zika, among other viruses, that doctors around the world are currently using the human form to treat Covid, and so they are foaming a the mouth and gnashing their teeth. Now they're flailing about because Joe Rogan is testing negative for Covid and is perfectly fine. It's tribalism and impotent rage from people whose attention can be diverted from one thing to the next as easily as flipping a light switch.

~

As always, people should consult their doctors before taking any medication or receiving any kind of treatment, and they definitely should not take anything formulated for animals or do something just because the TV and the government told them to.</div>

By doing this they pretty much admit a majority of Americans are naive and guileless, and don't have much of an independent thought. Otherwise why else would they ban it?

Guilty until innocent.

Perhaps they know the evidence will only convince the person. ;)</div>

    <div class="md">They can't offer any logic, reason or facts to defend their drug company propaganda.

You see it all the time, when faced with facts, the shill will very quickly try to bring the conversation down to the level of a shit-slinging contest.

And the ones  pushing these gene therapy experiments get VERY nasty about it. Even calling for death of anyone not joining the Covid Cult. 

Corporate shills have always been crawling all over reddit. Admins cooperate with them, almost a tradition.

In this case though, they're directly hurting people with censoring legitimate science and spreading their disinformation.</div>
