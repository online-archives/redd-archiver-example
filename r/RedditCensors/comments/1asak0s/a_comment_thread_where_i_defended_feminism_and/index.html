Oh well, no harm no foul. It explains why the entire subreddit is everyone echoing each other and everyone thinks the world agrees with them and anyone who disagrees isn't as enlightened as them and that their think is the only serious conversation out there.

Big Brother watches all of us and waits for us to burn our books--I mean, our thoughts.

Oh, right, link to the thread to add to the evidence (although the person I was replying to apparently is all deleted).

    <div class="md">There should be a report button at the bottom of that message. I'd definitely report it, that's what I do now. Abusing a legit support system just to troll/harass someone, or as a harsher way of saying "seek help" is cowardly, and also against a bunch of reddit rules.

But yeah, stand tall, all they've proven is they big mad, and couldn't even articulate a response.</div>

    <div class="md">I've oftentimes said that a LOT of good social movements with honestly good intentions are always taken over by bullies looking for a way to be themselves without judgment. I've been called a "transphobe" because I called a trans person out on their bullshit and, instead of being accountable that they stole something, they just said "you only blamed me because I'm trans". God, I hate people who use things like that or mental health or anything else as an armor to be a shitty person...

People who call themselves "feminists", people who call themselves "allies" to the LGBT... some of these people are the worst, because all they do is yell and scream and attack anyone who disagrees with them... and the reason they do it is because they have no idea what they actually stand for. They're just a wolf in sheep's clothing who, when you ask about the sheep's history and stance, they just yell "bigot".

I am a feminist (by classical definition). I am an ally. But, I will *not* engage in such activity. That's how you get someone on the fence to become an enemy. The victims these "allies" bully will always turn against us. We have to fight hate with love... and actual love, not the "love" and "tolerance" that social media people pretend to have, all the while intolerantly lynching anyone who's different from them. That makes them no better than racists and homophobes and transphobes themselves.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh, yeah, I've long since accepted that every place is a groupthink curtailed by its mods. I more just posted this to get it out of my system. It's sad to see how these echo chambers (admittedly on both sides, not just the left) make people believe they are right and the world should all agree with them and when they get in real life and people disagree, they screech insults.

I remember on YouTube, someone mentioned "Death by Glamour is not the best song of Undertale and I'm tired of pretending it is" and the comment section was basically "dude, me too, I just never wanted to say it because I was afraid of getting bashed" or "dude, I thought so too, but I always believed if you disagree with someone, just shut up and move on".

Opposition being silenced has really given people such skewed views on the world. :/

I've said many times that the internet and social media was basically "the awkward kids who sat in a corner finding solace with each other while the rest of society marches on" and, with every passing year, I stand firmer on that opinion.</div>

    <div class="md">Cripes! I *gently* disagree with the premise you opposed, in so far that I *don't* think equality is *preferable*, but rather that some form of "complementarianism" would be better suited to the roles of men and women. I can't for the life of me imagine how much *worse* they would see my own position, if yours, which I **easily** call *logical and level-headed* is seen as "misogyny".

If it's any consolation to you, I would say that people who are unwilling to afford others who they disagree with the chance to speak, they are indebted to inadequate preparation a priori catastrophic failure.

That is to say, one who cannot allow their own presumptions be tested in the heat of conversation and vigorous debate, will be unable to withstand a gentle breeze. Weak ideas lead to weak people banning strong voices. When strong voices go, weak people corrode weak ideas into false premise and failed ideals.

That isn't to say that we should somehow *relish* the idea of people disagreeing with us, it's a painful and discomforting thing, but to refuse to even *allow* counter perspective is the fragility of a child's sandcastle; temporary and poorly planned - feeble minded and absent of foresight.</div>

I believe there's a famous speaker who mentioned that there's two types of equality in the world, traditional equality and cosmic equality (that is more commonly known as equity). Personally, in an ideal world, I would agree with you, but I also realize that the world is not ideal so long as humans continue to exist and corrupt any ideal system out there. You would have so many loud shouting matches about the roles of the genders to the point we would revert back to "patriarchy" screaming matches.

Weak ideas lead to weak people banning strong voices. When strong voices go, weak people corrode weak ideas into false premise and failed ideals.

A single thin strand of metal is weak, but twisted together, they form the cables that help hold up suspension bridges. You get enough weak ideas banded together and you end up with a strong movement that's able to stand up to strong ideas (especially when the premise of those strong ideas are unappealing, so many reject them and, therefore do not have many banded together to support it).

That's how I see a lot of social media. A bunch of weak ideas repeated over and over, strengthened with each repetition and new person flocking in.. until the illusion of strength is perceived. But, like the house of cards analogy in My Cousin Vinny, those building blocks are not bricks... just paper thin cards turned at an angle to show stability and strength.</div>

I'm not saying at all that this is you, but rather what they're doing, but ironically this is the core idea of fascism: one stick is weak but bundled together they are strong. That was the whole word-picture that Benito Mussolini used in one of his speeches promoting fascism. It's EXACTLY what they're doing. Which makes it all the more ironic and projecting that they call anyone who disagrees with them "fascists" and as good little antifa, they are totally justified in using violence against everyone else's strong ideas that they deem to be violence and fascism. After all, nothing wrong with punching a "nazi" amirite? 

These people need to be made to sit down, and shut up. And if they try to use violence in the ways they deem it justified, arrested. Their ideas which forego rational debate for violence and suppression are exactly the ideas that Popper meant when describing the paradox of tolerance as "intolerant" ideas that ironically must not be tolerated.</div>

That actually is kinda frightening to think about that I used the same kind of concept as Mussolini used. I just kinda thought about it, 'cause I have to drive over a suspension bridge every day for work and I think about how it's like metallic twine, and I think about how twince, while strong in the form it's sold, is just a bunch of weak strings put together, lol.

I forget the actual person, but Foamy the Squirrel quoted someone from history that once said that the very idea of shouting down anyone who disagrees with them as "intellectual fascism" and as someone who went to war to "fight actual fascism", it sent shivers down his spine to see the same concept of intolerance being fought mentally instead of physically.. or something to that extent.

To be fair, it's not just these people that act like this. It's hard to not say they're justified in how they act when you have people as... equal but opposite as them... in the MAGA Movement. They're two halves to the same coin.

... for a generation that grew up loving The Hunger Games (or perhaps most of them only saw the movies), they're doing a good job being representatives of President Snow and President Coin.</div>

    <div class="md">You're right. Sexists generally don't think that what they believe is sexist. It's really weird actually because they're saying that because OP is a man, they can't possibly accurately represent feminism such that they offer a cogent critique. See, when OP does it, he's not describing modern feminism, he's describing "modern feminism AS DESCRIBED BY MEN..." What similar reading is saying is that he's a man, so his assessment that modern feminism has become a female supremacy movement (it has) is invalid because he just doesn't understand feminism. 

It's a convenient scheme where the other person is wrong simply because you say they are with no need to back up where their critique goes wrong or makes an error. Instead, they're a man, they can't possibly get it - probably because they're part of the oppressor class - and so their critique is invalid. 

It's sexist reasoning on Similar_reading's part and you're defending it. Congratulations, it's actually YOU who told on yourself.</div>

    <div class="md">Wow, wrong on all counts.

I did not read Similar_Reading’s take as applying to all men. Rather, it applied to men whose views are shared with trans exclusionary radical feminists. So all this talk of dismissing men’s views simply because they *are* men must be addressed to someone else. That isn’t what I believe, and I do not believe that is what was expressed by Similar_Reading. 

You, by taking personal offense from a comment aimed at a certain subset of people, admit to belonging to that group. If you think the comment applies to all men, that’s quite an inference but all we can do is disagree.</div>

Of course it could. And that possibility is fully allowed in Similar_Reading’s comment.

Needless to say, even if your point were true, that doesn’t equate to disqualifying men simply because they are men. It equates to disqualifying men and women simply because they believe feminism has become a women-supremacy movement.

Stifling of ideas, sure. Sexist, no.

Oh, terribly sorry. You’re just defending men that share views with terfs for the principle. I agree that does not make you one personally, and withdraw my observation.</div>

    <div class="md">> You just contradicted yourself. The presumption is that rejecting transgenderism is automatically invalid and therefore either the person rejecting that set of claims is either "hateful" or "ignorant". This excuses treating them with incredible bad faith. The same is true of modern feminism at large and men rejecting it.

Firstly, I fully reject your assessment of the premise. At no point does “rejecting transgenderism” enter into the realm of the men’s view. Only when it crosses into the belief of “feminism is a women supremacy movement” do you now have association with “rejecting transgenderism” by way of being ideologically associate with terfs. That does not mean that men who think feminism is a women-supremacy movement necessarily reject transgenderism.

Except they *do* agree with terfs when it comes to feminism being a women supremacy movement, which was specifically the topic at hand.</div>

    <div class="md">Except, I rejected feminism before there even was a "position" on trans-women. I've rejected feminism as it existed 8-10 years ago before and as it's further devolved into this trans-clusionary schism. The issue of trans inclusion/exclusion is irrelevant to whether or not the movement has become "female/women-supremacy" in its modern forms compared to 100 years ago when it began with the suffragettes. You're latching onto the word "female" as if we're being careful in our language to exclude trans-women. That's not a consideration of ours in the context. It doesn't matter if feminists are trans-exclusionary or not to us, both movements have female/women-supremacy as a feature, both movements together are what seems to be at issue as being "feminism" and as a "female/women supremacy movement".</div>

    <div class="md">No friend, it is *you* who are hung up on the issue on transgenderism. Also, I’ve been very explicit about calling it a “women” supremacy movement as to not bring any trans subject matter into the conversation.

As I’ve said before, you thinking that feminism is a women-supremacy movement puts you in agreement with terfs. It doesn’t mean you agree with them on everything, and it does nothing to speak to your position on transgenderism.

This was a disappointing comment to type, because it’s just a restatement of the last.</div>

When was the last time you heard a story of a modern feminist, particularly the ones with a bunch of clout on TikTok, actively take a stand against the unfairness of the custodial system of courts? If the two genders are so equal, why must the male be the one who pays alimony in every instance where the two sides are financially equal? Why must the child automatically go to the mother in every instance where the two sides are equal?

Why is it that most feminists don't push the cruel narrative that the male suicide rate is FAR higher than female suicide rates and try to do more about it?

    <div class="md">Sorry, but when the representative of modern feminism include Claudia Restrepo and Anita Sarkeesian, that's a VERY far cry from Susan B. Anthony and Sojourner Truth. Have either of these ladies advocated for a harsh scrutiny of the court system and how unfair the laws are about custody of a child after separation/divorce? Have either of these ladies cared about how male suicide rate is higher? Do either of these "feminists" care that females still don't have to register for selective service?

Also, there is very much equality in the west. Not sure what inequalities there are left. Females can join the Army Rangers just as much as the men can, provided they pass the exam. The "wage gap" in virtually every field has been proven to be a debunked myth YEARS ago and the term only exists because of the uninformed perpetually peddling the propaganda. Females are slowly starting to play more football (IIRC: the NCAA has a few female kickers for their football teams, although I can't remember which ones they are off the top of my head).

I *am* a feminist, but I am a real feminist... not an insult to the movement like those two, and everyone on social media who acts like them, are.</div>

    <div class="md">>Do either of these "feminists" care that females still don't have to register for selective service?

God you're woefully uneducated. Women's rights activists have been pushing for women's selective service for years

Republicans keep voting no.

https://rollcall.com/2021/07/23/conservatives-riled-up-over-registering-women-for-draft/

From the article:

But Cotton tweeted Friday his opposition to women registering with the Selective Service. 

“Our military has welcomed women for decades and are stronger for it,” he said. “But America’s daughters shouldn’t be drafted against their will. I opposed this amendment in committee, and I’ll work to remove it before the defense bill passes.”

Hawley also tweeted about the issue Friday.

“I voted against forcing women to enter the draft, and here’s why,” he said. “American women have heroically served in and alongside our fighting forces since our nation’s founding. It’s one thing to allow American women to choose this service, but it’s quite another to force it upon our daughters, sisters, and wives. Missourians feel strongly that compelling women to fight our wars is wrong and so do I.”

You don't get to bitch about women not having to sign up for the draft when  Republicans literally won't let them.

>Have either of these ladies advocated for a harsh scrutiny of the court system and how unfair the laws are about custody of a child after separation/divorce? Have either of these ladies cared about how male suicide rate is higher?

Idgaf about either of these idiots. Modern feminism addresses and acknowledges these issues. If you dont then you're a radfem Terf and it an actual feminist.

You don't get to point at terfs and say "that's feminism"

The equivalent is pointing at the Qanon Shaman and saying he represents All Republicans

Refusing to acknowledge that is being academically dishonest, purposely disingenuous, and YES, misogynistic.

You don't get to paint all feminists as radicals to justify your mysogeny.

>Also, there is very much equality in the west

Demonstrably false.

>Not sure what inequalities there are left. 

Reproductive rights. Healthcare...

Republicans are trying to end no fault divorce because they hate that women have rights and can just leave a marriage whenever they want

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/09/no-fault-divorce-laws-republicans-repeal/675371/

Women in the USA have no legally mandated maternity leave. Literally every other OECD nation does.

To name just a few issues.

>I *am* a feminist, but I am a real feminist

Lol no you're fuckin not bud. Completely uneducated on the topic and have no idea wtf an actual feminist even is. 😂</div>

    <div class="md">The problem is that you have a very ignorant understanding of feminism, or don't understand it at all. Completely uneducated take on your part.

Comes across as purposely disingenuous (nobody is this stupid, they're trolling) and misogynistic.

You literally have to be pretty blind and willfully ignorant if this is your honest opinion.

You don't understand feminism. Straight up. Based on your comment, you seem to be arguing against rad fems (radical Feminists) who are basically just Terfs because nobody is actually a rad fem. If you are you're an idiot.

They are the underwhelming MINORITY that incels use to justify their mysogeny (basically what you did in your comment)

They're constantly propped up as the figureheads of feminism by the right to justify attacking ALL feminism, even though rad fems aren't considered legitimate feminists. -AT ALL-

This ignorance of what actual feminism is, is perpetuated by right wing actors.
This ignorance is what led to gamergate and the popularity of hating on "sjws" in the mid 20 teens

Actual feminism addresses the suffering of BOTH sexes. Calling attention to the culture of toxic masculinity and how men suffer from it, how the patriarchy harms them and promotes a cycle of hatred of men and violence towards women.

Actual feminism promotes FEMINISM literally, as in acting more feminine and that being okay for men. There's tons of intersectionality with the LGBTQ+ community, the black community, and men.

Actual feminism isn't "women's rights" modern feminism is  promoting human rights and human decency with the understanding that our current issues are a result of the problems caused by the patriarchy.

Beyond that, your comment IS objectively ignorant. Woman haven't achieved anything close to equality in the West. They literally just lost their right to healthcare. Women are dying and being imprisoned for their completely natural, biological functions (having miscarriages) in the United States. 

Women with autoimmune diseases like lupus and psoriasis are now banned in certain states from taking the only drugs that alleviate their symptoms (like methotrexate) because they *can* be used as abortifacients (things that cause abortions) even though they're not even pregnant. 

Meanwhile men with the same conditions can take that very same medication with no restrictions for no other reason besides they are men.

There are NO alternative medications. Methotrexate is the ONLY drug capable of treating many autoimmune conditions.

So regardless of your opinions on abortion, women are demonstrably being denied healthcare by a metric EVERYONE agrees on. But I digress.

Abortion is healthcare. That is an objective statement. It is settled science. It is not debatable. 

Until this objective fact is acknowledged by laws and rights, women DO NOT have equality.</div>

    <div class="md">After scrolling through TikTok and seeing hundreds of misogynistic videos from ‘modern feminists’, it’s hard to say that the meaning of it hasn’t been tainted over time. Definitions DO change over time, and I am a feminist in all the ways it used to mean, I believe in equality, sometimes so much, my partner calls me an idealist at times (though I believe it can only ever be an idealist that will be able to fix everything).

But many of the louder voices these days wearing the tag ‘feminist’ these days have actually made me feel sick to my stomach. I mean, they are only the female equivalent to Andrew Tate, so it’s not like we don’t have Male versions, but both of those sides make me fucking sick, and neither of those sides will benefit either gender in the long term.

These are just the differences I have personally witnessed and experienced recently, and I have noticed a change in how frequently I stumble across it.</div>
