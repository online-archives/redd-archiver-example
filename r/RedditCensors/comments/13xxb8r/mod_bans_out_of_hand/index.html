      <div class="md">So I posted in optometry asking a very basic question of whether Zenni optical's online PD measuring tool is accurate. My question was removed without warning and I got a message (I tried posting the image, this sub doesn't allow it) saying I was banned from the community for violating rules of the sub or whatever... I reported for harassment and replied to them "Reported for harassment" which must've triggered them because they then replied that I was now blocked from responding to them.

🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂😂

I reported them again. 

Odd item kinda related... Just a couple days ago the UKlegaladvice mods banned me for giving an "opinion not based on the law" and how it wasn't allowed (nevermind that there are tons of opinions on there.) I reported them for harassment and got a message from Reddit telling me the account WAS found to have violated policies. Is that for real? Any idea what Reddit does to them, if anything?</div>

    <div class="md">It looks like the optometry subreddit has fairly strict rules regarding posting on their space. The ban may have been a little heavy handed, but I can see how they might of concluded that you aren’t capable of meeting their required standards. 

Where I’m getting stuck is how that rises to the level of harassment and what you’re hoping to achieve with that report, can you walk me through that?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm okay with having a post removed for not following their rules, it's annoying but respected. This whole communism inspired skip being civil without just cause and then just banning is beyond ridiculous. It's harassment in my opinion. Their response by blocking me from communicating further (which I wasn't going to do) just seals the verdict for me. That's my feelings at least.</div>

    <div class="md">You’re using words in this reply that I believe you don’t know the definition to. I’m willing to accept that I might be wrong about that, could you define “communism” and “harassment” so I can understand the argument you’re trying to make?

Also, you didn’t say what you hoped to achieve by reporting them, could you address that too?</div>

    <div class="md">Presumably you made this post to open a dialogue on the merits of the interaction between the mods over at r/optometry and yourself. I’m saying that I, for the most part, understand their position but not so much with yours.

If you’re unwilling or unable to justify your position and instead simply wish to deflect with an admittedly witty gestapo comment, then I suppose my presumption was wrong. 

So which is it?</div>
