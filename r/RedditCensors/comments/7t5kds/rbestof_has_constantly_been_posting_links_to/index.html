    <div class="md">Email the mods and ask which rule you broke. If they can cite a rule that actually makes sense and isn't them just throwing a dart at their rules, then it's you breaking the subreddit rules.

If they can't, that censorship. Message the mods and ask why you were banned.

Also, yeah, that sub is garbage. I unsubbed a few months back. It's like r-pics now where "Le Drumpf" is apparently a genuinely great picture and is by no means only being allowed up because of the mods' agenda. </div>
