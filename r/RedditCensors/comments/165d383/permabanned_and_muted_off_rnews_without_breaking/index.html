    <div class="md">How do you know it wasn't this comment that they saw as trolling?

>Societal pressures and expectations of men causes this. It’s the world expecting a man to be an all governing patriarch for their family. Most societies are built upon this expectation… the same way that women are expected to be caring mothers.

>We have to change. Or men will keep violently killing themselves and others.

or this one?

>You said 9/10. So women do it too.

>Your point is useless in this argument. Blaming the man for simply being a man and saying men are the cause of all this violence severely understate the brutal mental health crisis going on in the US. Specifically with millennial men. We’ve built this expectation of men to be caretakers and protectors of their family. Patriarchs that govern the family unit. A loss of a child challenges every facet of that and this man felt he had no where to turn expect to this violence.

>We can keep blaming men for all the worlds problems, instead of actually trying to prevent these violent thoughts and actions before they occur. And you are not helping that cause, you are making it worse.</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit is infested with narrative handlers from power centers shaping our reality. Who's even allowed to comment on r/news anymore after covid and the war in ukraine? They culled anyone with dissenting opinions years ago, so now it's only phony dissent that they can caricature. This site has been gone, and even this sub is just paid thugs manufacturing a false sense of consent for mass censorship & psy-ops.</div>

    <div class="md">I can't find the specific thread now, but there was a discussion on one of the meta-subreddits like r/ModHelp where the r/News mods wanted to have the Karma requirements be a 6-month old account and 40,000 comment Karma.

That is a very high karma requirement.  They claim that it's to get rid of spam, but I don't think it actually makes sense.  As of 2022, the average karma on Reddit typically hovers around 1000, give or take.  And most people have Link Karma, not comment Karma.  40,000 Comment Karma ensures that either you have to be a Power User who got there by conforming to the narrative, or you have have bought a Power User's account.

Another thing I saw was that there were a lot of pro-Ukraine accounts that got manually approved by moderators.  There were also a lot of old accounts that suddenly come back online, indicating that they were purchased from other people.

Reddit is supposed to crack down on the latter practice because it often serves as a source of spam. However, in cases like the Ukraine War discussion, it appeared that Reddit didn't enforce these rules as rigorously just as long as the posters were pro-Ukrainian. A similar phenomenon occurred after the events of January 6th, where a ton of dormant accounts suddenly became active again after more than 8 years of inactivity.  Those accounts weren't just saying, "We need to punish the people who rioted," but they were advocating for drastic measures beyond that, such as advocating for lengthy sentences for anyone remotely connected to the event.

Now I do support the Ukrainians and I believe that there were people who got way out of line on Jan 6th, but even then it was impossible ignore such extreme astroturfing.</div>

    <div class="md">I got permabanned today from r/amitheasshole for creating a post which the mods didn’t believe. The post was 100% real but they banned me because “we don’t believe you ever had a girlfriend” - even though I posted 18 days ago in r/birthcontrol for people to recommend some birth control options for me and my girlfriend.

Imagine being that sad of a human being that you consider having a girlfriend as extremely unlikely. My post wasn’t even out of the ordinary, it was pretty reasonable. What I do is just move on and mute the subreddit, these mods have insane power trips and ban because they literally want to. I can just imagine the creature that the mod that banned me must be to ban me because he didn’t believe I had a girlfriend. 40 y/o 400 pound virgin type sht.</div>
