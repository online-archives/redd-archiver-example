    <div class="md">The reality is this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyBHTTqb38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQyBHTTqb38)  


There, almost 2 hours of full, unedited context for you to watch.  


Black Hate Preacher spouts hateful and racist rhetoric at everyone, including other black people. At one point, he repeatedly called a black student hanging amongst the MAGA kids an "N-word".   


Hate Preacher mocks Native American's beliefs, chiding them for "worshiping Eagles, the Phoenix, and the Buffalo".  


Hate Preacher makes what could be construed as threats of violence toward the White people in attendance, and repeatedly mentions America's impending nuclear destruction.  


MAGA kids mostly stand idly by, watching, making goofy faces, and occasionally responding, but from a distance.  


Hate Preacher rejects the offer of a hand shake from a MAGA kid and says if he had (something, unsure what he said) in his hand, he'd throw it at him.   


Eventually, Native America and Vietnam Vet Nathan Phillips and a few others wander over to the MAGA group, who are SITTING, beating his drum and chanting. The MAGA kids stand and start jumping up and down, chanting and cheering. Phillips walks right up to the one kid seen in the infamous photo, within 1-2 feet of him. The kid NEVER moved.  


Phillips, who has used his drum and chanting and multiple marches and events in the past, finishes his display and moves on - nobody stops him, nobody follows him. The MAGA crowd remains in place.  


The MAGA group did not say or do anything overtly racist or disrespectful - it can only be assumed that their engagement with Phillips by chanting and cheering was mockery, which it very well may have been, who am I to say?  


Hate Preacher resumes using racial slurs such as Cracker, Corn Bread, Whitey, etc, calling the MAGA kids inbred trailer trash, and so on.   


The media narrative that the MAGA kids descended upon this Native American man is a straight out lie, because they were SITTING DOWN when Nathan Phillips approached THEM and stood within 1-2 feet of the kid in the photo, right in his face. The kid had a goofy, smug look on his face, but didn't say a word, didn't make any gestures, and even nodded a few times. I've looked similar to that kid when people are singing happy birthday to me.  


The media narrative that the MAGA kids were disrespectful and were mocking Nathan Phillips has merit. That is entirely plausible although as I said, the lack of any overt comments or gestures being made by the MAGA kids suggests that they possibly thought they were "participating" in Phillip's demonstration.  However, appearances are everything and it certainly appears that they were mocking Phillips, which is unacceptable.  


The media does not, in any story that I can find, mention the OVERT racism being spewed by the Black Hate Preacher, who used "the n-word" in a derogatory fashion at one of the black kids in the MAGA group (whom the MAGA group surrounded to protect from the hate preacher), or the numerous racial slurs he used toward white people, or the mocking, insulting language he used toward the Native Americans - ridiculing their culture and beliefs.   


So, when people say that the media has an agenda to push, this is what they're talking about. This is EXACTLY what they're talking about. The media has carefully sliced this story to tell a narrative that suggests a group of White Catholic Trump supporters surrounded and harassed a Native American War Veteran for no reason.   


Whether the kids mocked Nathan Phillips or not, now THAT is something worthy of debate. But any media outlet claiming they surrounded and harassed Phillips is FUCKING LYING.  


The 2 hour video above PROVES that narrative is an absolute lie.   


I truly hope you watch it.

He won't.  Most these guys who demand proof, citations, context, etc. Are just doing it to waste your time.   They only read headlines and refuse to read/watch the full context of the content.   

If they can't spend 5minutes to do their own research they won't spend 15min to read an article or 2hrs for a video.</div>

    <div class="md">This works out perfectly for them.


Look at the coverage of the Women's March. No mention of anti-semitism, no coverage of Sarsour's boycott comments, or the promotion of the Quran (at an event that welcomes ALL religions supposedly) but they sure did cover those protest signs.


Now look at the March for life coverage. You only get two things. Ben Shapiros harmless baby Hitler quip, and the manipulated covington footage. 


The media wants to frame one side as rational, even wheb they aren't, and another side as irrational, even when they aren't.

I feel like "be faster" is a bad faith reply. It discourages good faith, reasoned, balanced, and researched grass roots journalism, and encourages a "fire from the hip, be first" practice, that sacrifices accuracy to advanced narrative.

Where is the place for long-form, traditional journalism?</div>

    <div class="md">Just going to focus on [a top comment there that got six silver, two gold and a diamond.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/ahw8sa/whats_going_on_with_the_maga_kid_and_the_native/eeiwi0l/)

What I find most interesting about this comment is that it adds literally nothing to the story, and confirms nothing.  The guy openly admits that he didn't see what happened.  He's just some anti-white, anti-christian activist who happened to be in DC at the time.

&gt; Earlier I had noticed the indigenous people's march moving toward the Lincoln Memorial, but I didn't really know who they were or what they were about until way afterward when the video came out.

So he didn't know what was happening until the story came out (just like everyone else.)  But fyi the confrontation took place after 5 PM.  The Indigenous People's March took place from 8 AM to 4 PM, so in regards to the law the march was actually over already when this took place.

&gt; I didn't see the actual mobbing of the Native American guy (Nathan Phillips)

He again confirms that he didn't see what happened.

&gt; Did they shout Build the Wall at Nathan Phillips? Seems like it!

We have a livestream video proving that this never happened.  I just find it funny that he can't say "yes" because he didn't actually see what happened so..."Seems like it!"  lmao

&gt; Did they shout Build the Wall? Yes I heard them chant that, although not for any particular reason. This was before the Native Americans were at the memorial I think.

He also contradicts his own timeline.  If he heard people chanting "Build the Wall" before the Native Americans were at the memorial, then how the hell is it possible that it "seems like" they chanted it at Nathan Phillips?  According to his own testimony, Nathan hadn't arrived yet when the chanting occurred.

&gt; Nathan Phillips....tried to get through a massive field trip group made up of students from Covington Catholic High School, a private men's prep school in Covington, KY (that mostly serves rich families from uber rich suburbs of Cincinnati). The students started taunting and jeering him, **at one point shouting 'Build that Wall!' to drown out his singing and chanting**, and according to Phillips one student in particular got in his way and refused to budge, making Phillips stuck. The video of this, with the students heckling Phillips and the one student smiling smugly the entire time while doing so, went viral. 

And this is the meat and potatoes of his testimony. 

Coincidentally, it's all stuff you would get from reading the news and adds nothing additionally that an eyewitness might have seen.  Strangely, he also contradicts his own timeline yet again to include the "build the wall" chanting at Nathan Phillips, which we now have video debunking.  In short, this is a load of garbage, probably entirely fictional and yet...exactly how r/OutOfTheLoop wants people to believe.

Disgusting.</div>

    <div class="md">/outoftheloop is just as much a cesspool of Shareblue propaganda as /politics is.

Every other thread is a brigade of rabid far-left disinformation. It is constant and consistent.

Absolutely disgusting how reddit admins use their platform to spread such dangerous lies and hate speech. 

I got banned for calmly pointing out this fact.  Not being mean, no rules  broken, just stating the absurdly obvious.

Those kids were completely innocent.  The native Americans were spewing racial slurs at them and getting up in their faces. 

The corrupt MSMedia responsible for this smear campaign need to be held responsible.  

This included propaganda publishers such as reddit, youtube, facebook, twitter, etc.  

The assholes have whipped up an army of incredibly angry NPCs, and they are dangerious. 

Hopefully it them killing someone with their manufactured outrage and brainwashing propaganda.

Absolutely enemies of America.</div>

    <div class="md">The exact same thing happened in r/atheism. There were 2 threads about it, both of which they locked, then they removed any post that didn't condemn the kids as racist shits, then pinned a post saying that they'd removed "racist apologia". 

I used ceddit to look at the removed posts and the bulk of them were people posting links to either the full video of the event, or YouTube commentary videos that go against the mainstream media's narrative. 

I pointed this out and was perma-banned from the sub and muted.

Also, the same mods are locking and removing posts/comments about those black Israelite guys - the ones making homophobic and racist comments in the video. I'm sure you can hazard a guess as to why the mods of an atheist sub would want to defend a group of homophobic and racist religious nutjobs.</div>

    <div class="md">Good Lord, have you ever visited /r/politics?  They permit no “honest discussion involv[ing] both sides” and the name of that sub could not seem more neutral.

Reminder of the scene in 2016:  first half of the year overwhelmingly pro-Bernie anti-Hillary sub, then after Hillary finalized her theft of the primary from him, virtually overnight that place became a zero-dissent-allowed locked-down Hillary-or-the-highway zone.

It was and remains a total joke and if you disbeieve me then go post there something pro-Trump and see how open and honest a discussion you get.</div>
