That other mod then permanently banned me from P_R and with reason: doxxing

I don't see how me correcting them and calling out their censorship, is doxxing and I can't even reply to the mod message to dispute this accusation.

That subs censorship/mod abuse is well-documented: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/ry9w2q/muted_from_rpolitical_revolution_for_28_days/

Please don't brigade, vote/comment in np threads, this sub and those threads are just for documenting mod abuse.

Edit: Also, saying anything positive about Tulsi over at DemocraticSocialism gets you downvoted. Defending her from smears gets you censored by automod or at least one mod who opponely parrots these smears. Saying anything in favor of Force The Vote, also gets you downvoted, even when giving good faith answers to those inquiring about the pros and cons of FTV. I sometimes need to wait 3 days to get a comment approved and mods won't approve comments (autoremoved without reason) if it is an opinion that they disagree, like on Tulsi for example. Not a Tulsi stan, just tired of seeing her smeared, just as I am tired of seeing Rogan smeared.

And this: https://np.reddit.com/r/DemocraticSocialism/comments/sglkku/nice_military/ appears to have been removed. No reason given.</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit does indeed fail when it comes to this.  People can't seem to put ego away and enforce one sided views, whether justified or not. (Definitely not justified in this case.)

When things like this happen I often find myself placing my perspective in their shoes.  It's only then do you realize just how miserable these people are.</div>
