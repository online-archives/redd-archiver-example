    <div class="md">This is the comment that got me banned. The link shows the video.

&gt;Protestor from Melbourne, Australia seen speaking to police in a calm manner when another officer approaches him from behind and slams his face to the ground. You can hear when his face makes contact with the tile. Apparently, he became unconscious afterwards.

    <div class="md">That's awful, I know how it is. I got permanently banned from r/NFL for simply trying to explain why *some* players *might* be against being forced to take the vaccine. I didn't take a personal stance, I didn't say they were right, all I said was "maybe this is why they feel this way" and that and that alone got me a permanent ban even though it was a first "offense".

When I messaged the mods about it, they just muted me.

The Left's fascism and utter political intolerance is ruining Reddit, and society in general.</div>
