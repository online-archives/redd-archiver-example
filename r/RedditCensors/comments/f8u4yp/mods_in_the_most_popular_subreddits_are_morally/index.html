People who moderate the most popular subreddits are usually involved in some other sexualized, political, or agenda driven sub-reddit. This can range from politics, transgender, homosexual, furry, and other vulgar places dedicated to providing this content to these people.

What I've noticed is a unique trend of people who are intellectually, and morally dishonest. They're involved in, and are high ranking authority in sub-reddits that pretty much confirm what type of people they are. They are here to push an agenda, they do not care if you broke the rules or not. They care if their agenda is being pushed. Reddit will always be corrupted when there's control of the most popular sub-reddits by biased, partisan driven, and morally corrupted people.</div>

    <div class="md">Its not even wishful thinking.  The first amendment doesnt apply here.  At all.  The first amendment says the government cant restrict speech (except for a few specific situations).  Reddit, and sub-reddit moderators are not the government therefore they are not in any violation of the 1st amendment.

I'm all for free speech, but I'm not going to call this a 1A violation.  The gist of this post is absolutely correct but this is not a 1A issue in the slightest.  We need to come up with some other way to frame it.   There needs to be another mass exodus from this site, just like the way it was created.</div>

    <div class="md">True, BUT:

Reddit is a Platform, so they aren't supposed to be curating information (aside from law breaking stuff or spam)
The blurred lines of what is "rule breaking" is how they get away with this.

It is so important that this stuff gets resolved, otherwise next election they will have the internet so locked down that you won't be able to find a single opinion other than what they want you to see and think</div>
