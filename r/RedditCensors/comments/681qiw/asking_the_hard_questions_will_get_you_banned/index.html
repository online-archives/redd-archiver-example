When asked the question on whether they'll continue on, on a path that supports free speech, of if they'll go down the same road as Twitter, Facebook, Google and start censoring what they don't like, no answers are given. Instead I as the OP was banned. I think they'll remove the thread soon enough.

    <div class="md">You could use that rhetoric but that doesn't really further the discussion at all.

The reason, as I see it at least, is that all large companies are forced to pander towards their largest audience in order to make money and stay afloat. As of now, their largest (and, for the most part, most vocal) audience is that of the average American democrat. One of the characteristics of that group of people is that they see unhindered free speech upheld by a company like discord as that company *supporting* all ideas, regardless of their merit. That is, the average American isn't concerned about free speech, but rather just free speech for *themselves*, which is a serious fucking issue if you ask me. But relentlessly and ruthlessly insulting a group of people is only going to divide their views and yours farther apart, when you should really be working together to try and come to a consensus as to what and why free speech is important.</div>

    <div class="md">It's not that they're unable to, it's that they operate in an environment where the path of least resistance is going along with everyone else. If you ban controversial content, you're golden, and only nazis and freaks will protest. If you keep it, you expose yourself to endless barrages of media fire courtesy of the SJW dominance in it. Just look at the recent Youtube-WSJ debacle: Youtube lost literally billions because of the moral panic created by the WSJ's article.

Modern censorship works by making it very difficult to run a major service without bending to SJW requests. It's not impossible, but if you have any ambition of making money then good luck.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean, on one hand, it's like, yes, free speech is important and an infringement upon that free speech is bad. However, they aren't "infringing" on your free speech, they are just removing the platform, if that makes sense. You still are allowed to say what you like, just discord can suppress what you say on their platform. Be it advertisers, or board members, they want to make their platform as appealing as possible, which means that if it comes out that certain "public undesirables" post "questionable content" that isn't illegal under law, but is undesirable content to them because they feel it promotes a specific message, then they will remove it. 

Best case is to either deal with the rules they've put in place, or find a different hosting platform. I agree, it isn't a good thing to selectively censor items on a platform even if they do own it, but in the end, they do own it. They have the right to moderate what does and doesn't sit on their platform. </div>
