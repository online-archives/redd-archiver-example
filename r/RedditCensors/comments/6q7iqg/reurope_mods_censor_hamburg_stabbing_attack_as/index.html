Yes. They hate their country and can't wait to have Daddy Soros take over everything including changing their diapers. 

They are man-children. All leftists are. They don't want autonomy. They want a paternal state to be their new parents as their real ones get older. </div>

    <div class="md">My parents were going to Europe this summer and changed their minds when the religion of peace started killing people again. The travel agent said that they will only get a full refund on the package is if another terrorist happens a month before they go. I'm betting they will get all their money back. So does Europe want to be hush hush so it doesn't hurt the tourists dollars? I'm sure it plays a huge part.</div>

    <div class="md">There was one guy a few months ago who is going around claiming that a small number of power mods who controlled hundreds if not thousands of subreddits were actually Muslims. Amongst the subs controlled by these power mods where most of the political subreddits and most of the European subreddits. I cannot verify that any of this is true but judging by how quick they are to protect Islam I wouldn't bat an eye if it came out that was all true.</div>

    <div class="md">They just want to show they hold the  ~~wrong~~ '*right*' (*approved*) opinions ... even when these are shockingly idiotic. 

Being perceived as having the '*right*' views has real-life impact in corporate-controlled societies, in terms of getting along with one's boss(es), getting promoted (or even keeping one's job), having normal (non-marginal) friends (who're under the same pressures) etc.

These mods are just cowardly weasels, nothing more evil.

At least the situation is  better (much) than in autocratic societies (think  North Korea) , so cheer up.</div>

    <div class="md">They most likely are Muslim or pedophiles or communists or hardcore liberals(aka western genocidal maniacs). All they care about is protecting Islam/pedophiles, communism, and western genocide. That's literally the goal of globalism and the left. Everything they do is for those 3 reasons and those 3 reasons alone, anything else is to virtue signal.   
  
They insert themselves (usually through deception, lies, and weasel sociopathic tactics, or another member of their 'club' pulls strings get them in) into every major information outlet in the world. Tech companies in Silicon Valley, editors in Hollywood, journalists at msm, and the swamp in Washington.  
  
It wasn't always like this, but the deepstate/CIA slowly creep their brainwashing (twitters jack used to not be an elitist pussy, Google wasn't always censoring everything, Facebook wasn't always a giant advertisement, and YouTube wasn't always mass mind control), slowly bring in shills (google, Washington, apple, msm) while slowly getting rid of 'troublemakers' (Obama character assassinated or blackmailed countless journalists with the help of brennon and clapper), or they push out the creators/entrepreneurs/visionaries that created the companies(Aaron Schwartz, Steve jobs, oculus rift creator, Linux creator or most recently John macafee) then they suddenly contract cancer, commit suicide or get tied up in legal litigation that drains them to nothing.  
  
In fact one judge in Texas refused to let this guy who owned over 150k internet domains have a lawyer, then took away his rights completely because he tried to get a lawyer 48 TIMES and after each lawyer spoke with the scum of the earth judge he said he would only rule in favor of a local lawyer, so naturally the outsider lawyers would say "this case is unwinnable im out." Well this dude legally became a slave to the courts and lost every single dime to his name. Turns out it was google the whole time using their ties to government to outright steal the domains off this guy.)  The Bourne legacy depicts how the deepstate CIA infiltrated all the tech companies.</div>

1) Hey guys, how do we handle this problem from a lot of the immigrants?

2) Well, you can't really. Trying to handle it might radicalize them. So we just shouldn't really do anything at all. Good luck!</div>
