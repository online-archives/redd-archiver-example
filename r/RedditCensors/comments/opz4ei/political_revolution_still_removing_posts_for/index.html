Edit: They removed https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/obw2x6/if_youre_furious_that_bill_cosby_is_walking_free but reinstated it after protest (still locked) unlike the above.

Edit: They also don't seem to like content about Assange.

Edit: So this was removed:

But not:

What sense does that make?

This post below was flaired as misinformation within a half hour and removed:

This post below (which was posted after the above post and was for some reason removed immediately by automod) was approved just shortly ago, 5 hours after I messaged the mods and 12, almost 13 hours after I posted it.

^ removed despite their entire front page being littered with Manchin posts just like the politics sub. It makes sense then for them to want to censor someone who points out the inconcenient truth about Biden, Pelosi and Manchin. 

But they left this up (at least it is up at the time of writing this):

Just a reminder that they allow YouTube links and have kept up links of Kyle Kulinski and Krystal Ball. Seems like when these commentators criticize certain democrats and narratives, that is when the video is removed by mods.

Flaired as 'misinformation,' locked and removed:

How can any post here sit at 0-1 despite it documenting so much blatant censorship? My guess is users who are actually pro-censorship and here to suppress the above people/narrative and documenting of said censorship.

Mod pinged me and wrote in the thread:

&gt;u/karmagheden really? I know you know better!

I replied with:

&gt;??? We musn't post anything critical of Biden or his covid position/response?

&gt;Also, when are you going to reply to my modmail inquiring about all the censorship happening on this sub? Is this like a case of mods being infiltrated by dem operatives/neoliberals/fake progressives or is just mods are brainwashed by dem establishment propaganda and get off to censoring any content and voices that go against the establishment narrative, that are too critical of dem leadership, that seek to hold leaders accountable, that pokes holes in their propagandistic and smear campaign talking points directed at anti-establishment anti-imperialist leftist? I mean in any case, it's disgusting and you're part of it.

They replied:

&gt;Dude stop drinking the Kool-Aid. You are smarter than this.

I replied: 

&gt;Um, I saw what happened to sandersforpresident and what happened to politics, politicalhumor and presidentialracememes, not to mention democrats, progressive and liberal. Now you're seeing some of the same modding at lostgeneration and alltheleft. What kool-aid are you referring to exactly? Because I've documented the censorship and astroturf is a thing, as is vote manipulation and content being reported in bad faith to get it removed, just like there are tyrannical mods with an agenda. Frankly, whether you or any of the other mods are on the job or not, you are doing the dem establishment and oligarchy a favor when you censor and suppress healthy debate, you know the same people who do not share our progressive ideology, but you consider yourself a leftist? Where are your critical thinking skills? Maybe you're the one drinking the kool-aid, did it ever cross your mind?

They replied: 

&gt;Healthy debate is fine but you are spreading misinformation. That’s not OK.

I replied to that with:

Where? Point it out, please. You mods have removed dozens of posts of mine and not a single time would you explain what is false information. I'm sure I could look through the front of the sub covering the last month and find off topic, propaganda and misinformation that is up, but that's fine because that stuff doesn't conflict with your bias, it serves the dem establishment agenda. And no, I don't think you care about healthy debate. Censorship is never the answer.

Never got a response back.

But this was post not removed: 

https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/rwsjc7/ryan_grim_trans_rights_memo_warns_movement_badly

So you see YouTube videos are allowed, so that is not the issue.

This sub advertises itself as a leftist/progressives sub intent on political revolution, but operates as if it's been manipulated/co-opted and or infiltrated by the dem establishment - who are pro censorship, security state, imperialism, anti-free press. A perfect example (after the sandersforpresident sub, not unlike politics, politicalhumor, and presidentialracememes) of how a leftist sub can be co-opted and turned into a establishment dem propaganda board that promotes VBNMW and toe the line sentiment, that censors information such as wrongthink/healthy debate (and ugly and inconvinient truths that go against the establishment narrative and dem leadership) in an effort to suppress and control discourse.

Of course this was removed:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/rx6vev/greenwald_gives_inside_story_of_coward_trumps

Mod/s there appear to hate Greenwald, Assange, Mate, Dore, BJG, Hedges etc and wouldn't you know, these are the exact people that are part of the 'Russian asset/pro-Assad' smear list pushed by trolls on Twitter, be they out the dem establishment, security state and or NATO. The same folks who are labeled as 'dirtbag left' 'dum dum left' 'dore knob left' talkes about in reference to 'horseshoe theory' 'alt-right pipeline' 'red-brown alliance' etc by folks like Alexander Reid Ross, Dave Weigel, Eliot Higgins, TYT, Sam Seder etc.

I think at least one mod there is compromised or maybe they are all just brainwashed by the propaganda and disinformation/smear campaign aimed to character assassinate these folks for their anti-establishment, anti-war/imperialism sentiment, for pushing back on Russiagate and the Syria narrative and for promoting FTW, holding leadership accountable. If it is just the latter, then why censor criticism of corporate centrists as 'misinformation?'

Mod locks and removes:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/s9d8tk/if_dems_want_to_be_taken_seriously_on_voting/

and writes:

&gt;Stop promoting a party. This is against community rules and you have been informed about this before. You can promote individual candidates but not parties.

This user promotes and protects the dem party then censors others (including myself) when we promote individual candidates. Most recently Marianne Williamson.
