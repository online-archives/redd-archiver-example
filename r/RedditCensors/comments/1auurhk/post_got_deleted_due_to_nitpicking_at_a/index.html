      <div class="md">It was a while ago selling an item. I posted it for sale and got deleted pretty quick.

I asked the mod why and the answer was "The item must be out of the box."

Now the rule itself, I totally understand,  The thing is the said item was clearly visible with nothing obstructing the view. 

It was simply sitting on a top of padded packaging in the box, NOTHING covering the view of the item and 

I had other pics that showed all sides of the item. It was a delicate item so I took pics of the item that

was in the box. I noted it to the mod and same answer.

Needless to say I said screw it and sold it on eBay.</div>
