Buddy, I don't believe you. I can see your comments, you're a dick to other people. Most subs have civility rules you aren't following. Further than that, reddit has rules against posts that complain about being banned in other subreddits. It's the Respect Your Neighbor rule.

You perceive me as a dick to other people when in reality I just share opinions on subjects and add my own brand of humor and on occasion call people fucking pussies.

That said you are walking around on Reddit calling people “racist” for no reason. Not very civil of you.

I just checked your comments and you also are a dick.

Weird it’s like being a dick is okay if you share leftists beliefs but if I share them as a conservative then is uncivil.</div>

Do you want to participate in communities, or do you want to be a dick? In some spaces, those things are mutually exclusive. Why should people tolerate your bullshit if you just want to be confrontational and rude?

>You perceive me as a dick to other people when in reality I just share opinions on subjects and add my own brand of humor and on occasion call people fucking pussies.

And if someone says you're being rude or asked to stop, do you? Otherwise, you're just being a dick - reddit or no reddit. You're a conservative, does personal accountability and appropriate conduct not interest you? If you're trying to say conservatives don't have much to add to the conversation aside from insults and odd humor, I agree.

>That said you are walking around on Reddit calling people “racist” for no reason. Not very civil of you.

Lol, ok then?

>I just checked your comments and you also are a dick.

The difference is, I'm not pretending I'm not. I'm not making rage posts about being banned.

>Weird it’s like being a dick is okay if you share leftists beliefs but if I share them as a conservative then is uncivil.

I think your bias is showing bro. I don't care 🤷🏼‍♂️ go jerk your little rage cock and whine about not being allowed to insult people on Internet forums. That's a great way to spend your time.</div>

    <div class="md">Buddy, Reddit is notoriously a leftist echo chamber with mods who enforce their beliefs on everybody else and ban any and all dissenting opinions.

I get it, you just hate people who don’t agree with you on everything. Which is fine. But going so far as to think they should be silenced is very fascist of you.

You’re the only one here who thinks I’m a dick. Spez is in fact a hypocritical pussy.

That doesn’t make me a dick. 

And frankly, I will be fine without Reddit. It’s a cesspool anyways and the only place your beliefs are widely accepted are here.

The internet should be completely unmoderated except for illegal actions. If you can’t take being called a pussy then I don’t think you are mature enough to be on the internet.

But then again, the majority of the population is weak men like you who need coddled too.</div>

    <div class="md">Banned for no reason? I thought you said it was because you rage against the Reddit machine with hard hitting statements like "spez is a pussy." Pick a lane.

Look, there isn't some big conspiracy working against you to preserve spez's good name or anything. What I think most likely happened was: you made an incredibly low effort comment, it was reported for being uncivil, the mods investigated by looking at your history, realised they don't want to listen to your shit, and banned you to avoid dealing with you. 

You're not being silenced, you're being a dick. The mods you have issues with are not required to platform you being a dick. It's really as simple as that. I imagine most of the bans you've posted and complained about have a similar story behind them.</div>

    <div class="md">Lol you would make a good fascist if you believe people should be silenced because “you don’t want to listen to their shit”.

You are a bigger pussy than spez in that case.

By the way, remember place 2023. They literally wrote “Fuck Spez” across the entire thing. Wonder if all those redditors were banned too?

Reddit mods are gigantic butthurt bitches and Reddit is a cesspool of censorship</div>
