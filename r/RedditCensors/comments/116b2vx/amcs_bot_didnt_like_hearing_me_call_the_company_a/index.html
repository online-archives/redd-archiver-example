&gt;I don’t think you understand what a monopoly is.

&gt;Cinemark

&gt;Harkins  
&gt;  
&gt;Need I go on?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I posted these remarks, which were removed from the subreddit so quickly that I wasn't even able to archive them, even though I attempted to do so immediately after posting ...

&amp;#x200B;

I had never even heard of "Harkins" or "Cinemark" until just now. In the case of Harkins, that's hardly a surprise, if one takes a look at where those theaters are located, at the moment.

[http://web.archive.org/web/20230219112818/https://www.harkins.com/theatres](http://web.archive.org/web/20230219112818/https://www.harkins.com/theatres)

All of them, every single one, is located either in Arizona, California, Colorado or Oklahoma. So, apparently your thought was that if I, as a movie goer in Chicago, was unhappy with the service I was getting from AMC (and I am), that I could just hop a jet and fly down to Phoenix or Tulsa for a movie?

Oops, better make that Oklahoma City or Phoenix, because Tulsa wasn't on the list. That's some fearsome competitor you've found there. Not even a single theater in that chain located anywhere in the entire Midwest. Or the Northeast. Or the Southeast. Or 46 out of the 50 states. Pacific Northwest? Nope. Hawaii, Alaska? Where's that?

As much as I might (however briefly) love the idea of being rich enough to be able to fly my private plane down to the desert southwest just to watch the new Avatar movie, I don't think that I can quite pull that off on a math tutor's wages, or that really very many other people could, either. Also, that if one could, one would probably be able to afford one's own private theater and would opt for that because really, as extravagant as that would be, it would be less expensive in the long run.

For all practical intents and purposes, Harkins is not functioning as a competitor in our market, because it won't draw even one of the local customers away from AMC, for practical reasons. That's just too insanely far for anybody to travel, just to watch a movie. Again, let's remember that the markets not served include such small, out of the way places as Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, Atlanta ... so let's get real. It's not really a national chain, and you know it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Cinemark does a little better. Let's take a look at where those are located, in the state of Illinois.

[https://archive.is/Z6GBJ](https://archive.is/Z6GBJ)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bourbonnais, IL
2. Deer Park, IL
3. Joliet, IL
4. North Aurora, IL
5. Melrose Park, IL
6. Woodridge, IL
7. West Dundee, IL

&amp;#x200B;

Bourbonnais is far enough out that I had to look it up. I had never heard of it, before. It's in Kankakee County, which means that it's one of those places where people live when they want to commute into the suburbs. It's in the suburbs, of the suburbs. As for the rest of these, they're far enough out that the shift in accent is noticeable. One isn't going to just take the El out to one of them, and one certainly isn't going to walk. To get out to a theater there, at best, would involve a long, slow trip on a commuter line if one is even available, and for some of these towns, none are. There are trains to Joliet, not surprisingly, as it is a city of over 100,000, and to Melrose Park, even to Bourbonnais ($9 on Amtrak) but there are none going to Deer Park, North Aurora, Woodridge or West Dundee. If you want to get to any of these towns without a car, you're going to have to wait for a PACE bus that might or might not show up, depending on the mood that the driver is in that day, and pray that the return ride will show up, because otherwise, you'll be walking for a few miles through a Midwestern winter, hoping to get to the train station before the last train of the night leaves, going back downtown.

Since the movie theaters never seem to be located downtown and these towns sprawl, even once one gets to one of them, one will probably still be in the need of one of those PACE buses that might or might not be there.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All of this, just to get to the theater, just to get to the front door. It's a lot to go through, just to watch a movie. Did I mention that Metra has been known to set its doors to automatically lock, trapping commuters inside its stations, before? You seem to be living in a mental world in which everything is routine and reliable and commutes are always of reasonable length, and sorry, buddy, but in real life, that's not the world we're living in.

In practice, when AMC theaters started adopting the current moronic policy of refusing cash because of a "national coin shortage" that none of the local grocery stores seem to currently be aware of, one that hasn't been a real problem for quite some time, the lower income people who were kept from attending shows didn't generally end up taking their business to other chains, because those chains either chose to built in war zones like Englewood, or in remote places that we'd have to spend a few hours commuting to. This is not an exaggeration. Leaving a suburb that wasn't directly served by the commuter lines at 11:30 pm, I used to find myself coming back home at around 5 am. This is not a trip that many people would keep repeating.

Get away from the major cities, and public transit is that bad.

No, the end effect of the refusal of AMC theaters to take cash has been to exclude the poor and the lower middle class from being able to watch movies, at all, unless one counts watching them online. If one has to travel five hours, one way, in order to watch a movie that maybe will run for two hours, or risk death from multiple gun shot wounds in order to do so, it's just not worth it. As for flying to Los Angeles (or wherever) to watch a movie ... let's be serious ... that's the sort of argument that nobody would attempt anywhere outside of the Internet, because unless you have an echo chamber full of likeminded people to back you up, you know you'd get laughed out of the room with that one.

Yes, in practical terms, it's a monopoly. When you pretend it's not because, in theory, one could do business with its competitors if one were willing to travel far enough or risk death to do so, that's absurd. The kindest interpretation of your actions that the fact will allow is that you just didn't do your homework, that you posted a list of half-baked ideas as if they were sensible suggestions, and didn't bother to ask yourself how practical these ideas would be.

If you think that the trips I just described sounded bad, just picture the experience of somebody who would need to travel between suburbs, who would have to go downtown, and then take the train back out, because the movie he wanted to watch was being seen in a theater near another commuter line. The travel time gets doubled. An hour here and an hour there, and it adds up.

&amp;#x200B;

As you strike me as being the sort of bougie person who worships free markets and has quotes from Rush Limbaugh tattooed in places few will ever have to see, I imagine that this is the point at which you'll say that we could all get cars, including those of us who have disabilities that keep us out of the driver's seat, or who live in neighborhoods in which a parking spot costs almost as much as an apartment in other places, or on whose income a car would be impractical. Which, given that we're on the same site that pushed for the policies that helped send 60% of the businesses in my state into bankruptcy and imploded the job market in a way that will have an impact for decades to come, would be kind of trippy and more than a little bit cheeky. But above all else, it would be insane.

Seriously, one is supposed to ... what ... buy a car, putting down tens of thousands of dollars, moving out of one's apartment to a place where parking is cheaper, just to go to the movies? Experience tells me that's what you're going to say, next, as you try to salvage your position, and I have to ask just how far fetched an alternative has to be, before the apologists for corporate fertilizer are willing to admit that to even post such nonsense is to be a troll.

No offense, but please grow up and pull your head out of your donkey. AMC is a monopoly under any rational definition of that word, and it has been an arrogant one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**comment ends**

Ah, yes, the horrible "incivility" of suggesting that somebody check his privilege. Or something like that. This just happened, so we'll see what the sub has to say for itself, if anything.

Fun fact about this account: I created it in order to deal with an earlier act of censorship on yet another sub. There's a pattern emerging here, and it's the reason why I don't spend much time on Reddit. A lot of these removals seem to be little more than power flexes on the part of mods who have, at least once, turned out to still be in seventh grade.

Not sure how Reddit can handle that problem, but it really needs to do so in a hurry, unless it wants its site to turn into a virtual homeroom for emotionally disturbed tweens. Reasonable, responsible adults, also known as the people who produce content worth reading, aren't going to put up with this because we don't have to put up with this. We have other places to be.

Maybe we should be there? If Reddit became known as an after school hangout for people too young for Clearasil, would the heavily censored political discussions on it go on having an impact on governmental policy? Something to think about, at crazy moments like this one.</div>

    <div class="md">Pretty much every single industry only has 1-5 companies actually producing a product. They might own several companies that provide the same service each such as Volkswagen owning Bentley, Bugatti, Audi, Lamborghini etc... At the end of the day we didn't defeat the monopolies during Roosevelt's presidency, we changed laws and legalized them. Now they own everything, including the lobbies that direct our government. Including the media companies that we get our information from.

    <div class="md">The anticipated bad faith response from a volunteer corporate shill - what would social media be without comments like this one?

If the customer, as a practical matter, can not spent his money at a competing firm, then the business he is left with as his only alternative is, by definition, a monopoly. This is not an opinion, this is not a personal perspective, it's simply what the word means. A simple, awkward and undebatable fact that NS tries to distract us from by tossing word salad.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's a bit different to what is typical of a monopoly where their market position is usually marked by massive financial benefits and power.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look into that, shall we?

[https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/#:\~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20revenue%20of,before%20the%20COVID%2D19%20outbreak](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20the%20revenue%20of,before%20the%20COVID%2D19%20outbreak).

Annual revenues, $2.53 billion, and they're going up from a "mere" $1.24 billion, last year. How massive do financial benefits have to be? That's not part of the definition of a monopoly, anyway, but even if it were - 2.53 billion is chicken feed? Give me a break, and let's get back on the subject.

What NS is trying to do is create a confusion in the mind of the reader between an anti-competitive trust and a monopoly by acting so confidently that the more suggestible readers won't let themselves notice that he has posted absolute nonsense.</div>
