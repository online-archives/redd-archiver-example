      <div class="md">Nigger  is a word. Like all words, it's meaning and significance depends on  context. If you slur somebody as being a nigger, you are engaging in  racial harassment. If you use nigger as I am currently using it,  referring to a word, you are not engaging in racial harassment. In the  same vein, it's entirely possible to engage in racial hatred without  using any taboo words at all. The idea that a word itself, without  context, can be beyond the pale is ludicrous.

The  issue seems to me to really be one about tribal identification. The  rule of not saying nigger in any context (or atleast, if you're not  black) is ultimately arbitrary, but it can become a touchstone issue for  us to claim an identity. The fault line goes like this; any use of the  word nigger is racist, prohibition on its use is anti-racist. This has no relation to the actual content of what is being said, as outlined  above, it is simply a rule imposed on us that is demanded to be true on  the cyclical basis that it is demanded to be true. A shocking example I  found of this lately was a US friend who was willing to determine Jimmy  Carr (UK comedian) speaking positively about the actual genocide of  gypsys during the Holocaust is okay because it's a joke, but a comedian  who used the word nigger in a joke would be unacceptable. The issue,  quite aside from actual racism or hatred (which undoubtedly has a link,  but not a necessary one), is an arbitrary prohibition on the word  itself.

The strange demand that  nigger never be said or communicated is just another example of US  cultural imperialism and ironically, in itself, somewhat racist. This is  not Black Americans in particular inflicting cultural imperialism on  the rest of the world, though they are certainly part of the wider  ignorant US cultural forces.

I took a 3 day suspension, for engaging in discussion about the word nigger, for 'promoting hatred'. I have not received an apology,  and so anticipate this post being reported for an eventual ban. Please report this.  Occasional posts exploring this issue will now be the only posts I make  on reddit until I am perma-banned, in protest at the cowardice of  arbitrary and indefensible judgements.

After perma-ban, I'll spend some time reporting every (unproblematic) mention of the word nigger as hatred, to shed light on the utter hypocrisy and baseless argument that it is. I shall not make another account, not for some time at least.

Anybody  can say nigger. Nobody can engage in racist harassment. Reject nonsense cultural hysteria from the USA, and its child-like philosophical  engagement from much of its dumbed-down population. You can say nigger.</div>

I'm happy to see differing approaches and responses to OP. 

We are adults and mature enough to discuss subjects like this. So have at it.

    <div class="md">I grew up in the 21st century. Using that word is never acceptable and could get you in trouble everywhere, even though I had a few friends who joked around with that word. However, both teachers and parents would use that word in examples. While my mom read Tom Sawyer to me, she used that word. My history teacher used that word in describing stories of slavery. It was never banned to simply use it like that.</div>

    <div class="md">I completely agree with your point. Although I could entirely see someone else's idea of the word being a trigger or just blatantly offensive. 

It's a powerful word. Years of hatred backing it coming from a highly oppressive time period could very well make a word just disgusting to hear. And it is, you'll probably notice I won't say it. But then, even from African Americans the usage doesn't make any sense.

I'm not justifying your ban, I'm just saying that to some the word just immediately sets fire to your brain and you go beyond logical and linear thought processing.</div>

    <div class="md">The needs to be offended reddit "liberal" crowd would be really surprised to know how many people in the Latin community use that word on the regular and use it within the right and appropriate context around their own kind, and around the black community. It is also used by white people, and especially white kids who use it in the same actually appropriate context. These are my... that's my....you are my....these ... are wild for this one!!! etc. 

There is context for every word that makes it okay to be used. Context is key, but that goes overlooked when people want to be offended. 

I am surprised that the word still has the power that some people want it to have. You'd think by now the word would have lost all its negative meaning, but the race-peddlers need it to be something still.</div>
