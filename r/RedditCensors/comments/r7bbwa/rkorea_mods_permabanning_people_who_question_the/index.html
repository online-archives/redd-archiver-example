      <div class="md">For context, /r/korea and most such forums across the english speaking internet tend to be mostly populated and moderated by foreigners, the majority of whom are there to work as temporary native english teachers (a relatively low paid temporary job).  Most people of ethnic korean origin there will be korean-americans, as a rule koreans have very little presence in the english internet. As such, despite the name the prevailing opinion and moderation tends to be that of non-koreans. It's also unfortunate that many of the louder voices within many places such as facebook tends to be quite derogatory towards koreans.

Also for context, I've had some bad run ins with this particular group's arbitrary modding, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReportTheBadModerator/comments/hw5sa1/unknown_from_rkorea_tacitly_approve_of_posts/). Essentially someone was justifying killing koreans pre-liberation on behalf of the japanese for because he claimed they were communist and I pointed out that this was not only historically incorrect, it was justifying murder. Unfortunately this is not a lone example of the type of arbitrary modding taking place there, though murder of koreans isn't often justified if I'm being fair.

Today I was involved in a discussion regarding mandatory testing that was required of foreigners. The context is that there were signs of an outbreak among the illegal foreign factory workers (i.e. not the english teachers) who unfortunately weren't willingly coming forward to be tested. This despite testing being free and the government saying that any information that comes out because of testing won't be held against people illegally in the country. Because of the risk of an outbreak and the lack of voluntary testing in the affected communities a blanket PCR test (one test, one time only) was required of all foreigners (i.e. including the english teachers) in order to ensure that any outbreak was caught before it could spread further.

It's become a common within circles dominated by such expats proclaim that it's "xenophobic" and "racist" despite the fact that it was necessary and that koreans would be subjected to the same were they similarly reticent in coming forward for testing. Comment chain [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/r6dvru/first_case_of_omicron_variant_in_korea/hmx277p/).

For context this type of derogatory attitude amongst expats is common in other places such as [spain](https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2020/07/11/typical-spanish-why-british-expats-in-spain-need-to-stop-using-this-derogatory-phrase/). It's understandable to some degree because everybody moving out of their comfort zone experiences discomforts that add up, but it's not justifiable or excusable if you're then going to turn around and claim to be discrminated against over a PRC test.

The response was to simply repeat that it was xenophobic despite not being to justify *why* it was xenophobic, beyond that it involved foreigners and ignoring the context on which it happened. More reasonable people [agreed](https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/r6dvru/first_case_of_omicron_variant_in_korea/hmxp8y6/), ultimately it wasn't perfectly implemented but it was justified by the circumstances and not just some "xenophobic" persecution of expats.

The discussion continued onwards, with disagreement to be fair, when I was suddenly permabanned with the reason listed as "No overly inflammatory, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic or offensive language." But nothing actually clarifying what broke that rule and when I responded with:

&gt; I'm sorry? How is anything that I posted "inflammatory, sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or offensive language"?

the response was a mute for 28 days. Difficult to interpret that as anything other than a tacit acknowledgement that there is no valid justification for the permaban.

Unfortunately it seems that disagreeing with the echo chamber is not acceptable. These are of course the people who claim that "Topics are generally free for discussion" as an excuse for removing posts disagreeing with justifying the muder of independence fighters. This type of permaban and muting to avoid explaining seems to have become more and more common recently on that sub-reddit. I'll try and get other people who have experienced the same to post their own experiences here.

If the forum was named /r/expat_korea or something similar that made its bias obvious then there would be no grounds for complaint or expectations of fair modding.</div>

    <div class="md">That is true, and that's why I don't expect them to change. 

But they pretend to be something that they're not. If they were open about being the second coming of Dave's ESL cafe or the bitter expat facebook groups then at least people would know to expect that they'd be fine with people advocating murder as long as it was against koreans.</div>
