I'll admit that your post does come off as somewhat trolling and very r/news flavoured.

This is my own opinion and I guess that the mods there looked at it exactly the same. </div>

    <div class="md">How does that come off “trolling” at all? It’s on topic and relevant. to the comment I was replying to. That is not trolling in anyway shape or form.

Either way, that is a violation of their own rules with dealing with situations like this:

&gt;Rule 10: Multiple rules violations within 2 months

&gt;Current policy on violations of rules : 1st and 2nd violation - deletion of the post; 3rd violation - 1 day ban; 4th violation - 1 week ban; 5th violation - 1 month ban; 6th violation - permanent ban. Rule violations will expire after 2 months(except a permaban).


Having an opinion that is respectful doesn’t warrant banning someone. </div>

    <div class="md">I'm not the one that banned you mate, nor would I have 'censored' your comment. 

The main issue I would have with a comment like that here is that you aren't adding to the discussion, you're spouting something that you believe is fact when you can't back it up. 

Political or whatever subject you're trying to discuss, you need something open ended for a discussion. 

Like I said, I'm not here defending anyone, I'm giving you *my* opinion on the matter. </div>

    <div class="md">I’m not accusing you of being the one who banned me, mate. I’m saying that my topic didn’t warrant a ban in anyway shape or form, according to both common sense and the rules established by the moderators. I’m just responding to your opinion.

&gt;My main problem with the comment is you aren’t adding anything to the conversation.

1: that’s inaccurate because I was responding to a previous comment which you can see in the Reddit link which was about trump and Putin.

2:my opinion added about as much to that conversation as yours to this one. No one’s banning you, are they?

Anyway, happy holidays and have a good one.</div>

    <div class="md">see, this I like, discussion. 

I agree that you should not have been banned or the comment deleted, not arguing that, but adding a little more meat would have gotten the discussion you were after. 

Do you honestly think they like each other? (not arguing, genuinely asking). 

From what I can see Putin and Trump aren't even remotely in the same league, Putin is way more intelligent and aware of his surroundings. </div>

    <div class="md">Of course they like each other. I’m guessing you aren’t in the states/haven’t seen the whole Russian collusion situation. Trump’s lawyer just pleaded guilty and is about to bring the house down on the situation. https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/a1hr67/former_trump_lawyer_and_fixer_michael_cohen/?st=JP3B1XHU&amp;sh=f8503cd3



Also, did you see trump’s face when he saw Putin in Paris compared to everyone else? https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/9w3a4m/trump_merkel_and_macron_have_different_reactions/?st=JP3B386S&amp;sh=74af6be5


Lastly, read this breaking story from the past hour about trump giving Putin a 50 million dollar penthouse. https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a1mfip/the_trump_organization_planned_to_give_vladimir/?st=JP3B3RPO&amp;sh=f9a91789

They may be in different leagues, but having trump in the whitehouse benefits the Kremlin. But he won’t be much longer;)</div>
