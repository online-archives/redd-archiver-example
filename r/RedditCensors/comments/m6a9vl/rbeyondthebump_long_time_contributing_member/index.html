I've observed a fairly disturbing phenomenon on the major parenting subs - they've turned pregnancy and childbearing into an activity that is all about them *(the parents, particularly the mother)*. And the health, development, etc. of the child is irrelevant. It's like they're treating human beings as toys or pets, and anyone who comes close to pointing this out gets attacked and silenced. These kids have no one to defend/represent their needs, and the parents &amp; mods in those subs make sure of it.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't see any problem with /r/childfree. It's great that people who don't want children are choosing not to create them. 

What's problematic is people irresponsibly creating children when they lack the ability/desire to care for them properly and ensure they're healthy and well developed.</div>
