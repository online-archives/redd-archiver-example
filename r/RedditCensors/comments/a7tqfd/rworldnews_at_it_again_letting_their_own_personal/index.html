      <div class="md">Seeing the story on the incredibly discriminatory Swedish music festival, I posted to article on /r/worldnews. Here is the post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a7fbxt/swedens\_manfree\_feminist\_music\_festival\_is\_found/](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a7fbxt/swedens_manfree_feminist_music_festival_is_found/)

&amp;#x200B;

I was happy to see it had a good amount of activity, and after only 20 minutes it was at 28 net upvotes. Then it was just suddenly gone. I sent the following message to the mods of /r/worldnews:

&amp;#x200B;

"Good afternoon,

I posted an article and was happy to see it trending up with 28 net upvotes in 20 minutes. Then I noticed it was suddenly not on the subreddit anymore when searching by New. Nothing was noted on the post saying it was removed, but it's just suddenly not there. Could you please explain? Thank you.

The post...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a7fbxt/swedens\_manfree\_feminist\_music\_festival\_is\_found/](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a7fbxt/swedens_manfree_feminist_music_festival_is_found/)"

&amp;#x200B;

After my initial message, I did get an actual reason put on my post. Confused, I messaged the mods again:

&amp;#x200B;

"There's now a reason on the post for its removal. The reason is "misleading title." The title states "Sweden's 'man-free' feminist music festival is found guilty of discrimination by authorities." In the article, in the second sentence, it backs that statement up by saying: "But describing the festival as 'male-free' was a violation of anti-discrimination legislation, Sweden's Discrimination Ombudsman (DO) has ruled." How is the title misleading?"

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I messaged again with the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"Good morning,

I'm yet to receive a reply on the above questions. Please let me know. Thank you."

&amp;#x200B;

Just now, I once more messaged since I had not heard back still. In this message, I copy-pasted all my original conversation and specifically mentioned that I had yet to hear back. I received a reply immediately:

&amp;#x200B;

"As we have stated, do not contact us again."

&amp;#x200B;

I was then promptly muted for 72 hours. Here is an image of this entire exchange.

[http://magaimg.net/img/6w4n.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6w4n.png)

&amp;#x200B;

So...I can't get an explanation for my post being removed, no matter how outrageous the "reasoning." And if I message again in three days and ask them to do what they are bound to do by reddit modiquette, I'll more than likely receive yet another suspension. That would be my third. What a fucking wonderful website.

&amp;#x200B;

As a reminder, here is the official Reddit Moddiquette: [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/moddiquette)

&amp;#x200B;

Some highlights...

&amp;#x200B;

Please do:

Be calm and polite

Offer helpful rule explanations, tips, and links to new or confused users.

Try to respond to all of your moderator mail, even if you cannot address it in a timely manner.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't:

    <div class="md">That's a super pertinent question. I attempted to ask them, but they're going with the "put fingers in ears and say Lalalalala" approach.

Also, I was not banned. Just suspended for a week once already for asking questions. And now this time I've been muted. Who knows, maybe I'll get suspended again. Last time it was a day or two of nothing before the suspension, so there's still a chance! </div>

    <div class="md">I appreciate all your attempts, but remember the attempts are futile and only demonstrate the retardation of the reddit policy, it's the same with youtube, same with twitter. 

The option are too annoy, leave or not care. I prefer the first until I'm forced to do the second. 

But I'm not expecting any change to come from the pest that inhabit the mainstream reddits.</div>

    <div class="md">Check out what's on /r/WorldNews now with over a thousand upvotes:

Sweden: Women-only music festival falls foul of discrimination laws | A music festival billed as being “male-free” has been found guilty of discrimination by Sweden’s Discrimination Ombudsman (DO).

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a7y96n/sweden_womenonly_music_festival_falls_foul_of/

So it was a misleading title when I posted it, but not when someone else posted it???

I've commented on the post pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation:

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/a7y96n/slug/ec7a6ms

I'm predicting they remove my post, then when I ask why, if they even answer, they make up a rule. I'm gonna go with "no meta posts" as their made up rule. Let's see!

Edit: My comment has suspiciously been removed without any notification to me as to the fact that it was removed or the reason behind the removal. Wow...I'm so shocked...</div>
