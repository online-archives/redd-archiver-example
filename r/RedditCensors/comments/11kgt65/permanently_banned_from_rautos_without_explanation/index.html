Seeing as how it is sitting at 1, I wonder if it even showed up or was autoremoved i.e. removed immediately by automod.

I replied to the ban message with: 

&gt;What did I do to deserve a permanent ban? Is there a rule against posting pictures of cars? WTF 

And hour later a mod responds: 

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Autos/wiki/rules#wiki_self-promotion.2Fspam 

I replied: 

&gt;How is a single post considered spam? I shared it from another sub to this one. I don't claim to own the car or have taken the picture so I don't know how that would be considered self promotion either. So you're permabanning folks who try to share content they come across that they think is relevant to this sub? 

And:

&gt;And I have posted here before over the last 2+ years, at least 17 posts show up when I search. So I am curious why now I can't make these posts but could before? It wasn't spam or self promotion then, why is it considered that now? Can you see then why the ban seems unfair and out of left field? 

The mod wrote back: 

&gt;Sorry, pretty much all you do is link farm. We're not interested. Thank You. 

Then put me on mute.</div>

This reads like an actual description of your entire account.

Seems like the sub has standards and don’t want your substandard submissions bringing down the quality of the place. Considering it’s their space that is a completely reasonable position to take. 

Also, according to their rules they aren’t really big on people earning money from their sub. Considering you are rather likely to be a paid shill for Russian disinformation outlets, an argument could be made that you are also breaching this rule as well.

Seems like once again, and as always, you’re in the wrong but want to blame everyone else. Time to either grow up or get a better job.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;&gt;Link spam/karma farming is not welcome. If you’re sharing images/links across multiple subs at a time, you’re likely link spamming. 

I did not spam them. I posted a single picture and the same type and quality of content that I posted at that sub from 2+ years ago to 6 months ago (and content that the community seemed to like) but they didn't get removed and called spam and me accused of link spam/karma farming then, so why now? And spam is traditionally a link trying to sell you something isn't it (?) But these days it is  typically when someone posts the same link or comment many times in a thread, or spams the same post to numerous subs or posts numerous posts to a single sub in a short period of time. At any rate, I didn't post there expecting to get much karma, and I have had the same expectations elsewhere I post, I enjoy posting content I like that I come across to relevant subs. It's a hobby. If I wanted to 'karma farm' I would post to a sub that I would expect to get a lot of karma and just do this. There are users with 30-40+ million karma. Not sure why you have this prejudice against people with a lot of karma, I post a lot, so what. I've been posting a lot for years. There are people who are far better at collecting karma and I would say a number of those post specifically to farm karma, so it's kinda shit of you to put me into that box because I post a lot of content that resonates with me. 


&gt;This reads like an actual description of your entire account.

&gt;Seems like the sub has standards and don’t want your substandard submissions bringing down the quality of the place. Considering it’s their space that is a completely reasonable position to take. 

If you search on that sub you'll see a number of my posts there were upvoted by the community, so that doesn't really align with the narrative you are pushing here. Likewise I have posted good to great quality content elsewhere that receives upvotes but you ignore that also and called it substandard w/e. You just don't like me for whatever reason and are being dishonest, as usual.

&gt;Also, according to their rules they aren’t really big on people earning money from their sub. Considering you are rather likely to be a paid shill for Russian disinformation outlets, an argument could be made that you are also breaching this rule as well.

I don't earn money from posting. Nobody pays me to post and nice mccarthyism. I'm an American btw.

&gt;Seems like once again, and as always, you’re in the wrong but want to blame everyone else. Time to either grow up or get a better job.

Seems like once again, and as often you're in the wrong about me being in the wrong here and want to victim blame and gaslight folks into thinking they're the problem and they deserve being banned for posting content to relevant subs because you have a grudge against those folks due to their political and or foreign policy bias. And it's rich you telling me to grow up considering you hold this grudge and basically follow me around to shit talk me and downplay or outright deny overmoderation and mod abuse because  it's directed at someone you don't like.</div>
