    <div class="md">Do you really want to give employees at Reddit, few of whom ever identify themselves, a mandate to start exercising more power than they have in the past? If power gets abused when concentrated in the hands of the mods we have, how will it be abused less when more of it is concentrated in fewer hands? Reddit is not a large company.

You'll probably say something like "employees can be fired," but I've seen people in Support, Safety and Trust, etc. do some wild and outrageous things, and not once have I ever heard of one of them getting fired over the way he treated a user.

My suggestion is "create a new subreddit." Also, suggest that Reddit put a reasonable cap on the number of subreddits that a user is allowed to moderate. Set it absurdly high - let's say 50 - a number that won't really be a problem for almost any of us, but might put some limits on the ambitions of some of the "power mods" out there. Then say that any sub with more than a thousand members counts as 5 subs toward that total, unless it had fewer when one first became a mod of it, grandfathering people in so that mods won't be punished for helping to build up successful communities from nothing. Maybe those with over 10,000 members can count as 10 subs, and those with over 100,000 as 20, with that same principle of grandfathering in place - one pays against that total allotment of points one has to taking on mod duties based on the size of the group when one first becomes a mod.

Instead of going for "answerability," limit the power that any one person has to abuse.</div>

That's completely untrue. First, there are only six responses to the comment, and second, zero of them are negative. Four are unanswered questions, but they're relatively low-impact and tangential ones, such as "What part of the body stores this information?"</div>
