    <div class="md">This is the worst I've seen in a while. Check out this gem that, as of this comment, is at 256 points:

&gt;WayoftheBern is an alt-right Trump supporting sub that started out pretending to be a group of liberals, but after a while they couldn't maintain the pretense.  

&gt;It's a great example of the lack of ethics in the alt-right.  They pretend to be their opponents in order to make them look as bad as Trump supporters. 

Ah, yes. It's completely unbiased to say the entire alt right is devoid of ethics. And it's completely unbiased to say Trump supporters look bad. And it's completely unbiased to say that an entire subreddit is all alt right.

Remember everyone: Rules for thee but not for me.

Edit:

I've messaged the mods with the following to try and get an understanding of how the comment did not violate their rules. If they were just enforcing already-posted rules, that's fine. But if they were removing some things for rule violations but simply allowing other stuff to remain, then that's censorship. Below is my message to the mods. I will update if I hear back.

&gt;Good afternoon,

&gt;This top level comment seemed in clear violation of rule 4 of your subreddit, yet it remained. In the sprit of ensuring I comply with rule 4, could you clear up my confusion?

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/9occ9q/whats_up_with_rsandersforpresident_and/e7t5r0c/

&gt;How is it unbiased to call an entire subreddit "alt right"? How is it unbiased to say the subreddit was trying to maintain some pretense? How is it unbiased to say the alt right has a lack of ethics? And finally, how is it unbiased to say Trump supporters look bad?

&gt;Please let me know. Thank you.

Edit2: the reply...

&gt;How is it unbiased to call an entire subreddit "alt right"?

"alt right" is the name of an actual group. Like saying an entire subreddit is left wing, or saying an entire subreddit is chess players or Kiwanis. If they're not alt-right, then the user is just wrong, not biased. It's possible to be wrong without being biased.

&gt;How is it unbiased to say the subreddit was trying to maintain some pretense? How is it unbiased to say the alt right has a lack of ethics?

Pretty much the same answer. It's possible to be wrong without being biased.

&gt;And finally, how is it unbiased to say Trump supporters look bad?

Well, they can't all be home runs, I guess.</div>
