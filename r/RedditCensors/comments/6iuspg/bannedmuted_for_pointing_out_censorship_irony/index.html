    <div class="md">I feel like the immense number of bans and muting is trying to train users to self sensor. 

But don't do it. Idk who said this quote I have it written on a card and hung up. I believe part of it is from the book," FUCK" Word Taboo and the First Amendment 

#words have power! 

Words control thought, thoughts control feelings. Allowing yourself to be censored literally allows yourself to be controlled! </div>

    <div class="md">New social media literally creates a bubble of isolation and self flagellation. Facebook has algorithms to make people see suggestions of what the site thinks they already like based on past likes. Reddit is all circlejerks of agreement and those who don't are often downvoted below the viewing threshold, banned, etc. Younger people who grew up with that as the normal I feel are going to be less tolerant and just go apeshit when they see outside views, which explains alot of Reddit behavior. </div>

    <div class="md">Speaking of recently I wrote this to a thread I created:  

&gt;Wow, talk about censorship.    
&gt;75 comments posted to this story thread, and 59 were removed! See:

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/6fm16w/california_passes_bill_banning_investment_in/dijz2lk/

You can see the actual thread here without deletions:    

&gt;https://www.ceddit.com/r/California/comments/6fm16w/california_passes_bill_banning_investment_in/

The funny thing is when I pointed out the massive censorship pathetic nerd marks of Reddit, thanked the moderator for his hard work! No wonder why Redditors have such a horrible reputation on the non-Reddit internet... Actually Redditors don't even have a good image on the Reddit internet, as illustrated by this /r/announcements thread to discuss the abandoning of the defaults and the following very highly voted comments:      

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6eh6ga/reddits_new_signup_experience/dia9w49/     
&gt;Too late for that[to improve the quality of some of the defaults], I'd think. They already have millions of morons subscribed to them.

The next highest voted nested reply dished out even more:    
&gt;Right. New subs will have to accumulate millions of morons organically. Old defaults won't lose their preloaded morons, but may slowly start to recover as the existing morons lose their passwords, fall down stairs, forget to breathe, etc.

    <div class="md">What's mind boggling to me, is that seemed like a very respectful discussion. 

So simply the topic caused deleting? I don't bother worrying about comments that don't make sense. I simply assume the mod got another mod or a friend to comment. </div>
