https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagramreality/comments/emg264/i_thought_this_was_a_digital_drawing/

I am posting my comment because a moderator there told me I was banned for.. attempting to delete my comments. (which I never did, in fact, I see them?) 

I said this:
"What happens whenever everyone stops following these mentally unstable people? When these people have no social followers any longer, what do they go back to? This thing, anyone who yall post (especially repeat offenders), etc.. what happens to them if they wake up tomorrow and nobody cares any longer?"

Someone said:

"This is drag makeup, not mental instability."

My reply:

"I meant these IG people who post over the top nonsense-edited pics as a whole - regardless of their personal whatever.

This person being a crossdresser doesnt absolve them of abusing filters and being a target the same as everyone else on this sub. If you purposely edit and filter your pics to the point where you are unrecognizable, and bend reality to change who you are as a human, you aren't right upstairs."

FYI.. whomever posted the original pic said "I thought this was a digital drawing". 

Another reply:
"A few points for you: 1. Crossdresser is a slur 2. Drag is a performance based on fantasy. Would you consider actors in elaborate costumes crazy? How about Geishas, Kabuki dancers, etc? 3. In general, it’s really not appropriate or fair to diagnose anyone who is not your patient with a mental illness. Including those “nonsense IG people.”"

My final reply before being banned:
&gt; Crossdresser is a slur

No it isnt. Stop trying to be offended.

And my point was made irrespective of someone dressing up in goofy costumes. It's about people who overly edit pictures for likes, for approval, to lie to people for their acceptance. They are lying to themselves and their followers. There is something mentally unstable about that entire action'

But the overall takeaway was not that I was banned for saying something they didnt like, which was never said.. it was instead:

**"you literally deleted both comments?? like what lmao'**

I never deleted anything, but that makes me ask the question:

I see them, I never deleted them, and yet someone else cannot see them now because.. well, how did that happen? 

WTF is going on there? Did another moderator delete my comments and ban me? **I can even see the posts from a different machine that isnt logged into reddit and never has been**</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;a caricature of femininity

No. My wife is six foot tall. She does burlesque and belly dance. She is not a thin woman. Her stage costumes are very close to what drag queens put on and if she has to travel in costume or at some events that have a drag performance aspect she gets confused as a drag queen. **If** drag is a caricature of femininity then it's because that's what women in show business want us to see, fabulous outrageous costumes, fabulous outrageous make-up and hair. Anybody can put a dress on a man, but can that man have a larger than life personality? Drag isn't about the man in a dress. It's about the person on stage looking their best, showing their art, and simultaneously being bold, beautiful, and vulnerable.

**Simultaneously being bold, beautiful, and vulnerable.** This is what my wife thinks feminine performance art is. If it happens to be a man, dress or no, then it's feminine art.</div>

    <div class="md">The difference is, your wife is a woman, she can express and interpret her femininity anyway she wants to. Men in drag are obviously not women, they're not celebrating us, they're usually displaying exaggerated, overtly sexual male ideas of what a woman is, stereyotypes, because a man cannot truly be us, he can only be a cheap imitation. In the same way many black people don't like white people dressing up and pretending to be black, many women feel similar about drag.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;many women feel similar about drag.

That's fine. Feel the way you want.

&gt;overtly sexual male ideas of what a woman is

You know that overwhelmingly drag artists are gay. They put on their shows for mostly gay audiences. 

&gt;stereyotypes

I'm not sure you're aware that a drag performance has become a stereotype for gay men. Not the dressing up in women's clothes part, but the flamboyant, sassy, outrageous, in your face part of gay. I'm 99% sure that performance artists like Billy Eichner (doesn't do drag) is not the loud sass mouth in his day to day life. He's putting on a stereotype, not of women but of gay men, and if you imagine him in a dress there would be no difference between his typical performance and that of Drag. 

Please don't confuse crossdressing with the performance art that is drag. No one in drag is trying to fool anyone. I enjoy drag performance mostly because offensive lines in the sand like you've drawn are erased. 

Women now do drag (aside from drag kings. Shout out to my favorite (Landon Cider)[https://www.landoncider.com/]). Watching a normal woman stand up comedian I place bets on how fast she makes a vagina joke. In male comedy dick and fart jokes are a low bar. Yes it still gets laughs, and women are welcome to the low brow comedy. A woman who puts on the high hair, and fashion nightmare, and gets on stage to do an act that (occasionally still does a vagina joke) does comedy or sings covers while adding sassy comments about the lyrical meanings is a funnier woman to me. Is she putting on gay male face? Yes! It's even funnier! It's full circle, politically opening the dialogue with comedy.

Drag to me (admittedly not even all drag performers agree) is about exposing vulnerability; exploring, exploiting, and finally nurturing the vulnerability. If drag is a stereotype of women it's because it's a stereotype of my mom. Statistically moms are women. I'm a straight guy, I've done performance art (not drag). My wife performs. From experience I know there's a ton of work that goes into it and I personally feel that it shouldn't be dismissed on the face of what you see. Let me encouraged you to open the book, read a few chapters, &amp; watch some really bad acts. Hopefully you'll discover they're so bad they're good. 

Finally if I could direct you attention to the late Robin Williams. His comedy is known for being all over the charts but as a male comedian he constantly displayed his vulnerability. That vulnerability is what made his dick and fart jokes acceptable, dare I say gold. If you don't enjoy men displaying vulnerability (stereotype of femininity) then that's fine. If you don't like when men pretend to be women I suspect you probably don't like magicians. You've got to accept that you're being fooled to enjoy it. Drag as it exists isn't there to slight women as the blackface minstrel was.</div>

    <div class="md">I was told I was banned for using the term "crossdresser" because it's a slur.

However, this is a very popular sub: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/crossdressing/

people who ski, are skiers, people who swim are swimmers, i call a person who crossdresses as a crossdresser, and it's a slur? It really isnt, it's what they are? This is bizarre to me.</div>
