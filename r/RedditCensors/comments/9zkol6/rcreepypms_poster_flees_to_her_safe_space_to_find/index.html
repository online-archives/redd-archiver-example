    <div class="md">Definitely some comments that should have been deleted, but *many* more that are people saying "I don't 100% agree with OP but I definitely don't think OP should have received such a message." Nope. Either you're 100% on board or you're censored.

I guess medical fact must be removed?

&gt;Its perfectly fine to believe what you want. You believe a clinical mental illness is not an issue an removing parts helps fix it. An I disagree so guess what learn to agree to disagree.

How does this get removed?

&gt;I disagree with the nature of the transgender movement heavily but this guy has no fucking reason to be such an fucking jerk. We lose everything if we abandon our own decency and common respect to people, including those we disagree with. I presume this guy who messaged you was probably Christian, but he would do well to remember the words "Love thine enemy" and "Treat thy neighbors as thyself." Compassion is the greatest weapon one can use to make someone see from your point of view, not mindless rage and bullying.

Again, same here. You either are on board all the way or you get silenced.

&gt;i dont care if i will get downvoted because of my opinion but he got some points. they way he tells it is disrespectful but i struggle to find a single thing to argue about...

This person is rather level headed, but, alas, censored.

&gt;Only Men or Female in this world. You can change your outside as much as you want, can't change your DNA. It is a mental illness. Its your life you do what you want, just stop trying to shove it down our throats to accept that type of illness as normal. I don't agree with the person telling you to end your life over it. 

This got censored away too:

&gt;Now while I’m a bit iffy on the whole “Trans” movement myself, telling someone whose GENUINELY trying to transition to kill themselves is a tad (about thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis much) fucked

Definitely more on that thread. Check out the link.
