Correction, they just temporarily muted me. Imagine being the mods of a military subreddit and you make sure no-one disagrees with what the White House and CNN are saying, to the point where you ignore what is objectively true. How embarrassing.</div>

    <div class="md">Any time you support a large group in any form in any context, you're going to be accidentally supporting *some* terrible people. If this is enough to deter you from helping, then you're kind of a piece of shit.

We're not "supporting nazis" in Ukraine. We're supporting the huge majority of average citizens and innocent civilians. There are millions of people. Of fucking course we're accidentally supporting some nazis.

There are people here in the US who are vehemently opposed to social welfare who are *on* social welfare. They think their own circumstances are justified and legitimate, but welfare is worthless because everyone else is certainly abusing it. It doesn't cross their mind how many other cases are absolutely also justified and legitimate.

Yes, it bothers me that people would abuse it. No, I don't think we should kill welfare just because someone people are gonna abuse it. There will always be people abusing every system and there will always be shitty people in every group. It takes some extraordinarily small-picture thinking to think a good deed shouldn't be done just because some small evil comes from it.

You shouldn't've been banned, but your argument is actually the dumbest shit and can be applied in literally any context, making it worthless.</div>

"It's OK to arm neo-Nazis because anytime you support a large group in any form in any context, you're going to be ~~accidentally~~ supporting some terrible people!"

Except they aren't "accidentally" arming them. They knew exactly who they were in 2014, they know who they are now. Nice effort though. 👍

    <div class="md">Governments like the US and Canada are involved so politicians and the wealthy elite can gain financially from the purchase of arms and equipment on the tax payer's dollar. It's no different than the last two decades they've spent in the middle east. Not to mention the US government needing to support their installed puppet Zelensky. Opposing this doesn't mean supporting Russia but you'll have a hard time convincing the masses who think they accomplish anything changing their profile picture to support *thing in the news* on the regular.</div>
