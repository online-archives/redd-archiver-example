    <div class="md">I post stuff I come across and like, to what I think are appropriate subs. As you can see, I am also passionate about politics. No, I am not a shill and this is not a karma farming account, I just enjoy collecting karma. Perma banning someone over the above and when the users has made it clear they didn't intentionally violate any rules, is extreme. Yes, I think they wronged me or else I wouldn't have bothered posting this here. We can agree to disagree though.</div>

    <div class="md">Yup, I'll agree to disagree. You flood reddit with posts as if you're starved for attention. Then you get defensive when mods get tired of seeing your posts in their sub.

    <div class="md">Right, but what *does* matter to you is commenting on WTF to tell people their content doesn't belong and you probably also report these people. Notice some of those posts stay up, so I guess mods don't always agree with you. What you do is more sad than people who enjoy collecting karma.

I *also* have a life outside of Reddit and if you look me up on Redditmetis you will see my account activity is not bot-like and also there are accounts with 10/20/30 million post karma. It is not terribly hard to collect karma and Reddit even encourages users to show off their karma, though notice how I don't do that because I use old reddit. If I cared as much as you think I do about karma, I would have pinned my best posts by now to show them off, don't you think?</div>

How am I narcissistic? Look at how you are talking to me in this thread? I am only defending myself against your accusations. I think I probably hit the nail on the head and also you are likely projecting here and being narcissistic yourself when you comment on people's posts over at WTF, spamming the same "your post doesn't meet my standards of WTF" even if mods disagree with you.</div>

I suspect Karmagheden is a Jimmy Dore alt account, given his constant promotion of his channel, check out the investigation Matt Binder did in exposing his sockpuppet on Twitter</div>

    <div class="md">And surprisingly enough, I don't have a lot of stuff removed and that I don't know about. Mostly the stuff that is removed is from presidentialracememes or politicalhumor (which I addressed here when I was banned from them) or maybe political_revolution or democraticsocialism (when it is of stuff too critical of corporate center/military industrial complex/security state, from independent media outlets/journalists*). I've had some stuff removed from nextfuckinglevel and a few other subs, but they have not given me warnings or temp/permabanned me.</div>
