    <div class="md">I was banned after I messaged the mods asking why my comment had been shadow-deleted three times.

Here is the comment they kept deleting (edited 3x to make it 'nicer' and 'nicer'):

&gt;&gt;I'm not rich. I paid 5 times what you did. try again.

&gt;You earned $200,000+ in a year and said "I'm not rich."

&gt;The government handed out a $600 "stimulus".

&gt;$600 is 14% (complete low-end - $250,000 is more likely) of what you might earn in **one week**.

&gt;More than that, **the median household income in my state is less than you paid in taxes**.

&gt;An entire household will earn less in a full year than you paid in taxes.

&gt;You think $200,000+ isn't "rich"? And that you're not taxed enough?

^ They refused to let me post this.

They said I violated the rule about wishing death on anyone.

Does this comment look like I wished death on anyone?

https://i.imgur.com/Y6swZt8.png

Please give me your honest opinion.  I'm trying to figure out how to grovel and beg to get unbanned. 

Obviously I was not wishing death on anyone but of course my opinion on myself would be bias.</div>

    <div class="md">Telling someone to "drop dead before their time" is literally wishing death on someone else bro. 🤔

Actually you said "free to..." instead of "feel free to" so perhaps it was misread, but I don't understand the context of your statement tbh.</div>

    <div class="md">OK, fair enough.   That's why I asked.

My comment was a response to the headline and the article.  The gov of SD is excusing the fact that her state has the 2nd highest death rate in America because in her state you have more FREEDOM to go about your business with ZERO mitigation effort of this deadly pandemic.  

In fact, considering the geographical size of her state and the sparse population, South Dakota has one of the highest COVID mortality rates in the world.  In the name of FREEDOM!  That was the intent of my comment.</div>

    <div class="md">Well it might help to say that to the mods. Best of luck 💗

As shitty as the r/politics mods are, they did talk things over with me when I messaged them regarding my ban (even though they were objectively wrong for banning me in my unbiased opinion :p).</div>

    <div class="md">What did you get banned for over there?  

If you don't mind?

I'm curious.  My ban seems so unfounded, it made me think that some alt-right user reported me and the mod never took a minute to actually look at my comment and the context.</div>

I think a lot of these mods are lonely drunkards with too much time on their hands and sometimes they behave a lot like the antagonists did in [THE STANFORD EXPERIMENT.](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+stanford+experiment&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00lUjvnr9OwQReu5ZcvhqGaoHXPQg:1614817606680&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjH1MqusJXvAhXGZc0KHeYNAHsQ_AUoAXoECBIQAw&amp;biw=1422&amp;bih=818)</div>
