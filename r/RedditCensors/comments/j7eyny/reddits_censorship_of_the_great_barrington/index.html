    <div class="md">I'm all for getting reddit to stop hindering peoples freedom. of speech, and reddit providing a way to re-enter society.  Even criminals who have stolen goods have a way to gain parole.

But not reddit users who are banned from some sub.  So if this is called censorship then also refer to "no you can't post in /r/conservative or /r/politics" as censorship too.

The US government sponsored the creation of the Internet.  There are a limited number of places where one can voice and share  opinions and if we choose to assemble with /r/politics or /r/conservative that is our right that is being tampered with. Moderation "without recourse" is maintained by reddit and it is censorhip  delegated in violation of the US Constitution PLUS lack of due process in violation of the US Constitution PLUS loss of privacy in violation of the US Constitution. 

These are serious problems.  If someone wants to stand up for the right of some organization to make stuff up and compare this serious disease to the flu then they also ought to let us be free as American citizens and have a path to return us - to be able to go back into /r/conservative and /r/politics without interference.

The American Enterprise Institute has made serious, and grave error that will cost people their lives.  We should have the right as reddit users to debate them in whatever forum they are in.

They are in error.


It's simply a matter of following what the law says.   If people here want the Koch brothers to claim that COVID-19 is the flu then they ought to be libertarian enough to support freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; I think you’re assuming away facts that need to be debated. 

Hey.  Except we don't get to debate if we're gagged.

&gt;precisely how the disease is and the correct public policy approach.

Let me put it this way. If we were to follow what the AEI said in April a lot more people would be dead already.  They're not medical doctors.  And the fact is, medicine has been providing good advice and keeping people from dying as the president almost did himself...

This is not something to fool around with.  COVID-19 is not "the flu" and some bunch of enterprise advocates who haven't got a hair brain clue probably shouldn't be spattering reddit users with advice that will kill them.

So if they get to do that I want to be able to argue with them.

Because they're wrong.

&gt;Shrieking and using terms like “Koch brothers” i

Don't know who is Shrieking

&gt;isn’t really a great proxy for thoughtful,

Don't know who isn't being thoughtful.


 but that sounds like a personal tone that I don't use.</div>

    <div class="md">Incorrect. Back in April little was known about the virus, it was assumed that the death toll will be catastrophic, we now know (through the swedish model) that is not the case, so it no longer makes sense to employ a total lockdown, and to ignore the damage the lockdown itself causes.

Why punish 100% of people when only 1% are affected?</div>

    <div class="md">Nothing I said is incorrect.  Yes, people knew less. But it has taken medical knowledge to find out.  When people come in contact they   spread the virus even if they don't die from it.

The argument being made is incorrect.

    <div class="md">What you said about following AEI and many more people dying is incorrect. That's a "begging the question" fallacy. There are many instances where this didn't happen, eg BLM/antifa protestors violating lockdown.

"Covid is not the flu" is not a valid debate point. I can retort by saying "covid isn't ebola either". We end up getting nowhere.</div>
