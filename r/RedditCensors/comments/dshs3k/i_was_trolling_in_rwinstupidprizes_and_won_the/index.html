&gt;unspoken rule

Well how was I supposed to know the rule if it's not put in the official sub rules? Besides, it should have been obvious since I did it as a comment reply rather than as private message like an actual ban message. Plus I told them it was a joke like 2 hours later + there's no **[M]** next to my name. I was just trying to be funny.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Well how was I supposed to know the rule if it's not put in the **official sub rules**?

First of all, you should have been using your head. Even if you were trying to be funny, perhaps you should have asked yourself, "Will impersonating a mod like this get me in trouble?"

Second, note I said "most online communities". I was trying to imply other communities outside of even reddit, just regular old forums as well that you can find anywhere. This kind of unspoken rule doesn't really need to be stated, it just screams "common sense" to me, no matter where you are on the web.

&gt; Besides, it should have been obvious since I did it as a comment reply rather than as private message like an actual ban message. Plus I told them it was a joke like 2 hours later + there's no [M] next to my name.

Always assume that people are less knowledgeable. Just because you and I know that's usually how it works here doesn't mean AverageJoe-87321 or MarySue-216 also knows that. 

Also, mods can post without mod capacity, without the [M] tag.</div>
