Since people keep referring to coerced government mandated injections as "a little inconvenience," I've been drawing the parallel to coerced fellatio (as a "little inconvenience") so that's the context of my banned comment.

It's meant to be disconcerting, but anyway.</div>

I love history. In all my years of studying history, I can't find any examples of people who were on the right side of history that wished death on people and their families, who used coercion and physical violence to push their agendas. In fact, the opposite is true. History is littered with many failed authoritarian regimes that were animated by masses of hate filled useful idiots who dehumanized their ideological enemies by parroting State propaganda that labeled their enemies unclean vermin, painted them as a threat to the State, and tried to round up and exterminate those threats.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; The death wishes violate the site wide rules and should be reported here https://www.reddit.com/report
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have gotten accounts in trouble with the admins by reporting them here, this is an admin level report so the admins can take action regardless of what the mods do

Funny you should say that. I moderate a conspiracy subreddit called /r/conspiracyII. The person who created the sub 4 years ago had their accounts suspended about 3 years ago. The new top mod invited an alternate account of theirs onto the sub as a mod. 4 years later, literally all the guy who was suspended and friends of theirs they appointed to mod positions (or alternate accounts of theirs) were doing was posting mainstream media articles about "Orange Man Bad" and "Conservatives are Nazis" that weren't even related to conspiracy theories. They were basically using the sub to push their politics. These folks started removing posts from people based on their personal opinions, removed comments, and banned users who questioned them. We told them that they could no longer use the sub to push their political views by abusing the mod privileges and posting nothing but Red Team bad content as their only contributions to the sub and that they had to be balanced so the sub didn't turn into TopMinds or Politics. A few mods left, a couple had to be removed because they refused to stop. In fact, one of the mods who left is active on another conspiracy sub were literally all they do all day long every day of the week is remove posts of people that they disagree with. Not even posts that violate community standards, or Reddit TOS. If this guy disagrees with you, they immediately remove your post then ban you.

Anyway, the person who started the sub but lost control of it years ago began to make threats that they were going to destroy the sub, they said they were going to "tear it all down." They kept saying "You can't do this" and talked like they physically owned the sub. They threatened to "destroy" me and the top mod. They said they had "dozens of alternate accounts." They said they knew the admins and they were in contact with an "elder mod" who was going to help show me "who is boss." They said we had "no idea what they're capable of." They said we made a "big mistake." They said "COME. AT. ME." They said they've been doing this since we "were in elementary school." They said they were a "pro" and that they were "special" and that Reddit made changes based on their input alone. They said we we're "surely not cut out for this." They said "You're not a real Redditor." They said they wrote a 240k word manifesto to get all conspiracy subs banned and that they paid a data analyst to help them write it. They said they "don't need Reddit to post it" and that "Twitter works well enough."  They said, "You ever chat with Snoop Dogg, Val Kilmer, or Taylor Swift? I have. I've spent many years developing contacts like this... You two are hell-bent on picking a fight with a very serious and studious motherfucker--all because you want to rule over a baby-/conspiracy subreddit with 15 users." They said all kinds of crazy things. Reddit TOS violations, Reddiquette violations, Moddiquette violations out the ass. Tons and tons of threats.

After reaching out to Modhelp and Modsupport I took their advice and banned this person from the community, muted them, and reported them to admins. Immediately after this happened, some mod who moderates a dozen subs posted on our sub repeating everything the guy who started the sub said, but in a kind of veiled threat kind of way, like the person we're talking about told them their side of the story and they had come to the sub to scare us on behalf of them. They said they were there to offer assistance and all kinds of stuff that also violates Moddiquette and Reddiquette and Reddit TOS. It's actually a violation of moddiquette for a mod to go to other subs and tell them how to run them, let alone threaten them and put a ";)" after each veiled threat.

I reported all of this stuff to the admins. I posted in Modsupport to ask for help and advice and the people in question followed me there and started harassing me there. I reported them there and the mods of that sub who are admins just told me to report them to Reddit with the report form you linked. They didn't even remove the posts of the person who was harassing me and violating Moddiquette. I had admins contact me via email in response to my report form I filled out earlier in regards to the harassment from the person who established the sub 4 years ago, I told them about this new situation with the mod offering "assistance," and all they told me is report them if it happens again. I linked that admin to the conversations with hundreds of messages where the founder of the sub violated all kinds of rules and made all kinds of threats, I gave them links to the mod offering "assistance," and absolutely nothing has been done. We had to take our sub private because they were brigading it. They're still making threats to the top mod who has yet to block them. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if these people didn't show up here because they stalk my posts with alts, mass down vote me, and comment with more crazy stuff. Still, admins have done absolutely nothing.

So, with all of that being said, it really baffles me that you said you have gotten people in trouble with admins for death wishes, but I can get stalked by a person for two weeks who is evading bans, evading blocks, a person who has made and is making threats, who is guilty of brigading and all kinds of Reddit TOS and Moddiquette and Reddiquette infractions, and absolutely nothing has been done to this person, or this group of people.</div>

    <div class="md">When I recently reported ban evasion with the linked form the accounts were suspended and I was sent a message confirming that they were ban evading and that action had been taken

The admins are really inconsistent however, I reported someone who said that politicians pushing vaccine mandates deserve to be publicly executed, and received a message that this did not violate the TOS!

Yet I was suspended for 3 day for a single F-bomb directed at a white supremacist

it also seems really random which cases of report button abuse and personal attacks they do and don't take action on, but I do know that this report form can get action taken, and a single comment that directly wishes death or serious harm seems like one of the more clear cut cases</div>

I may call someone a useful idiot, or say they're suffering from cognitive dissonance, but I've never told someone to "suckle my balls," personally attack them, threaten them, threaten their account, threaten their sub, stalk them, evade blocking and muting by using alternate accounts, or any of the other stuff this/these weirdos are doing. It shocks me how admins can get a link to these conversations, see what was said, see me being stalked and harassed, and do absolutely nothing about it.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; How would it violate the TOS?

Reveling in the death of others doesn't build community, nor does targeting people for harassment and bullying. You can go through Reddiquette and the site rules and then look at HermanCainAward and many other subs and it's pretty apparent how they're violating TOS. If there were a sub dedicated to mocking your average person who died from Covid, or died from Covid after getting vaccinated, the people who are on HermainCainAward would flip out and brigade that sub and report it constantly and stop at nothing to get it banned, but it's totally OK if they're mocking someone who dies of Covid because that person didn't get vaccinated, or because they're a Conservative, or just because they simply don't like them.</div>

&gt; It's a bunch of redditors circlejerking every time an unvaccinated person dies.

Exactly! TopMinds, IAmVerySmart, and many other subs exist simply to harass, bully, and mock people. While I'm not a fan of censorship and feel like they have a right to do what they're doing, Reddit will ban other subs simply because enough people get triggered and report that sub, while the above mentioned subs are allowed to violate all of these rules and guidelines...

"Reddit is a place for conversation, and in that context, we define this behavior as anything that works to shut someone out of the conversation through intimidation or abuse, online or off. Depending on the context, this can take on a range of forms, from directing unwanted invective at someone to following them from subreddit to subreddit, just to name a few. Behavior can be harassing or abusive regardless of whether it occurs in public content (e.g. a post, comment, username, subreddit name, subreddit styling, sidebar materials, etc.) or private messages/chat.

Being annoying, downvoting, or disagreeing with someone, even strongly, is not harassment. However, menacing someone, directing abuse at a person or group, following them around the site, encouraging others to do any of these actions, or otherwise behaving in a way that would discourage a reasonable person from participating on Reddit crosses the line."

"Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence."

"Do Not... Repost deleted/removed information. Remember that comment someone just deleted because it had personal information in it or was a picture of gore? Resist the urge to repost it. It doesn't matter what the content was. If it was deleted/removed, it should stay deleted/removed."

"Do Not... Be (intentionally) rude at all. By choosing not to be rude, you increase the overall civility of the community and make it better for all of us."

"Do Not... Follow those who are rabble rousing against another redditor without first investigating both sides of the issue that's being presented. Those who are inciting this type of action often have malicious reasons behind their actions and are, more often than not, a troll. Remember, every time a redditor who's contributed large amounts of effort into assisting the growth of community as a whole is driven away, projects that would benefit the whole easily flounder."

"Do Not... Conduct personal attacks on other commenters. Ad hominem and other distracting attacks do not add anything to the conversation."

"Do Not... Insult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion. Constructive Criticism, however, is appropriate and encouraged."

"Do Not... Troll. Trolling does not contribute to the conversation."

"Do Not... Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons."

"Do Not... Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts."

"Do Not... Report posts just because you do not like them. You should only be using the report button if the post breaks the subreddit rules."

"Do Not... Editorialize or sensationalize your submission title."</div>

    <div class="md">I don't think your post deserved a ban, but it was absolutely incredibly stupid. You literally take Nazi propaganda at face value to establish that the Nazis were socialists, s position that not a single respected historian today clings to.

In fact there is a mountain of evidence that lets us know that the main sponsors of the NSDAP were heavy industry like Thyssen Krupp, since they were going broke without a war to keep them afloat. We also do know for a fact that the Nazi policies - which matter much more than something Hitler said in some quote, as if he was reliable.. - were explicitly corporatist and capitalist. Lastly, the Nazis came to power by vehementlyopposing socialism and communism, the Nazis killed literal thousands of socialists and even moderate social Democrats (SPDler) were sonetimes sent to concentration camps.

The beautiful irony of your post is that you quote Strasser to prove that the Nazis were socialists, because apparently you're unaware that the Nazis themselves killed Strasser because he was too much of a leftist (he really wasn't, btw). This is all Wikipedia-tier knowledge that even highschoolers learn in Germany.

You call yourself an expert on Nazi and Communist propaganda, but your post reeks of someone who has never read a single monography about Nazi Germany in his life.

    <div class="md">The Nazis believed they were socialists. You saying they weren't really socialists because they killed the socialists who didn't align with their interpretation of socialism doesn't actually prove anything. You sound like a historian who aligns with socialist ideology who doesn't want the ideology they align with being associated with Nazism, and so you ignore everything they wrote and said because it wasn't "real" socialism.

    <div class="md">You seem to be very keen on being utterly in denial, so let me post some absolutely irrefutable evidence for you.

The nazis were never socialists, marxists or communists period. They rejected every vital tenet of socialism. They rejected class struggle, embraced private property (when it suited them) and their entire economic policy was one of privatization and corporatism, the literal opposite of socialism.

But you don't have to listen to me, why not listen to the leading authorities on this subject?

"Nazism rejected the Marxist concepts of class conflict and universal equality, opposed cosmopolitan internationalism, and sought to convince all parts of the new German society to subordinate their personal interests to the "common good", accepting political interests as the main priority of economic organisation, which tended to match the general outlook of collectivism or communitarianism rather than economic socialism."

This is paraphrased from Ian Kershaw, who was literally the leading authority on Nazism outside of Germany for decades.

Or you could go straight to the source, simply read "Road to Resurgence" by Hitler himself, an entire pamphlet with the only purpose of appeasing to wealthy industrialists and promoting policies that *they* would like. 

Or you could actually read "Mein Kampf" and realise that a sizeable portion of the book is literally about **anti-communism**, "anti-bolshevism" and other forms of anti-leftism. Virtually every historian in the world agrees that the Nazis were fervently anti-communist, **even moreso than other fascists**, like the Italians.

You want empirical evidence? No problem. How about this study, where the author clearly explains that the party consisted mostly of small businessmen and civil servants, and never actually had a foothold with socialists, or even workers in general. (I refer to page 295): [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026569148101100302?casa\_token=cND3mjvsdAkAAAAA:EMVzs6umO8Lqhb9uK7uMQPXhpWYnn2NmBI-XBHxKDAaFb9-wiuX7O9XZRVDei4zwCAo4m827LqcL](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026569148101100302?casa_token=cND3mjvsdAkAAAAA:EMVzs6umO8Lqhb9uK7uMQPXhpWYnn2NmBI-XBHxKDAaFb9-wiuX7O9XZRVDei4zwCAo4m827LqcL)

The paper even specifically states that the Nazis only named themselves socialists *as a grift*, to steal people away from the SPD and KPD. And surprise: It did not work at all. Before 1930 less than 7% of the members were actually industrial workers, and the industrial workers were overwhelmingly supporting actual socialists.

Still not convinced? How about an actual photo of the Nazis literally calling for the death of all Marxists: [https://cdn.britannica.com/39/71439-050-F63172BB/banner-Nazis-Tod-dem-Marxismus.jpg](https://cdn.britannica.com/39/71439-050-F63172BB/banner-Nazis-Tod-dem-Marxismus.jpg)

Even a highly conservative publication like Britannica is absolutely unanimous about the Nazis not being socialists. 

Richard Evans, the leading british authority on 20th century Germany, had this to say: "‘It Would Be Wrong to See Nazism as a Form of, or an Outgrowth From, Socialism’"

Joachim Fest, who was a Hitler biographer and leading German historian of the 3rd Reich said this: "This ideology took a leftist label chiefly for tactical reasons. It   
demanded, within the party and within the state, a powerful system of   
rule that would exercise unchallenged leadership over the “great mass of  
 the anonymous.” And whatever premises the party may have started with,   
by 1930 Hitler’s party was “socialist” only to take advantage of the   
emotional value of the word, and a “workers’ party” in order to lure the  
 most energetic social force. As with Hitler’s protestations of belief   
in tradition, in conservative values, or in Christianity, the socialist   
slogans were merely movable ideological props to serve as camouflage and  
confuse the enemy."

The superb irony of you claiming the Nazis were socialists in light of the indisputable fact that the Nazis indeed murdered all of the German socialists they could get their hands on is at best comical, at worst utterly depressing. From Wiki:"German Communists were among the first to be imprisoned in concentration camps"

"Imprisoned" of course being a nice euphemism for killed. Some of my own relatives were killed in concentration camps not for being socialists, but just moderate social democrats. 

I'll gladly own up to the historical failures of socialism, they were manifold. Stalin's Russia, the Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot were all *to some degre*e socialist, and were absolutely horrible. Nazi Germany wasn't. My post may reek of someone repeating what they're told, sure, but that's likely because I actually did spend a significant time studying the 3rd Reich, unlike you my friend.

Cheers!</div>
