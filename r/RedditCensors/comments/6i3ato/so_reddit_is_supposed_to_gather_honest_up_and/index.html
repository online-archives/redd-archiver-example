    <div class="md">Don't feel too bad, that is just what liberals do. They don't want to hear anything from anyone that might tell them something they don't like, so when you do, they treat the downvote button like a disagree button. 

This has the secondary effect of making sure you can only give them their medicine once every 10 minutes, which they like - and as an added benefit it also means that all they have to do, assuming you are still trying to discuss/debate/defend your position, is give you 6 replies(none of which had to wait the time out) and you are busy for a full hour defending and not attacking. Sound like a familiar tactic the left is using on Trump with unfounded accusation after unfounded accusation. It is their M.O. 

It also means we are still winning. </div>
