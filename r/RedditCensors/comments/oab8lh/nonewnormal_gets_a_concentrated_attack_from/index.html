    <div class="md">Odd. One possible explanation could be that the mod team there is trying to put together a post and have everything contained there. Limiting discussion of the topic could possibly keep people from “brigading” the bigger subs in retaliation and then having r/NoNewNormal closed because of it. You know the admins are just itching for them to “fuck up” somehow. 

It seems like the mod could just divulge that information to you if that was the case, though. Interesting to see how this pans out.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, making one sticky makes sense, then folks would know what is going on. But, they just delete every post and another mod keeps denying that it is even happening.

I could understand being confused about it, since there has been r/offmychest and r/justiceserved has been autobanning r/nonewnormal users for months. But, I told the mod and they banned the comment I made pointing it out...

I myself got banned from 2 subs yesterday morning (that I've never been in) and lots of people were pointing out that many new groups were in on targetting the sub, but all discussion was deleted.

I have a lot of comments in that sub and they have banned me (I guess permanently) for even mentioning the new assault (I guess since they never actually banned me or sent me a message, my comments and posts just don't show up).

Do you understand the comment that the mod left? I don't even know what they are trying to say to justify it.</div>

    <div class="md">So, there was the exchange in modmail where a mod said I was shadowbanned for no reason and they would undo it, but they didn't undo it. And then there was the public comment that a mod replied to (even though the comment was shadowbanned). In it, the mod seems to be talking about:

"I am thinking of writing something up about how I feel"

Who gives a fuck how you feel, just let people know what happened:

8 new major subs have started banning members of this sub, you'll probably be getting notices from them, but we are all getting them. We understand this is probably going to lead to us being shut down, and we are considering back-up sites, if anyone has any suggestions, it might be good to make a pre-emptive account there.

Instead, they are throwing folks into confusion. Tifu and Aww are major subs and prior to yesterday, they never autobanned folks from NNN. But instead of being able to ask about it, NNN mod's just delete and silence you? It seems like they are on the targeting NNN side of the discussion. Or at least one or two of the mods are.</div>

    <div class="md">The debate anti-vaxxers present has been thoroughly debunked since the early 20th century and their beliefs are derived from extreme right wing propaganda and the Q cult.

You may as well debate that the earth is flat.

I am done debating with these types of people .  I  can't change their minds if they are that far gone.   No good faith debate using verified facts can be used with them.  It is a waste of time.

I'm happy to debate a reasonable person about any subject as long as we are both grounded in reality.</div>

    <div class="md">Same thing.

Those people don't understand what 600K+ dead bodies looks like and can't comprehend that if no drastic, very costly mitigation efforts were implemented we would be experiencing millions of dead American bodies.

I understand that many healthy people in NoNewNormal don't give a fuck about that if the COVID pandemic didn't kill anyone they know and it only affected them financially.</div>

    <div class="md">You realize you're effectively talking to a bot, right?  Look at what they wrote and ask yourself if it was generic enough that it could be reused multiple times with minimal effort.  If it looks like it is generic enough to be reusable you're probably wasting your time talking to a NPC.

They don't care about nuance.  Look at the response you got.  They immediately dismissed your argued distinctions and bulled ahead talking about something else.  Or rather, continuing the propaganda effort they began in the previous post.

When someone talks past you it's time to ask who is it they are actually speaking to.  If it's to anyone other than you then you're probably wasting your time trying to engage with them.  They're just using you as a springing board to launch whatever points they wanted to talk about any how.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; You are aware that NoNewNormal isn't an anti vaccination subreddit, but rather a COVID is a hoax and the vaccine that is being pushed is incredibly dangerous (so dangerous that the creators in the US are legally immune from any lawsuits against them from side-effects or other issues with the drugs), as well as talking about how useless the lockdowns and mask mandates were.

I blame the CDC and WHO for not explaining in more simple terms to the USA and the world the thread that COVID is.

COVID has about the same mortality rate as the common flu that kills approx 20K-30K  Americans annually.  

The regular annual flu kills approx 0.1%-0.2% of all those who are infected.
About the same as Covid.   Not so scary, right?  I agree.   

But...THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS:  Covid19 is 10Xs more contagious than the regular flu.  Because of the mitigation we had for Covid hardly anyone caught the regular flu virus!

Regular flu is contagious about 1 day before someone shows symptoms.

COVID is highly contagious for about 2 weeks and whoever has it will not know it unless tested and for 2 weeks may show no symptoms, mild symptoms, very serious to fatal symptoms after that 2 weeks.  All the while spreading it.

MILLIONS of people never catch the regular flu virus because it's not that contagious.  It's easy to avoid.

COVID is an insidious contagious virus that can infect millions before they know they have it.

That's why we had over 600K Covid deaths in 1 year instead of 20K like the regular flu.

If we had taken no mitigation efforts such as lock downs and masks we would have MILLIONS of Americans dead from this instead of 600K.

The vaccine for Covid is similar to vaccines offered for the regilar flu.  It's not a hoax.

I am very fucking angry that the CDC and WHO did not explain that the danger was the EXTREME CONTAGION abilities of this virus and instead they focused more on telling the public how dangerous it is if you catch it.  Because it's not that dangerous for a healthy person.  

If we had taken no extreme mitigation efforts we would have lost millions in 1 year instead of 600K.   A whole generation of seniors along with many younger people with existing conditions of all ages.

The other difference with Covid is, even if you are young and healthy and catch it, COVID-19 leaves many people who survive severe symptoms with permanent lung and/or brain injury.  Regular flu doesn't do that.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, you can check the entire sub, there is not one mention anywhere of the 8 major subs autobanning. It's blocked throughout the group.

My shadowban seems to have started when a mod said this was old news and I said multiple new subs started doing it this morning and then that and every comment after that doesn't show up.

One of the greatest censorship campaigns in reddit history happens yesterday morning and by the end of lunch, all mention of it is removed, on the sub it is happening to on the day it is happening.</div>

    <div class="md">\&gt;As many of you are probably aware at this point, there has been a growing trend of other subreddits' who have implemented both automatic and manual policies and processes to ban users of r/nonewnormal from their subs for simply participating here.

The mod completely ignores reality and pigeonholes the sub from it's enemy's perspective.

The reality is:

\&gt; As many of you are probably aware at this point, there has been a growing trend of other subreddits' who have implemented both automatic and manual policies and processes to ban users of r/nonewnormal from their subs for simply participating here. This indicates a growing push to have us ousted from reddit. Their current autobanning will not be enough for them and as a large contingent taking ownership of our removal, we will likely be gone shortly.

\&gt; What not to do: don't spam this sub with "I'm banned posts". If someone makes such a post, let them know that there is a manage push against us and we are all getting these messages. Also, don't brigade the subs who are sending the bans.

\&gt; What to do: we've created a back up at [www.whatever.com](https://www.whatever.com). Sign up there and when the super-mods get enough momentum to remove this sub from reddit, we'll be able to carry on over there.

Instead, the mod has no plan and basically takes the position that folks are brigading those groups...that they have been mass banned from? Doesn't even make since. 

Doesn't solve the issue of people posting about their bans. They will just get deleted and shadowban, leaving them confused. And it doesn't solve the issue of what happens when they ban the group. 

I feel vindicated in that I realized they were fucking up, and that they continue to do so.</div>

Let's ignore the fact that they keep forcing people on ventilators and refusing to give people any other treatment, which has been shown clinically to drastically reduce risk.

    <div class="md">The problem with your statistic is COVID is much more contagious than the regular flu with also kills between 0.1% to 0.2% of people it infects.  Same mortality as COVID19.

To put it simply, the **regular annual flu kills 20K to 30K** people per year, most with preexisting conditions (but not all) and we never did lock downs and masks with regular flu.

COVID is much more contagious than regular flu.

Most people with regular flu are contagious for about 1 day before they show symptoms and it is contagious once symptom begin.

**With COVID-19, they could be contagious for up to 2 weeks without ever showing symptoms.  After 2 weeks being non-symptomatic they can get no symptoms, very mild or severe symptoms.  But they have been contagious and spreading the virus all that time.** That's the difference.

That's why the USA had approx **600,000 deaths** in 1 year from COVID.

 If we had no lock downs, no masks and no social distancing we would have had **MILLIONS of COVID deaths.**

Get it?</div>

    <div class="md">Jesus. Look mate, do both of us a favor. Go to NNN or any other negationist, alt-right conspiracionist subreddit, chan, facebook or wherever the hell, tell them how you, the bastion of the redpill woke from the lies of the media, argued with this bluepilled covid-fanatic who wanted to censor you and you absolutely DESTROYED his arguments. 

You're not worth the time. You live in your own hive-mind, but people like you won't spoil my day anymore. 520 thousand deaths, that's the number we're dealing with in Brazil.

And, just in case you say I'm running from your arguments, border closure, masks, mass testing and lockdown are basic pandemic response measures, once a pandemic is detected. 

Have a good day, friend.</div>

    <div class="md">Strange eh, you have such a high number of deaths. Wonder why Singapore has 1 death per 2500 cases? 

Why do studies put the IFR at 0.15% and Brazil has 520k deaths? That would put Brazils population far over 400m. 

Ah, because 520k is a fake number, falsely attributed to covid? That does make sense.</div>

Well I checked all your comment on this post and you're right. I must've mis-remembered from reading another thread on this post.

I oppose censorship for the most part. There's a fallacy called the tolerance fallacy which basically states if you are blanket tolerant of everything the intolerant will take over. 

How would you feel if the leaders of ISIS were able to go on Instagram live and broadcast their extremist beliefs and executions. Or Osama Bin Laden had been able to Tweat propaganda from his caves? 

There has to be some exceptions and you can't tell me you don't believe in at least one.

And here you are comparing getting shadow banned from r/aww to sailors getting bombed in Pearl Harbor? That's an exception to me. Do you have any respect for our military at all?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm comparing one attack to another attack.

One is an attack based on censorship and the other was a military attack. In the military attack, they notified people what was happening and how to respond. That, I think, is a pretty standard way of dealing with an attack. In this, they did the opposite, they hid the attack and banned their own members for trying to inform their own side that an attack was happening.

\&gt;

So, I am a scientist. I have a science degree. I have been both leading and supporting author on many published studies. I currently help doctors get their papers published in major international journals. It seems that you assume you know more about science than I do, though. And you seem to feel you are able to appropriately discuss what would be scientifically intolerable. You don't have such qualifications though. This is obvious from what you have written, so please stick to what you know, which seems to be very little.</div>

My 8 year old cousin started a conversation with those same exact words on Sunday.

All the qualifications in the world don't mean jack shit if you're still wrong. If you think having all those qualifications means you can't be wrong you're extra fucked.

&gt;I'm comparing one attack to another attack.

No shit. They are just wildly disproportionate to compare to each other and beyond that historically inappropriate. Especially considering one was an attack lead by fascists while the other was an attack on fascists. 

&gt;And you seem to feel you are able to appropriately what would be scientifically intolerable. 

Well considering what goes on in the one sub I know you're active in; neither are you. As a matter of fact I would say the primary thing that would qualify a censorship of speech is someone spreading beliefs that lead directly to endangering lives of not just followers but those near to them. 

You don't know what qualifications or experience I have dealing with these issues and I damn sure don't feel the need to anonymously stroke my own ego, as you do. You just decide you're better so I'm not worth discussing with? Sounds like a Crowder retreat to me.</div>

You are saying that scientific knowledge that contradicts your cherished narrative should be censored. This automatically disqualifies you for making a judgement. Nothing else is required to disqualify you. You don't know who, what or how it was discovered, but because it would support a "no new normal" you call it "intolerable".

You can have a PhD in physics or another hard science, but that belief would itself still disqualify you. This is not a no true scotsman fallacy. Science has a basis and someone who directly refuses to accept the basic foundation is not able to then use that foundation to make any determination because they've began with a false premise.</div>

    <div class="md">Wait, wait, are you talking about the "scientific knowledge" on NoNewNormal? There's no way you have a degree in anything not offered by a 2 year community college. If you even have one.

I am most definitely not saying that scientific knowledge that contradicts my narrative should be censored. I said false information should be allowed, false information that leads to endangering lives and leads to death should be censored. As a matter of fact I believe very strongly that science changes over time and just because we previously thought something was fact; i.e. CDC recommending not having to wear masks at the start of Covid to the CDC changing their mind and wanting everyone to wear masks. Comes from a place of acquiring new knowledge and understanding and evolving around the new conclusion. 

The best part is you're speaking in assumptions and false determinations because I have not argued with any direct source of information from NoNewNormal all I have said is that they're alt-right and their beliefs lead to deaths and endangering lives. 

If you want to have a discussion on specific articles and sources of information bring them up.

You got so far off track I forgot what this was originally about. Your Pearl Harbor comment. By you not replying to that part of the comment I'll take that as an apology and acknowledgement you were wrong for making that comparison.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;I am most definitely not saying that scientific knowledge that contradicts my narrative should be censored.

Yes you did. You said the NoNewNormal was intolerable. NoNewNormal offers valid scientific data performed by scientists according to the scientific method.

I know you don't really get what that means, so I will give you an example:

Fauci wrote in an email: if the IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) of covid is between 0.3 - 0.5%, then covid should be treated like the flu.

This is called "falsification" which was determined by a scientist called "Karl Popper" (he was a scientist, you can ask your cousin about him) as the way differentiate between science and pseudoscience, ie if there is no way to disprove a theory, then there can be no way to verify it and hence it is not science.

So, Fauci, who some would say is a scientist, gave a method of falsifying the idea that covid is a serious  problem requiring inordinate attention: the death rate.

https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/  
Most of the studies are from locations with overall COVID-19 mortality rates that are higher than the global average. The inferred median infection fatality rate in locations with a COVID-19 mortality rate lower than the global average is low (0.09%). If one could sample equally from all locations globally, the median infection fatality rate might even be substantially lower than the 0.23% observed in my analysis.

And in September, we can see that the WHO put the death rate far below the minimum bounds he'd set and therefore, it would be pseudoscience to refer to it as anything more.

Since you don't have anything to add, that is not pseudoscientific, I'll assume you'll have thanked me mentally and feel improved with the knowledge you know have or that your cousin has explained to you after reading my comment.</div>

    <div class="md">My 8 year old cousin had this to say:

Why do you ignore all but one part of my comment you think you have a reply to? 

&gt;Yes you did. You said the NoNewNormal was intolerable. 

Just look back at my comments, no I didn't. 

You can't just put words in people's mouths and then argue around a point they didn't make.

&gt;Fauci wrote in an email: If the IFR

Yes but as I said previously, Fauci later reassessed his conclusion after more information was attained. That's one of the best parts of science, being able to admit you were wrong because you know more thereafter.</div>
