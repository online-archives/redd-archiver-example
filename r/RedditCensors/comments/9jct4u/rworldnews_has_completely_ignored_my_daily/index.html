      <div class="md">Here is my original message that I sent eight days ago:

&gt;Good evening, 

&gt;I posted an article tonight on the Mueller investigation in to Russian collusion. Here is the post I submitted:

&gt;Trump orders feds to declassify key FISA documents, text messages in FBI Russia probe https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9gpo2p/trump_orders_feds_to_declassify_key_fisa/

&gt;The post was removed for being "Internal US Politics." I believe this may have been a mistake and am requesting the post be reinstated. /r/WorldNews has had no issue hosting myriad posts on the Mueller investigation and alleged Russian collusion. Here are some examples:

&gt;Cohen's lawyer says he's completely flipped and will give evidence that Trump colluded with Russia https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/99cs3k/cohens_lawyer_says_hes_completely_flipped_and/

&gt;Trump said on Monday he was worried that any statements under oath he provides Mueller could be used to bring perjury charges against him as part of the probe into Russia’s electoral interference. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/98z9k1/trump_said_on_monday_he_was_worried_that_any/

&gt;Manafort to plead guilty in Mueller probe https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9fshvf/manafort_to_plead_guilty_in_mueller_probe/

&gt;A Series Of Suspicious Money Transfers Followed The Trump Tower Meeting: Investigators are focused on two bursts of banking activity — one shortly after the June 2016 meeting, the other immediately after the presidential election. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9f9wzt/a_series_of_suspicious_money_transfers_followed/

&gt;Furthermore, here is a good example of straight up internal US politics that was completely allowed:

&gt;President Trump has promised for years that Mexico would pay for a vast border wall. Now, in the Trump administration’s campaign to stop illegal immigration, the United States plans instead to pay Mexico $20 million in foreign assistance funds to deport as many as 17,000 people. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9fe54o/president_trump_has_promised_for_years_that/

&gt;These posts were allowed to remain while mine was removed. I can only believe, then, that my post was removed by mistake. Please reinstate the post, or please explain why my post on the Mueller investigation in to alleged Russian collusion is considered "internal US politics" but these other posts I have used as examples are somehow not. Thank you.

I've messaged every day asking them for a reply. In each message, I have copied my original message. It has been eight days now and they have completely ignored my original message as well as my daily messages letting them know that I am still waiting. I've submitted an official complaint using the form. Reddit modiquette states:

&gt;Try to respond to all of your moderator mail, even if you cannot address it in a timely manner.

It's almost like they just censored my post and they have no way to explain why without admitting it was just because it went against their narrative. </div>

That's all you need to know. They have rules for thee, not for me. 
They have claimed "politics at a world level" since they  got GTFO by President Trump in 2016. So they pick and choose which Pro-President Trump posts they allow (none) and break the rules for every other post they want which they believe supports their agenda.

That is the problem with reddit.


The admins tacitly approve of this kind of behavior when it's done for things they agree with. But boy are they quick when its something they dont agree with...</div>
