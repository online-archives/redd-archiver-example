    <div class="md">I was feeling a bit feisty after I saw 95% of the comments removed by mods in that thread weren't racist, and I didn't see any slurs. I think the most egregious example I found were some comments critical of urban black culture that enables this--hardly a reason to nuke the whole thread.

Needless to say, the mod didn't like the mildest of the mild of DMs, so I got banned and called racist. You can bet if the races were reversed, that thread would be up all day despite any number of calls for retribution or wayward pejoratives about the offenders skin color. That's pretty racist if you ask me.

edit: I should add this type of double standard has been applied to a few threads per week for as long as I've lurked, so it's not really "if something different happened would something different happen" since that implies guesswork. Shits getting old.</div>

    <div class="md">There's definitely racism directed at every race on here just given the amount of people on this site, but yeah, there's quite a lot directed specifically at whites without it being labelled or punished as such. It's a chilling effect and helps literally no one to treat it asymmetrically like this. A douche bag is a douche bag.</div>
