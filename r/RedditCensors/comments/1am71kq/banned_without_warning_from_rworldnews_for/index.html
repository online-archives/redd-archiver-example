    <div class="md">Lol sure,  


r/news \- I said  "This is reddit independent thought is not allowed" Banned for that comment, no explanation beyond that.  


r/Conservative \- I got banned twice in one day for two comments believe it or not   


Comment 1 - in response to a non-sequitur about my comment I said - "What? I think you may want to work on your reading comprehension, Trump instigated the riots on Jan 6. He also attempted a coup by sending fake electors to the capitol." They didn't say what rule I broke on that one.   


Comment 2  In regards to a study claiming  high school age boys are leaning conservative - "Yeah I never got laid in high school either" On this one they said I broke the "no shit posting" rule

r/ScienceUncensored \- I was going thru a thread arguing with science denying skeptics, no explanation given.   


r/climateskeptics \- I created a couple posts that were like a game show where I argued with more science denying skeptics, but to debate me in my post I stated there were rules like you have to respond to the claim in the op, and all claims must be sourced. Eventually mod banned me for answering an off topic question from him with, "Sorry contestant, contestants must answer the question in the op in order to debate!!!"  


r/ProtectAndServe \- There was the incident with the protesters who blocked the road to burning man last year. I got in a protracted debate with several ppl in the sub claiming the cops acted appropriately when I thought they didn't. No explanation given.</div>

> This is a much more accurate version than the one on r/Conservative a couple days ago.

> Since they censored my response because they are afraid of dissent over there I'll just repost it here:

> Yeah, just a few of the "little" things that conservatives and liberals disagree on:

> Separating children from their families and imprisoning them long-term as a "deterrent"

> Unlimited dark money in U.S. politics - Citizens United

> Attempting to involve foreign powers in our elections.

> These are not "little" things, these are the consequences from governing by a party who has no conscience and is supported by a large group of ignorant people who only engage with the issues very superficially.




"I like to debate and usually civil"

Commented on /r/protectandserve




> Oh no dont block the rich people from getting to their drug fueled orgy!! That was a good protest, I imagine they'll get more attention than they expected. That cop was unhinged and of course not responding proportionally to the situation. Reminds me of the George Floyd protests. Oh btw the desert there is basically a big flat parking lot most of those ppl could've just went around.

EDIT: banned from bootlicker central, I'll consider that a badge of honor. Good day bootlickers!




Again on /r/protectandserve




> That's rich coming from a cop lol.. 7 years in the infantry and there's only a couple jobs im qualified for, being a cop, and rolling burritos.

Aside from these behaviors though, you're welcome to voice your opinions and respectfully debate. 


Do you also see /r/news, /r/politics etc to be fascist echo chambers for banning right leaning opinions? These aren't even specifically left leaning subs.

Your ultimate MAGA boogy man already had power for 4 years. No genocide happened. In fact, most of the things you folks accused him of, the democrats ended up doing. </div>

    <div class="md">I don't know about any of these things and I've learned to not go on wild goose chases based on baseless accusations on reddit. I've done this dozens of times, and it ALWAYS turns out to be hyperbole, clips taken wildly out of context, or downright lies. 


You all still repeat the "very fine people" lie. 


So show your work or take the F. 


How about some accusations against your party? Your side of the political aisle is unabashedly corrupt. They're willing to send our tax dollars and our soldiers to war in a country on the other side of the planet so "the big guy" can get his 10%. The big guys son sold access to his VP father and made millions in the process. They openly want to undermine our constituon and revoke basic human rights. They want to pack the court and open the borders in a feeble attempt to shift the demographic. They committed voter fraud and are weaponizing the justice system against their political opponents. Your congressional leaders are best known for insider trading and making millions off the backs of the working man. They want to genocide conservatives. Nobody is trying to hide it. They're proud of it. 


I'm not going to show evidence of any of this. I want you to take my accusations as fact, just as you want me to take yours as fact. </div>

    <div class="md">At least these are political or strongly opinionated subs.  I got banned from more than a dozen non political subs for politely disagreeing with complete madness.  I was permanently banned from r/entertainment for replying to a post stating that anyone who buys hogwarts legacy is a transphobe that “buying a product does not mean you endorse all of the political and personal views of the CEO”

Whitepeopletwitter is probably the easiest sub on Reddit to get banned from because it might be the biggest cesspool echo chamber on the whole of the internet.  Saying Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted or acted in self defense is a quick way to get banned there.  Asking for evidence of ludicrous charges like if someone says “Mike Pence is a gang rapist and child murderer” will get you banned inside of 5 minutes.</div>

    <div class="md">Never said it was and Reddit is probably one of the most bias, censorious places on the internet but you should expect to be kicked out of political subs for pushing against the bubble unfortunately.  It’s when you are kicked out of what should be completely nonpartisan subs for benign statements that is troubling.</div>

This is censorship. Cultivating echo chambers is censorious.. thats why its bad. If anything getting banned from a non political sub for debating politics is less of a problem.</div>

The rich are really good at victimizing themselves so well that any moves of self defense of the working class is viewed as being Fascism with a Communist badge.

    <div class="md">We've never seen any examples of Communism though, just Socialism, and every single instance has been met with US & UK intervention whether boots on the ground, bombing, staged coups, or espionage. Many of those cases are the fascists were put into power by the US all the while the US was telling the public that they are 'Communist Fascist.' Pinochet is a great example of that one.</div>

    <div class="md">Sure there is ppl like being in echo chambers, it lets them feel morally superior. Not to mention for hobby subs the same tools that allow political subs to become echo chambers, allow the hobby subs to keep trolls out and keep the subs hobby centric. Reddit is just inherently bad for political discourse, which some bad actors have realized and capitalize on, which provides another source of demand.</div>

    <div class="md">I’m all against censorship but is that telegram even verified? I’ve seen thousands of channels with videos not even from the same continent ffs. I get it from both sides but you lack critical thinking if you just blindly accept the word of someone on a back end channel. 

Here’s some advice if it was the IDF posting it you wouldn’t have public access.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, it looks like all major subreddits are "influenced" by certain parties to push their narratives.

I dared to link to Japanese researchers who measured Cesium at Fukushima and got a [permaban from /r/worldnews. Apparently it's "trolling" to link to scientifically peer reviewed literature LOL - https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/13vbuhs/rogue_mod_in_rworldnews/

And I got a permaban from /r/korea/ for daring to disagree with some troll claiming that hunting down koreans was right and "patriotic". Yeah, you can't disagree witht he notion that hunting down koreans is wrong LOL - https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/r7bbwa/rkorea_mods_permabanning_people_who_question_the/

Just assume that reddit is a propaganda machine. Places like worldnews sell themselves to the highest bidder and that probably makes reddit a lot of money.</div>
