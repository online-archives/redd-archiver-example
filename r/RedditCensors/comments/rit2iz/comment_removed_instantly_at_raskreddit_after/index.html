&gt;[5 minute excerpt from Joe Rogan's interview of Dr. Peter McCullough - We Could Have Stopped 85% of Covid-19 Deaths With Early Treatment](https://rumble.com/vqptgi-dr.-peter-mccullough-we-could-have-stopped-85-of-covid-19-deaths-with-early.html) and https://hongkongfp.com/2020/03/14/china-may-prevented-95-virus-cases-acted-silenced-whistleblowers-warning/ And if gain of function research wasn't happening in Wuhan (that was funded by Fauci and co) this pandemic may never have happened. Edit: And if Fauci had told Americans early on that mask were effective and show them how to make them, rather than told them the opposite, that may have saved lives, and if we had M4A during a pandemic, that may have saved lives, and if Cuomo hadn't mishandled the nursing homes that may have saved lives. If we didn't politicize covid-19 and potential treatments (which were demonized directly because some right-wingers also mentioned them) that might have saved lives. What if Fauci told people from the start of the arrival of the vaccines to not just take the vaccine but also take vitamins and lose wight, how many lives might this have saved? Think of how many people were censored early on when they called out any of the above. Think of how many lives might be saved if we were allowed to discuss this stuff and hold these people accountable? Think about how people were radicalized to tribalism enabling an absolutist (us or them) mindset, politicizing covid to the point of people having no remorse, taking enjoyment in seeing others catch it, be refused tests or treatment and even die from it. They got people hating those who are against mandates, despite the fact that many of those in power who are for mandates, were against mandates in addition to spreading vaccine hesitancy under the previous administration. They have people hating on people like myself just for pointing out the above and asking these questions.

I messaged the mods and they messaged me back 4 hours later saying it was removed for violating rule 10. I replied by saying that I think it may have been automod that removed it (as my comment disappeared when I logged off) and asked what part of my post was harmful misinformation. I have yet to hear back. I am truly curious to know what about it is misinformation, let alone harmful misinformation. I guess AskReddit doesn't want to you contribute/participate unless you self censor and stick to approved discourse, which doesn't seem about healthy debate and enlightenment but an echo-chamber of authoritative talking points, which are often propaganda and misinformation in and of itself that enables tribalism, confirmation bias and narrow-mindedness.

Edit: I should mentioned more explicitly  how the pandemic is used to divide Americans (which is something that is/was already being done with race, by the two party duopoly and MSM) but also how it has promoted a rise/embrace of censorship/authoritarianism (on the left) and also how it has made the rich even richer, while showing the true colors of the political establishment - that refuses to bail out Americans during a pandemic (asking how will we pay for this or that) while having endless money for war and defense, for which they never ask 'how will we pay for it.' This is what the pandemic has helped highlight.

Did some digging and see they made a megathread months back when Reddit mods were banding together to censor people over covid discussion. This is what censorship looks like: https://i.imgur.com/AxgaGy0.jpg
