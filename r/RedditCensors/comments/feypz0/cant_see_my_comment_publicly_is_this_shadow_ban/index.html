I can see it if I am logged in, but not incognito. I was surprised to have zero engagement. Is it that the sub has to approve these or something? What reddit functionality is causing this behavior? I do not have any indicators either way. Was hoping this sub could help me understand what is happening. This may break Rule 4 on this sub, but isn't a ban as far as I can tell and I wasn't sure how else to learn about what is happening to me here.

    <div class="md">it's a shadowban.  you can see it logged in but no one else can.  reddit is intentionally lying to you.  sometimes it's triggered by individual keywords, sometimes a blanket ban for you on the entire sub, and sometimes they manually do it.

r-politics is especially nasty about it with any facts that go against their ridiculous radical left narrative.</div>

    <div class="md">So if your stuff ever gets deleted, it will always appear normal to you, even under a shadowban. There’s no way to tell who deleted it, Reddit doesn’t expose that information. Usually though, admins nuking stuff comes alongside a site ban.

The quickest way to tell is to log out or check in a private tab, or use an undeleter like revddit.

A shadowban just means your stuff is deleted the moment you post it, anywhere in the site. This is an admin only thing. Mods of individual subreddits can do a subreddit shadowban by setting automoderator to filter your posts.</div>

What you do is replace the letter "r" in reddit with the letter "c" in the URL and you can get some idea of what is happening.
