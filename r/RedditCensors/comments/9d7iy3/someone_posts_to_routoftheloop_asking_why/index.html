    <div class="md">Straight from their sidebar:

&gt;You must post a full and completely clear, unbiased question about a specific event or trend in the title.

Here's the comment that somehow didn't break this rule. The bolding is mine:

&gt;They chose Colin Kaepernick to represent them in an ad campaign. Colin Kaepernick was a American Football player that chose to protest the treatment of black Americans at the hands of law enforcement by kneeling during the national anthem played before the games. Initially this didn't even get noticed, but the media picked up on it and it became very widely publicized. Other players began to follow suit, and it became a debate about whether or not it was disrespectful to the armed forces and America as a whole.

&gt;Colin Kaepernick was eventually released by his team and was never hired by another team, even though he likely played well enough to at least become a backup player. The fact that he was never signed by another team caused him to sue the league saying he had been blacklisted. The protests continued in the meantime but had largely stopped being in the media until last season when Trump decided to make it an issue again by talking and tweeting about it. He told teams to fire the players protesting among other things.

&gt;This brings us to him being the choice to lead the campaign. Conservatives are calling to boycott Nike because they chose him. It's pretty hard to argue that Nike is saying they're wrong for vilifying him. They are a company, so they've likely decided they will make more money appealing to other groups than they will by falling into line with what Trump believes.

&gt;**To editorialize a little**, this is all monumentally stupid on the part of the people calling for a protest of Nike. Colin Kaepernick chose the method of protesting he did because he didn't want to be disrespectful and actually asked a former army member what would be a respectful way to protest. Every thing since then has been so poorly handled by the media and by Trump that this relative non-issue of an athlete making a rather mild gesture of protest has now morphed into corporations, athletes, politicians, and the military fighting about nothing related to the underlying problem/issue.

That definitely breaks rule two. He might as well have said "to break rule 2 a little." Wonder why the comment was allowed to stay, but this one got censored away?

&gt;Based on your last paragraph, I get the sense you’re missing the point, but please correct me if I’m wrong.
The fact that Kaepernick protested, and the way he did it isn’t as much the issue as what he was protesting.
A large segment of the population believes that the disparity in crime statistics between black and white Americans is not due to some systemic oppression led by racist police. Rather, it’s due to the (many) failings within “the black community”, and “African American culture”, neither of which are are shaped by white males in America.
That same segment of the population believes he wasn’t a very noteworthy QB, yet Nike chose to elevate his message as a form of virtue signaling.

Remember, the mods have an agenda and will throw out the rule book if that means allowing comments in support of that agenda. But if you try to challenge that, get ready to be censored away.

Bonus points to the mod that locked the post, /u/_korbendallas_, for truly caring about people's ability to participate in the subreddit discussion. Check out the full comment:

&gt;Marking this as answered. Leaving unlocked until I get tired of banning people for rule 4 violations.

&gt;Just Be Civil™

&gt;Edit: Ok, I'm done with this. Locked.

&gt;Edit 2: [For the people reporting this comment. ](https://i.redd.it/una4q7yv1bk11.jpg)

&gt;Edit 3: For the weirdos PMing me about how you didn't get to express your valuable opinion: I don't care, don't message me.

&gt;Edit 4: Thanks for the gold, but please stop sending me videos of yourselves masturbating into shoes. As a lib, I can only get so owned before completely rejecting capitalism.</div>

    <div class="md">Hey! Thanks for coming here and sharing your thoughts with us. We're a subreddit dedicated to documenting all censorship on Reddit. Typically we only have one side of this though, where we find and document. It's great to see the other side's perspective from the person doing the censoring.

Thanks again and have a great day. </div>

    <div class="md">Yes, you should let adults say what they want and let the community decide. That's exactly what in saying. I'm sure it just coincidence that the ones that meet the completely subjective ambiguos standard of breaking the rules just so happen to be opposition  to your opinions.

    <div class="md">Did you just link to a thread that made my point for me?  You're also breaking your own vague, easily misused rule of "being civil" right now. I'm shocked that you don't hold yourself to the same standards you hold others (that disagree with you) to. The level of delusion to not see the hipocrisy is astounding. </div>

Better block me so you can avoid ideas you dislike. You know I can see the deleted comments in that thread, right? You deleted anything that even mentioned race in a way disagree with. It's completely obvious there was an agenda in removing certain comments that had nothing to do with "the rules." </div>

*Pay to fuck me, yes. I like to fuck fresh young 20 year olds. Is this the best you've got? Lmao. You should come out of your basement and try to fuck an instagram porta potty. You haven't lived if you haven't. Truly, it's so much better than fucking a neckbearded FtM tranny as I know that's the likely extent of your sexual experience.</div>
