    <div class="md">Reddit is really salty that a bunch of white teenage Trump supporters weren't actually in the wrong, and were in fact the victims of this whole debacle. So like the progressives that they are, they are doing their damnedest to try to make them seem as shitty as possible by posting as many out-of-context videos as they can muster up. Then on top of that, they are intentionally suppressing the full two-hour-long context video of the entire incident, which exonerates pretty much everyone there except the Black Israelites, who somehow got a free pass by the media despite literally calling these kids the N-word and saying that Gays shouldn't have rights. 

What a fucking world we live in. I'm honestly at a loss for fucking words at this point. </div>

    <div class="md">There's definitely some underlying hatred for white men/christians that's playing into these overreactions. Bari Weiss, a nytimes reporter implied as much on Joe Rogan's podcast yesterday when she said that she initially disliked Nick Sandman (the smirking kid) based solely on the way that he looked because he supposedly reminded her of a bully. She though she masked her racism, but it falls apart when you remember that we don't validate the people on the far right who became racist after being beat up/robbed/raped by a black person. </div>
