    <div class="md">This is crazy to me. Only 2 posts about it on the front page, buried at the bottom with vague headlines like "police warning after explosion". It's clear they are trying to make this as low visibility as possible, they don't want most reddit users to even notice. A ton of effort is being put forth by the mods/admins of Reddit to make sure this hardly gets any attention at all. I can't believe most people on Reddit either don't notice or don't care. It's the most blatant, inorganic manipulation. 

Their goal is so that it doesn't even cross the mind of most Redditors, anything that paints Islam in a negative light is immediately buried. What a joke.</div>

    <div class="md">As a former soldier I use to quote kindom of heaven to people who said religion is evil "I put no stock in religion. By the word ‘Religion’ I have seen the lunacy of fanatics of every denomination be called the ‘Will of God.’ Holiness is in right action, and courage on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves, and goodness. What God desires is here…(points to head)and here… (points to heart) and by what you decide to do every day, you will be a good man. Or not. - hospitaller"</div>

They don't give a damn about Islam except as a vehicle to further their agenda, what I'm really wondering is what's the whole end game here, just about all of the top shills are over 50 years old, what do they think they can possibly get out of this?</div>

    <div class="md">[Confessions of a post modernist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgu1jjZlV_0) is something I found enlightening.  

They reject western principles, values and morals. Embracing Cynicism and Criticism in hopes of finding something better but they never did. They searched for years, they built their identity around that idea there's something better, but they never found it so now they are stuck defending that identity their lives revolve around.  

When they discovered they could find nothing that mattered to them, they decided nothing matters at all, and embraced nihilism. Even if they can't build a better society, they still want to reduce this one to ash in hopes that something better grows.    

---------  

TL: DR   

You know those people who reject capitalism, a system that is flawed but works, and always push for communism, a system that is *theoretically* flawless and so *never works*? No matter how many times communism fails?  

Yeah, they're those kinds of people.</div>

    <div class="md">It's not about that, it's really about the money and the inevitable war/riots. You alienate a large group of people like that and things will turn ugly. Also denouncing Islam as a whole will make the problem worse, it's what the extremists wants so they can say, 'look, America hates you as a whole and they're banning your way of life'. Then people will really get irate.</div>

    <div class="md">Given the history of these types of attacks, it's a Muslim. People guess Muslim, get comments removed and/or banned.
Attacker was Muslim.

People sitting on the social fence see how the left keeps hiding the truth, or perverting it to fit their agenda. These people take a step closer to the "right" (whatever you want to call it) of the fence looking for the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts, but you still have to hear it. The head on sand approach doesnt work.
