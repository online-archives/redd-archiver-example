    <div class="md">That threat took a *long* time to load on ceddit. Be patient. 

Here are some comments that the mods of /r/news wanted to ensure people didn't see lest they possibly have a thought of their own:

&gt;He's a Democrat connected to Kamala Harris and Obama, and the prosecutor is best buddies with both of those people.

&gt;As usual, the left is above the law and can commit crimes with impunity.

_

&gt;The judge (that previously recused herself) is good friends with Smallet, Booker, and Kamala harris.

_

&gt;basically if the president can get away with it, why cant the rest of them

_

&gt;Prosecutor equated the result of prosecuting would likely result in community service and since he has done community service in his past he is off the legal hook. 16 federal indictments = likely community service...

_

&gt;My bet is that he was coordinating with Kamala Harris and Cory Booker and that this whole charade was to give their anti-lynching bill some momentum.

_

&gt;At least his name is mud and he destroyed his career.

_

&gt;I am simply amazed. Then again, I am not. The legal system for conservatives vs. liberals is like night and day. This should cause outrage. The same outrage that Jussie was trying to falsely gin up.

_

&gt;#boycottempire

_

&gt;Because he is famous black gay actor. If it was you or me, then our asses would've been in jail so fast, our anus would become a tear in time-space continuum.
