    <div class="md">No doubt that the coronavirus originated from wild animals and spread to humans in Wuhan, but I'd be pretty shocked if it had come out of a lab studying the virus. Even in China, these top epidemiologists would understand the importance of quarantine and preventing animal to human transmission. For the virus to have originated from a wet market, with live animals slaughtered, prepared, and eaten in the same area, seems much more plausible. Those markets are a hotbed of disease, including SARS, and are operated by people who could not care less about emergent zoonotic diseases.</div>

I was thinking the same thing. It does seem more likely to have come from someone eating a bat that they bought from the wet market. However, it is odd that the epidemiologist's info has been removed from the website.</div>

    <div class="md">There are plenty of other explanations of why China could be hiding this person. For example, they may have been vocal about the disease against censorship rulings, or critical of the government's response.

It's also worth noting that it seems unlikely that the virus was transmitted directly from bats to humans. This is the third major coronavirus outbreak, following SARS and MERS. SARS was spread from horseshoe bats to civets, then from civets to humans. MERS spread from Egyptian tomb bats to camels, then from camels to humans. Especially considering the occurrence of the disease in trafficked animals like pangolins, it seems highly likely that the disease came through another animal more closely related to humans.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean there is a huge difference between the education levels of the working class and the countries leading scientists, who are often foreign-educated. Universities throughout Europe, Australia, and the US are typically filled with wealthy Chinese nationals. This video even says that this is the team that identified the bat colony that SARS came from. I'd imagine they have some understanding and experience in handling and quarantining bats safely. I'm no supporter of China but its really not fair to compare the leading epidemiologists and biologists to any random bozo that happens to run a factory or a steel mill.</div>

    <div class="md">Whether or not this disease came from a wet market or a virus lab is moot.

It came from China. It originated in China. It's a Chinese virus. They covered up the existence of it early, and covered up the spread. They are complicit in the spreading of the virus. That's bad enough, and they need to pay for that.

At this point, I really don't give a shit where the Chinese virus came from specifically. I'm interested in how the world is going to make China take responsibility for this.</div>

The world needs to know, exactly, how it originated. If it came from a wet market, that would provide more proof that these markets need to be shut down.

Everybody needs to stop buying cheap plastic shit that they don't need from China, that is how.</div>

    <div class="md">The wet markets need to be shut down *regardless*. They've already been the birthing place of many very similar diseases in the past.

Absolutely. However, as long as GDP is seen as the sole determining factor for how the nation is progressing along versus it's neighbors (or anything else), it won't ever happen.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; The world needs to know, exactly, how it originated.

We know.  Here's a ~~video explaining which researchers in which lab~~

uh.. nevermind.  The video and the entire channel got deleted from Bitchute.  

Video was from a guy living in China who showed publicly available records (in chinese) detailing the research of a particular scientist studying bat diseases.  This started  many months beforehand so it wasn't a secret or anything to cover up.  Eventually the people in her lab were under self-imposed quarantine because they got infected.  Lots of documents later, we find out the original scientist is "missing" and she's been scrubbed from publicly available employee lists.   

The original source was quite clear.  How did it break out?  Since that "wet market" was only 850 feet away from the lab the speculation is that one of the lab workers went out for lunch and coughed on some fellow shoppers, before they started the self quarantine.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok this is weird.  When I originally came to this post 3 days ago and my made original comment there was a completely different video that played.  The first two minutes was some basement dweller talking about how communism is bad so I didn't bother with the rest.  

Now it's linking to the video I watched (on Bitchute) 2 days ago that was so good I grabbed a copy.  But it's still up on Youtube after 4 days so I guess it's not being removed after all!</div>

IT takes less than 2 minutes to find 'acceptable' political statements are allowed.  Those being any "orange man bad" posts or mocking anything right of Stalin.
