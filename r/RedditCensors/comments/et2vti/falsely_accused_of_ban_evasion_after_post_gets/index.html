    <div class="md">No you idiot i didn't get banned from /r/subredditcancer 

Also 支那 is NOT racist it is China's proper name.  中国 is the racist one implying that China is the center of the world

A Tang Dynasty (618–907) poem titled Ti Fan Shu (literally "preface to a Sanskrit book") by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang uses the Chinese term Zhīnà (支那) to refer to China.

Of course you don't know that because you are a racist brainwashed piece of shit.  Go cry to a pic of winnie you worthless moron.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;*Never believe that racists are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The racists have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.” ~ paraphrased from Jean Paul-Sartre.*

    <div class="md">Right but you started off with "urrr he's a racist" and didn't even mention mention that they are a liar.

When a stronger argument would be "this person has a history of making stuff up".

No one cares if they're a racist. It's highly irrelevant. What is relevant making stuff up.  


Start with your strongest argument dude.</div>

I stated the fact he’s a serial ban dodger, in response to his claim that he isn’t in the title (i.e. proving he’s a liar). He’s also a vile racist.

    <div class="md">Basic pattern recognition.

1 He goes to the same subs as his last 26 alts: /r/bestof, /r/worstof, /r/chinareddits, /r/subredditcancer, /r/todayilearned, /r/unpopularopinion, /r/jobs, /r/theoryofreddit, /r/pics etc.

2 He post in the same time zone as his last 26 alts.

3 His submissions are titled in the same format, complaining about being "censored" for breaking other subreddit rules:

https://np.reddit.com/r/chinareddits/comments/epz2ea/despite_evidence_to_the_contrary_rtheoryofreddit/

https://np.reddit.com/r/chinareddits/comments/avmwqf/yet_another_model_redditor_falls_victim_to/

https://removeddit.com/r/chinareddits/comments/c0hnob/banned_from_rlifeprotips_for_mentioning_taiwan/

4 On every single alt account he claims this is his only account, "but even if it isn't then it's still censorship". He has made this excuse on almost every single one of his alt accounts.

5 Whenever he gets called out, he makes link posts on other subreddits (like this one and /r/subredditcancer) about how he's being unfairly persecuted by downvote brigades/chinese shills etc.:

https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/awrzix/rchinareddits_originally_a_subreddit_for/

https://np.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/etz58n/downvote_brigaded_in_rchinareddits_a_subreddit/

6  He makes up the same persecuted backstories: claims to be Chinese/Taiwanese/Jewish/Asian/woman, LGBT, Antifa, whatever allows him some leeway to engage in racist dog-whistling.

7 He farms karma in the same way, posting hundreds of anti-Trump articles on /r/politics, /r/worldnews for easy karma, before spreading his filth that resulted in his past 26 accounts being admin-banned. He claims that his "karma" makes him immune to being racist, and that anyone banning him from whatever sub is actually working for the Chinese government. Most of his accounts are less than a month old with 15k or more karma.</div>

    <div class="md">1. This are all subreddits from the r/all which mean all redditors go there except maybe r/chinareddit but china is a big country so why not. 

2. This is what is called circumstantial evidence. We can go with that as far as we treat it accordingly. 

3. How "Banned from /r/LifeProTips for mentioning Taiwan" title has the same format as "Despite evidence to the contrary /r/TheoryOfReddit moderators deny pro-China censorship on reddit, then lock the thread". The only thing that links them is alleged anti china rethoric. 

4. Multiple accounts per se isn't violation of any rule so it's a fair point and the only way to fight any censorship. Still can we see where he claimed it in this account?

5. I don't see how this proves anything. Why wouldn't you complain about being censorshiped?

6. Or maybe you just targeting a persecuted ones. I fail to see how this add weight as no sane person will look it up. 

7. Tons of angry idiots post anti-trump stuff and some farm karma with doggos. So?

8. Can we at last see what a "filth" rasist stuff u/The_Gramscian spread?

To sum up: you have a time zone and anti China rethoric for justification – that's exactly what a Chinese censors would rely on.</div>

    <div class="md">Defend the racist all you like, the end result is that you can expect /u/The_Gramscian account to be suspended by reddit admins, repeatedly banned in multiple subreddit mods for ban evasion, and his 28th account active shortly after like he's been doing for the last 7 years.

In fact, we can make a small bet on it, if you like.

&gt;*The only thing that links them is alleged anti china rethoric.*

The common link is that every single thread where he claims he's being persecuted, is actually due to him breaking subreddit rules and there's no such "Chinese censorship" involvement. In fact, you can see multiple anti-CCP threads active every day on all those subreddits he submits his content to that suffers no such censorship. He's well aware of this, because being banned for legitimate reasons then making up bullshit is also a pattern.

    <div class="md">You call him racist with no prove to it. 

Ban evasion is against rules. Having multiple accounts isn't. 

People constantly complain on legit ban as a censorship. This isn't unique to this particular user. What your first two links has to prove anyway?

&gt; Here you go:

The first link leads to:
"Explain how that is racism wumao also I cannot be racist against chinese people becasue I am Chinese muyself.

我不可以做对种族主义反支那人，因为我是支那人自己。"

Maybe there is something racist written in Chinese otherwise it's clear. 

The second lead to some gibberish mumbles of a Marxist pig Jean Paul-Sartre... cited by you. Apperently all the fuss in the second thread is about word Zhīnà (支那) (which is obviously where the word China rooted). And apperently this word became derogatory due to it's use by Japanese who walked all over China too many times. So we can draw a conclusion that this term is mostly used by Japanese to insult Chinese. So by no stretch this can be attributed as racist as both nations are the same race. 

We can say some nationalism is at place here. Given the current Chinese encroachment on Hong Kong I'd bet this one is a hongkonger. On the bright side hongkonger calling himself Chinese is something to celebrate in China.

On the other hand we know you are very pro China and anti HongKong and the fact that you chasing people on this subject for 7 years is telling.

Even if you could convince us that this is not yet another angry hongkonger unhappy with Chinese abuse of human rights but the same person you'll still will be on the wrong side of history.</div>

He's being banned for ban evasion. Having multiple accounts is the pre-condition for ban evasion.

I gave you proof of him using the equivalent of calling black people the n-word and still you claim there's no proof of him being a racist. If you have no intent to be convinced by facts or evidence and want to remain disingenuous, then just say so.

Zhina isn't that equivalent. It maybe an ethnic slur (never heard it before) but not racial.

The only reason you use word racist is the same reason all lefties use it – to shut down people with opinions you don't like.

    <div class="md">&gt;*It maybe an ethnic slur (never heard it before) but not racial.*

It was a term used by Japanese war criminals to dehumanize Chinese people back in WW2, and carries negative historical connotations the same way the word “negro” is no longer acceptable to refer to a black person. The slur is STILL used today by Japanese alt-right racists like Ishihara Shintaro when referring to Chinese or Ryukyuans. It’s also used by masked bigots in HK to dehumanize mainlanders just like the Japanese soldiers who once committed mass atrocities against HK locals.

I’m telling you that your guesses are the opposite of reality. He’s a mentally ill person who literally called for the genocide of Chinese people in one of his alts. I am an actual HKer.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; war criminals to dehumanize Chinese people

Well I've read the wiki page you've attached. It wasn't that dramatic. It was an ordinary way to call Chinese which through the corse of several Sin-Japanese conflicts gained negative connotation due to Japanese contempt toward Chinese. Basicly it's like if i hypothetically would call you Rice_22 as a synonym of a gready communist pig and then you pout as you feel offended... by your own name. 

As you may rightfully compare this term to a word "negro" I can't get what is your complain. As a matter of fact word negro is used in us census as "some older black Americans still self-identify with the term". 

&gt; literally called for the genocide of Chinese people 

Through out the history Chinese people had accomplished it very much by themselves. Mao's great leap "forward" that claimed 30 mil lives at least just after genocidle "cultural" revolution would be a very good example. There is definetly no help needed.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;*I didn't say it's okay. I said it's not racist and it's not subjective.*

Now you are claiming to be an objective arbitrator on what is racist or not, lol.

Look, even the Japanese have defined the word as a racist ethnic slur and should not be used in polite conversation.

&gt;&gt;The entry for shina (支那) in the Kanjigen reads in part as follows: 「中国のこと。昔、中国の仏教徒が、仏典を漢訳するときに、インドでの中国の名称を音訳したもの。元来外国人が中国を呼ぶときに用いてきたもの。現代は、蔑称に近いとして使用しない。「至那」「脂那」とも書く。「震旦シンタン」ともいう。▽Ｃｈｉｎａ（英語・ドイツ語）・Ｃｈｉｎｅ（フランス語）などと同じく、語源は秦シンだといわれているが、異説もある。

&gt;&gt;Translation by Japanese speaker: "[Meaning:] China. In ancient times, when Chinese Buddhists translated the Buddhist sutras into Chinese, they used the transliteration [i.e., the transcription of the sound] of the word used in India for China. Originally, it was the word used by foreigners to refer to China. In modern times [gendai - i.e., after WWII] , it is close to being derogatory and is therefore not used."

The ROC under Chiang Kaishek also told Japan to stop using the word. The only people who still use the word in Japan today are alt-right racists like Ishihara Shintaro.

&gt;*how did you spotted him?*

When someone does the same thing over 27 times you kind of recognize his habits and posting pattern. I knew this guy since he was /u/Kannanet about 7 years ago.

But hey, here’s more evidence of his racist dog-whistling:

    <div class="md">Well words have meaning you know and it's not China who define them. I'm not arguing for the use of this term just that it isn't racist. 

The Japanese haven't defined the word as a racist ethnic slur. According to your own translation they defined it as "close to being derogatory". Well Japanese is a very polite nation I'd say. 

About your links:

1 isn't dragon one of [China's symbols] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_China) so I guess you can't claim depicting china as a dragon is racist. Isn't it's part of cousine in some parts of china to consume variety of creatures like [cats and snakes] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_tiger_phoenix) or rats and insects? So depicting it as a part of Chinese culture can't be even derogatory. Let alone some crazy stuff with traditional medicine and superstitious believes in the country. So how come stating the fact is racist? Whould you consider an obese Uncle Sam munching burgers racist too?

2 it's quite an obvious truth just like two whites can't make a Chinese baby. I can agree it probably had an intent to be derogatory (idk maybe Wong is a slur) but just like it failed to be a joke it failed to be racist but ended as a poor taste. 

3 how "fuck china" is racist? It is a political statement and even isn't targeted on Chinese people only on the country. 

Once again Chinese is not a race.

I didn't ask how you matched patterns. I asked for what reason you've checked hundreds of comments in that thread? Do you regularly do that to all threads in that sub or you target only threads with a specific topics?</div>

Oh, you’re one of *those* people. I’m going to take your logic and apply it to other ethnicities so you have a better clue what your logic leads to.

Blacks are not a race because there are Tutsi, Hutu, Twa etc. so the people behind the genocide of each side in Rwanda isn’t racist.

Jews are not a singular race because there are Ashkenazi Jews and Sephardi Jews so you can’t be racist against Israeli Jews.

Calling all white people warmongering sister-fuckers or all Indians dirty rapists based on the behaviour of a non-representative tiny subset of the population is not racist because it’s “factual” (not at all).

At this point you’re desperately scrambling to defend an obvious racist. It’s not a good look, buddy.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh, you’re completely out of the loop and just putting words in my mouth.

&gt; Blacks are not a race because 

There was no because in what I've said. Black is a race. 

Genocides on the other hand are almost never race related. They happen between the nations who are related or even within one nation – like cultural revolution genocide. 

Rwanda genocide wasn't racist as "people behind" it were... Tutsi and Hutu who killed each other. You can hate Tutsi and be okay with blacks in general. This doesn't make you a racist. It makes you a nationalist or maybe a bigot. So calling Rwanda genocide racist is like calling Tiananmen, Yunnan or Daoxian massacres were racist. 

Chinese has tons of prejudices toward Japanese but this doesn't make them racist just nationalist – you know the one that CCP is so eager to raise. There is a word for this – Nipponophobia. 

&gt; Jews are not a singular race 

Jew is not a race at all. It's a nation just like Arab and Chinese. National socialist persecuted Jews – maybe that will give you a clue on distinction between nationalism and racism. 

As a matter of fact Jews invented a special term for their persecution – anti-semitism. Despite the fact that semite isn't a synonym for a Jew and include arabs and some extinct nations somehow it sticked.  

&gt; Calling all white people warmongering sister-fuckers or all Indians dirty rapists 

The former is racist because white is a race just like black. The latter maybe nationalistic, chauvinistic or xenophobic depending on the context because Indian is a nation. 

Because you know... word has meaning and their main purpose is to convey that meaning. 

I guess you are too lazy and/or stupid (I'll give you benefit of a doubt) to look up a definition of a racist so here you go:

&gt; racist /ˈreɪsɪst/ noun
a person who shows or feels discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or who believes that a particular race is superior to another.

Racism is just like communism it oversimplifies your world view and lead to false conclusions. 

To be racist you have to simultaneous meet two criteria: show prejudice and base it exclusively on one's race (not nation). 

Notice you don't have to be an outsider to be racist. White socialist are predominantly racist because they show prejudice toward white solely on the basis of race. 

But you can't be racist to Chinese if you target them exclusively as Chinese and not as Asian. It doesn't makes it okay nor it makes it racist. 

On the other hand following your logic you should see [this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harry_R._Hopps,_Destroy_this_mad_brute_Enlist_-_U.S._Army,_03216u_edit.jpg) or [this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lindsay_German_monster.jpg) as racist towards white people which makes no sense. It was made by white people and was targeted exclusively toward Germans. As a matter of fact there is a special word for this too – germanophobia. 

What is obvious to me is that many nations China have walked all over (like Taiwan, HK, Tibet, etc.) hate China just like Chinese hate Japan. What is also obvious is that this hate doesn't make all them racist. Guess it's all have more to do with historical context rather than bigotry.

By the way you didn't answer why you dig through tons comments in order to target specific type of people. As it seems like you've spend a lot of time on this hunt for the past 7 years as if it was your day job.</div>

You are arguing inane bullshit arguments because you are stuck defending an obvious racist. You somehow claim genocide, i.e. action to destroy a group of people, is not racist, which is judging people based on their ethnic group.

The double hypocrisy is when you arbitrarily claim some groups are races and some are not (blacks &amp; whites despite them being a skin colour), and that somehow you cannot be racist against groups that are both ethnicities and nationalities (see: Indians, Chinese). Then you claim because you defined them as not-race groups then it’s okay to be racist against them.

You argue the “meaning of words” because you can not attack the main point of the arguments, you try to inject as much subjective silliness into this because you cannot provide objective information to support your position.</div>

    <div class="md">See? You did it again. Gish gallop means to overwhelm opponent with as many arguments as possible. I was making one argument over and over again and just followed your lead. Lefties always try to redefine words because objective reality that words describe never fit your fantasy world. 

Judging people based on their ETHNICITY is called xenophobic not racist by definition of... racism. You are just arbitrary use this term to serve you needs. 

There are three categories: race – based in biology, nation – in political geography and ethnicity – in culture. All are deeply intertwined but very distinct. They are not arbitrary. Some assholes claim this are social constructs but good luck to construct a white Japanese out of a Nigerian – this doesn't even have a meaning. 

One can be Asian (race), Chinese (geography) and Han (culture). You can be racist to asians and xenophobic to Chinese and Han. Both are not civil. 

By the way china and Chinese are two different things. 

Tell me how you feel about great Japanese culture and their ethnic values that made them so great? Does those feelings make you a racist?

And still you refuse to answer why you target people online.

    <div class="md">I’m glad you know what Gish Gallop means, although it would be better if you have some self-reflection to realize when you engage in it.

The main point of my argument is the OP is a bullshit spewing racist troll. You try to defend him by keep trying to redefine the meaning of common terms with your subjective opinions, claim ethnic slurs are not racist because you said so, claim “Chinese isn’t a race” because you can’t get it in your head that there are groups that stretches over both race and nationality, and keep trying to derail this into inane bullshit by trying to make this about me as a person.

Yes words have meaning, but they’re also not fixed in stone. There’s something called context. There is no additional information gained when you tried to separate xenophobic with racist in this context, they equate the same thing.

PS: The OP now claims he can’t be racist because he’s a “liberal” and “Chinese” after he got caught making shit up to slander Chinese tourists.

    <div class="md">The one who is trying to redefine words is you. There was nothing arbitrary in my words. 

I can get my head around that there are groups that stretches over race and nationality (the core base of ethnicity) but if there is no China there is no Chinese and it has nothing to do with race. 

My main point was you should use correct word regardless of OP's personality. The only reason you refuse to use xenophobic is because it's not that politically charged. 

The only one who attacks people based on their personality is you as there was nothing racist in the OP's post you've taken down purely out your political prejudges. 

The examples may be deemed as personal are only there to call out your hypocrisy and racism bullshit.</div>

Counterpoint: Chinese Americans.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Americans

&gt;***The Chinese American community comprises the largest ethnic group of Asian Americans, comprising 25.9% of the Asian American population as of 2010.***

According to the US definition of ethnic groups, "Chinese" is an ethnic group. Doesn't matter if you're not born in China or not.

So, the one trying to redefine already established terms is you. The one who wanted to claim that "you can't be racist against Chinese because Chinese isn't a race" is because you want to downplay what the OP did. And even now you claim an obvious racist is "nothing racist". Oh look, he's still being racist.

    <div class="md">You are completely of the point. Chinese is an ethnic group (not a race) and you don't have to be born in china to be a Chinese. But the point was that when china will be gone within a century or so there will be no Chinese left. Just like there were no Chinese before china emerged and no romans left since the Roman Empire is gone. 

&gt; Oh look, he's still being racist.

Apparently [this one] (https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590969af2179605b11ad69b8/master/w_900,c_limit/101108_r20184_p886.jpg) and [this one] (https://grrrgraphics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/xi_china_nba_cartoon.jpg) are too. I guess [this one] (https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztjvs4eIA3DqPoA/source.gif) should be extra racist then. 

You are probably one of those who called Charlie Hebdo racist and the attack on them "a well deserved retaliation". 

Isn't it's China communist party's fault we have a pandemic on a rise?</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;*Chinese is an ethnic group (not a race) and you don't have to be born in china to be a Chinese.*

So they are an ethnicity (ethnic group) but somehow not a "race"? What is even your definition of a "race"? And you admit that Chinese is both a nationality as well as an ethnic group, meaning all your excuses above about how you "can't be racist against Chinese people" is rubbish.

&gt;*I guess this one should be extra racist then.*

Yes, that South Park gif is racist. And no, I don't support terrorist attacks just like I don't support racists. Most terrorists are also racists/xenophobes.

Do you blame the Spanish for the Spanish flu too? (PS: it started in France)</div>

    <div class="md">Can you provide evidence that those accounts were run by the same person and this same person is /u/The_Gramscian. 

And please bother to explain what is extremely rasist in citing the guardian?

&gt; It's not worth taking the words of a racist troll at face value, you know.

I know that if you judge words base on the character of the speaker and not on the substance of those words you are just a fool and a bigot.</div>
