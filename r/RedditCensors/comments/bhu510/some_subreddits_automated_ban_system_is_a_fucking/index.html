Some subreddits have way to anal automated ban systems. This time, I'm talking specifically about r/AskWomen but plenty of subs make making a post on the sub a fucking challenge.

Before I make a post on a sub, I do a quick check of rules and then make the post. And then usually it will get automatically removed by some stupid rule. This time, trying to post on askwomen, it gets removed first time. OK, so I reword the title and try to post it again (had to wait 10 minutes). It gets removed again. Another 10 minutes. I post again and it gets removed again. So now I've given up on trying to post (it was on a throwaway otherwise i'd get screenshots- it was a sex question and some of my friends know this account and I didnt want to chance them seeing that) 

&amp;#x200B;

This happens way to often in way to many subreddits- it shouldn't be a fucking challenge to make a post, just because it's getting flagged by the title.</div>

    <div class="md">Usually due to mods not wanting to get flooded with certain kinds of questions or posts.


Luckily there are usually 'True' or 'Unlimited' versions of subreddits where the rules are a bit looser.


Have to admit I wish I could find a sub where mods tell the horror stories that got them to set the rules they do.. not that I need to see the usernames for my block list but I'm betting some of them would be entertaining in a 'Oh, so _that's_ what sealioning looks like!' sort of way.</div>
