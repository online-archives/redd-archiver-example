    <div class="md">That's not what I said, but let's tackle that point regardless.

Yes, to label all police officers as corrupt pieces of shit like those involved in George Floyd's murder would be hypocritical. There are plenty of officers who stand with the protestors, plenty who have spoken against the actions taken that day. The majority of the police force are just men and women doing their jobs, keeping the peace and trying to help their communities.

However, we need to acknowledge that this isn't an isolated incident. There have been a shit ton of other incidents of police brutality and murder of innocent lives over the decades, most of which are dealt with far lighter sentences than what you'd expect from their crimes when compared to the same crimes committed by non-police, and some of which have gotten off scott free. Most of these crimes have been committed against minorities, especially blacks and Latinos. Not only that, but also consider that Chauvin wasn't arrested for his crimes until after the protests started, even though there was explicit video evidence of what happened. 

In addition, let's also consider the amount of videos of police brutality in the recent days during the protests, where unarmed citizens have been arrested, beaten and permanently injured by police officers, from protesters and news media, to regular people caught in the crossfire. This is clearly a structural problem within the police force, especially when officers are committing crimes and being protected from persecution.

Not all officers are to be blamed, as we have seen in some videos, but that doesn't mean the system isn't corrupt. People aren't protesting because a black man was killed. They are protesting because of the years of injustices that the public has been given from these corrupt officers being protected. George Floyd's murder was just the straw that broke the camel's back.</div>

    <div class="md">So in order to understand the situation, if you start from the very beginning in like the early 1900's, no question there was systemic injustice and racism, and then over time the laws were changed and now if we look at purely from a legal standpoint, there are zero laws which discriminate against minorities by the color of their skin. So from a legal point, the system itself is NOT racist anymore. As to the real point though: are there enforcers of this legal system who ARE racist and unfairly making it a stronger point to enforce the law against certain groups of people? The unfortunate answer to that is yes. And when that happens, do we also have a corrupt police/local government system which tries to hide/cover up these situations so as to avoid all the controversy when such a situation is exposed? The unfortunate answer to that is also yes.

But these situations aren't a reflection on the system itself. It's a reflection of corruption that exists both in the low level enforcers of the law (cops), as well as a reflection of their higher ups who protect them from their actions (not necessarily because they're also racist, but because they want to cover up and prevent controversy). So what's the solution to this problem? Unfortunately there isn't some quick fix, but I believe that we already have been doing A LOT to try to expose these situations when they happen and make sure the people responsible are punished. For example we have been trying to push for less lethal law enforcement with tasers. We have made a strong push for body cams to make sure that what cops do don't happen in secret. We allow for cops to be recorded and try to expose these situations when they happen.

If these protesters have suggestions for further improvements to the system, they should be offering those, not causing mindless senseless violence in response to something everyone agrees was wrong. To just suggest the system is racist and incite violence trying to burn it down solves NOTHING. It only makes the problem worse. Then if you add in the looters that makes it way worse. The looters basically validate what the racist people think instead of prove them wrong.</div>

    <div class="md">Exactly. That's why there is the distinction between those who are protesting, and those who are going out stealing and vandalising from local businesses and the like. Hell, we have seen some of these rioters and looters being combatted against by those who are simply protesting and don't want there to be violence. It adds nothing and only exists to damage their movement, and I'm not even gonna go into the whole police officers and white supremacists disgusing themselves as protesters and shit. 

The laws that govern the US aren't broken, but those with the power to dictate them are. That's why it's a systemic problem. In a perfect world, all would be held to the same scrutiny, but reality isn't that fair. That's why situations like this can crop up and be mishandled by those who dish out the law, and those who judge. It isn't the laws that need to change, but the police force. There needs to be a reform, and they should be held to the same level of accountability as the public, if not, worse, as they are meant to uphold the law. 

How we do that, I don't know, but the protests are better at getting things moving over sitting on our asses and expecting things to change. Social and legal reform doesn't happen if the people don't stand up to injustice. It's worked before, and it'll work again, so long as the people don't exist within some authoritarian society.</div>

    <div class="md">Except that when people OBVIOUSLY speak out against the actual bad ones, the violent thugs who are looters or burning police stations, the media conveniently does a blanket defense grouping them in with the peaceful protesters as if people are racist for speaking against either of them. That's the problem. You say that the protesters and the rioters/looters are two different groups, well if that's true, then don't separate them when it's convenient for you but keep them grouped when people hate their actions.

The obvious example of this is that Antifa literally is a terrorist organization and Trump was right to declare them as such. However, the media defends Antifa even though they are a group responsible for inciting the violent protests, rioting/looting. They group Antifa in with the peaceful protesters in such a way where apparently it's a problem to speak bad against Antifa as if you're speaking against the peaceful protesters.</div>

    <div class="md">But that's what I mean. I've never grouped protesters with looters. Some people refuse to separate the two because, for some retarded fucking reason, they have the mindset of "with us or against us", as if there are only two sides in this situation. All the looters are doing is giving the police and the media a reason to treat these protests as little more than a means to commit felonies, instead of what they actually are. 

Whether it be Antifa, undercover cops, white supremacists or just thugs, they're pieces of shit, and them attacking cops and pedestrians, destroying property and instigating riots are ruining what these protests are about.</div>

    <div class="md">When the protestors simply let the looters do whatever they want, they are not being responsible citizens.

Read up on Martin Luther King's marches.  His people stopped rioters, looters, violent individuals in most cases before the cops needed to step in.

Of course, the Left has no large name individual actively leading them, only hidden people funding them.</div>

    <div class="md">Except the protesters *are* stopping them. There are plenty of videos of looters and rioters being stopped or called out by protesters. The problem is you can't identify a looter or rioter from a protestor until they've already started shit, and by that point, the damage is likely already done.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;There are plenty of videos of looters and rioters being stopped or called out by protesters     

And you can say the same thing about the cops.  There are plenty of good cops too, and they take a stand against racist behavior and police brutality.  I got downvoted in another thread for saying that demanding that the cops "police their own" while doing nothing about the agitators within their own ranks is full-blown hypocrisy.  There *are* examples of protesters calling out bad actors, just as there *are* examples of the cops doing the same.  Hell, the cop who started all of this was fired and has been charged with murder!  What more do people want?

&gt;The problem is you can't identify a looter or rioter from a protestor until they've already started shit     

Again, you can say the same about the cops.  However, I understand people's frustration when you find out that Dumbfuck Cop who started all of this had plenty of complaints against him.  He should have been fired long ago.  As others in this thread have pointed out, this isn't about racism, it's about corruption.</div>

    <div class="md">Every now and then, the protestors stop the rioters, sure.  It happens, but it does not happen reliably and often.  Seriously.  Look at the history of the MLK marches and demonstrations.  They were enormous, and the number of burned out cars and buildings was nearly zero.  It might have actually been zero, but I'm having vague memories that some of MLK's early marches were also attended by Black Panthers, who were much more willing to do violence.

The current protests by the Left are disgusting and are generating zero sympathy from the undecided voters and fence-sitters.</div>
