Here's the link to the removed post:

Update! I've been given the "reason" as:

"Link dumping / agenda account"

I'm not sure what link dumping is, and what is an agenda account? An account of someone who has an opinion? I think that's everyone, right?

    <div class="md">Well yes of course. Reality is far more complicated and the truth may not always reflect one's beliefs. Instead of analyzing things criticially these types of people find it easier to turn a blind eye or to demonize anything that doesnt fit their narrative, that way they don't have to come up with real life solutions to real life problems and they don't have to look inward at their own faults or complacency. So much easier to just scape goat a boogy man by dismissing everything they don't like as white supremacy or alt right and then think that you're somehow superior to the masses because you're so woke. Fucking clown world indeed.</div>

    <div class="md">Change can be bad though. No matter how good ones intentions not taking into account how you want to change things and what that means for people is shortsighted and dumb.

    <div class="md">Same to you though. You only think you know better. Getting to the right or more correct answer is the best we can do though. Maybe accepting the knowledge of those we know to be more educated than ourselves isnt a bad thing though. After all we are paying to learn and if what we are learning gleams truth in the real world what is wrong with applying what we know? Change happens whether you want iot or not and is a losing battle trying to make that not the case. Our society, culture, and politics are all evolving and growing. Our policies need to change with it or else we would still have policy that today we see as obvious or a given. If our government hadnt changed with the growing of culture then we would still live in a monarch world. We wouldn't even have the United States of America. If we hadn't changed when we became United States of America we would still have slavery. I could keep typing more examples but I hope you can see how change was immensely good overall. Change is how we more appropriately align our laws with the ideals of the people they are in place for.

&amp;#x200B;

We need change and pretending that what we have is good or good enough is simply incorrect. Growing and becoming more is what is needed and this includes tackling all the topics you think you already have an answer for.</div>

    <div class="md">You're right, change is necessary and inevitable but ensuring we do it right means that we have to allow platforms for all people who might be affected by such change. Blindly folowing what some people spew without taking into consideration all the other views is how we move closer to authoritarianism and I, for one, dont want to see that happen any more than it already is and will challenge this wherever I see it.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes and I have taken the time to actually look at my own beliefs in this matter and can easily side with the one that watns progress. At this point I sincerely dont know what most republicans are even defending regarding most political policies. I sincerely dont know what they think there is to defend in trump or hate about in regards to more left leaning ideologues. I have no clue what we are defending privatized medicine for, no clue why we are defending privatized prisons, schooling, college....ect. These things clearly could be working much better and there a lot of examples for most of these topics and yet republicans flip when we talk about taxing the super rich as if trickle down economics was magically working for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because a group of people disagrees doesn't mean you can just assume they are simply brainwashed and arent actually thinking. If that is the case then you are the authoritarian thinking we need to live how you say.

&amp;#x200B;

What is happening now in politics is horrid. We are all Americans and should be on each others sides and instead we are arguing whether or not rich people deserve to hold all of the money we helped them get. We argue about what truth is and sit on our positions as if we already had truth to begin with. Evidence of crime isn't enough for anyone anymore on almost all fronts. Whether the evidence clearly indicates a president is doing illegal things, whether the planet is hot, cold, flat or round. Whether vaccines are liquid autism or any of the other asinine things that is now a point to argue.

&amp;#x200B;

Some things just are what they are and other things will never be a perfect or solid truth. All of us understanding our general motivations and wishes might be a good starting point to as to where to begin finding the truth that we all have to make as a society. Rather than immediately side with republican or democrats. There is a severe lack of actual  critical thinking and just as much practice of people barricading themselves into views that they themselves dont understand why they keep.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of your Opposition isnt blind at all. Some of the people who have these beliefs take the time to understand them. I can not say I see this from a vast majority of trump supporters. Honestly I can't, all shit talk aside I regularly see trump supporters continuously quote platitudes or out right incorrect information. I have yet to see one valid reason for sticking up for trump and that right there is why so many people disagree with you on reddit. An internet based semi democratic system that allows for the complete freedom of speech. HOWEVER freedom of speech doesnt mean "well most people are talking this way so they are all brain washed" isnt you doing your due diligence. A huge portion of the public dont even need news to let us know how to feel. I say this as one of them sense I dont own cable and dont watch news programs. So I have to read and watch trump myself. The picture he paints for me is one that I wish no one has to deal with but that isnt reality and I have to be part of the voice against what I see to be wrong morally, ethically, and lawfully. At this point if you have read this far and you see my last paragraph and want to write me off as brainwashed then it really was fruitless typing any of this because someone elses position isnt something you actually care about. You just want any position that doesn't agree with yours to be closer to your own. You dont want to grow at that point you just want things to be easy and not work on changing your deeply held beliefs.</div>

    <div class="md">I actually do want to hear opposing views, which is why I post in subs that are in opposition to what I believe. These kinds of conversations are important imo so I welcome them. If you can't understand where Trump supporters are xoming from I feel that you're only ingesting the news that fits your bias already. I was vehemently against Trump in the begining and I fell for all the negative shit that the MSM is pushing (btw, you don't have to watch TV to be affected by that, there is so much lazy and biased reporting everywhere that it's hard to get to the truth of the matter). If you don't understand where the critism for things like universal healthcare is coming from then you are not really listening to what Trump supporters and the like are saying. If you see Trump as some sort of criminal then youre not paying attention and its not my job to educate you. All I can say is, really think about what the world would look like if you can get all these changes that you so blindly advocate from without listening to the actual people that these changes will affect. I wish you luck on your journey though and gods bless you.</div>

    <div class="md">You are lying no one who was against trump before is with him now. Jeez you people are sad. I literally said I do not watch cable news or tv and watch him and what he says and tweets and you still fucking think you can tell me my sources are bad. Fuck it is infuriating even attempting to give you the benefit of a doubt. Trump supporter have nothing NOTHING to add to any fucking conversation. Trump has done literally nothing good since being in office but I am wrong for thinking he is a moron. At what point is my observation of what trump is doing valid? Why is what my eyes see and hear TRUMP do not matter? I am not quoting a fucking news organization here. I am telling you based on what he has said, tweeted, acted, and done that I heavily dislike trump at all. No news there. No brainwashing. Just simple assessment after literally paying attention to DONALD TRUMP and not a fox (or literally any other) news anchor is telling me. I find his policies incredibly short sighted, his demeanor deserving of everyone's reproach, and his "leadership" utterly dismal.

&amp;#x200B;

And guess what? Unlike you I am able to say I didnt need a news anchor to come to that understanding. Unlike you I am not just accepting what I am being told to feel. I have every reason to dislike trump and am left with none to justify him in any manner.

&amp;#x200B;

You should actually try making up your own mind for once instead of projecting the situation you made for yourself on others.

&amp;#x200B;

fyi: I am blocking you now. I have no time to continually explain how someone is being exactly what they are saying is bad. Trump is an evil indiviual and one day will be completely understood in history as being an embarrassment to the country. That is your reality, no different than all the bigots and shitty ideologue people that came before you. You ARE on the wrong side of history. You are also a liar.

" I actually do want to hear opposing views, which is why I post in subs that are in opposition to what I believe. These kinds of conversations are important imo so I welcome them. If you can't understand where Trump supporters are xoming from I feel that you're only ingesting the news that fits your bias already. " you undermine your own self one sentence to the next.  

You are not smart or clever or above reproach. You are one more ignorant of a trump supporter that will live the rest of your life thinking his is a rad dude. You are a sad human and am done talking to you now and enjoy the idea that soon you will have to live with the fact the rest of fucking world is happy he isnt president, was impeached, and hopefully jailed. I take my wish of good luck back. You dont need luck you have the imaginary support of god and trump so.........</div>

&gt;ou are lying no one who was against trump before is with him now. 

Lol, well I'm not sure that I want to read anymore of your wall of text because this is indeed what happened to me and a lot of people I know.  Many people who supported Obama and Bernie and who were against Trump in the begining became Trump supporters. This right here is a reason why the dems will lose again in 2020, you people are completely tone deaf.


Well I just read the part where you say that Trump has done nothing for the country, which shows how absolutely brainwashed you are. How about the lowest unemployment rate in a long ass time, how about prison reform? Trump has done plenty of positive things, much more than his predecessor or Bush. But of course you think that you're somehow better because you don't watxh tv? I dont either, but I bet that you read the shitty opinion pieces that get passed off as news now and days. If you can't see the lies that are being crammed down your throat then I feel sorry for you.


Edit: oh and now I got to the part that says you're blocking me because you absolutely can't handle a civil discussion. Who is being shortsighted, who is falling into the trap of just believing whatever propanganda gets thrown at you. If you can read this, name me some policies of Trumps that you feel have detrimental to the country, I het you couldn't come up with anything because your hate of Trump only rests on his personality and not his actions or policies. You come off as a typical NPC and I'm sorry for you because when you grow up you will look back on this and cringe at your stupidity and complacency.</div>

The democrat party started using Correct the Record in 2015, the *reported* budget for ShareBlue in 2018 was $40 million.</div>

    <div class="md">Yea, I got banned around xmass when most of the other mods were away for vacation and some woke mod decided to remove anybody who had wrong think.  Pulled up some BS posts I made merely sharing my opinion on what I thought about trans and somehow they twisted as hate speech, which it wasn't, but whatever.  Didn't really matter to me, the mods were already removing any story and posts that did not fit an agenda, so I said screw it and have not been back since its just becoming another echo/shill chamber.</div>
