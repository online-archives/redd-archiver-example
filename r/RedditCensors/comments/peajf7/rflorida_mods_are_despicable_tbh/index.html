    <div class="md">This nonsense about "huge uptick in calls" was big for about 3 days, until it turned out there were only a handful of such calls, and none serious. 

Only 1 of them was advised to even go to the hospital.  

They tried this same crap when CNN &amp; Co was screeching "DRINK  BLEACH!" and trying to blame it on Trump, who never said any such thing. 

Turns out the fake news about "huge uptick in calls to poison control" was a complete lie back then too.</div>

    <div class="md">**Don't agree with your ban IDE RATHER PEOPLE SEE YOUR OPINION** but you sir are an idiot. FDA approval doesn't mean shit when the product isn't being used in the approved/intended way.

[Here is the FDA stance on why taking ivermectin is a bad idea.](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19)

Not to mention Ivermectin designed for animal use is much more accessible, than the version with a MUCH lower concentration for humans.

[Article on why the Human safe dosage of Ivermectin is insufficient of eliminating covid 19.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32378737/)

Ivermectin is not a cure, Its not even a viable treatment for covid, Like bleach it can kill covid in vitro in a lab, e.g. in a fuckin petri dish, not the human body with out killing you or doing irreversible damage to you bodies vital organs.</div>

    <div class="md">I know. Those people are idiots who can’t adjust a dose on top of taking a med that doesn’t even work. I’m just saying the OP was only stating the headline is misleading because it’s written as if ivermectin is not a medication used in humans. Writing “ivermectin, a medication used to treat parasites in cows and horses.” In that headline implies that the poisoning was caused by regular dose of ivermectin itself instead of by the massive overdose quantities of it that some idiots are taking. I’m saying OP is right. If the headline said “people taking horse sized dose of medication end up getting sick” it wouldn’t get the same amount of clicks because yeah, obviously they would get sick.</div>

    <div class="md">Off label drug use, in the USA, is nothing new. Thousands of doctors prescribe off label things that haven't been approved by the FDA.

What's more, the USA, and the FDA, aren't the only government sources in the world. Step out of your bubble for a bit. The USA is one country, there are hundreds of others, and they have approved drugs and treatment that the USA hasn't, usually for monetary reasons.

How did we go from hating our health care system in the USA, and believing it was just a bunch of greedy bastards, to trusting it whole heartedly?</div>
