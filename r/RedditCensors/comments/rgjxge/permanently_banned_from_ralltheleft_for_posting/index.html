      <div class="md">I posted this: https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/rfvp58/glenn_greenwald_since_the_end_of_ww2_vehement/, which has since been removed, along with a number of my comments within. I noticed earlier that they had already removed a post of mine from 2 days ago without explanation https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/resy7q/glenn_greenwald_by_far_the_greatest_amount_of/ they also removed my comment/reply in that thread as well it seems. Yet at the moment I am writing this, this post (https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/rfyvzf/glenn_greenwald_theres_apparently_a_shortage_of/) which was posted 18 hours ago and my last post there - is still up despite it being a Glenn Greenwald tweet. I received this is my mail:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/alltheleft. You can still view and subscribe to r/alltheleft, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;&gt;No posting of jimmy dore or glenn greenwald or any other right wing assholes on this sub unless to is to mock them. We went over this once before with you.

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/alltheleft by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

Of course now in addition to having had comments removed, I am unable to reply to this other user and defend myself against their bullshit accusations. The user I was talking to in that thread, never even posts to that subreddit, but has posted to Sam Harris. They question me when I question their smears. They ignore any evidence that conflicts with the narrative they are pushing. I say I am a leftist/progressive, because I am and this person says I am lib-right for posting Greenwald and Dore and a mark who has been scammed. It says right there in the rules No trolling and Disagree with ideas without making it personal, this person violated at least the latter and baited me into an argument and their comments stay up, but not mine. The person accused me of being a plant and shill, paid by Greendwald and or Dore to defend them. Mods can't even be consistent with enforcing rules and evenhanded with the censorship they employ. So it's more than them just banning people over posting figures they don't like/don't think are leftist, even if those figures themselves identify as leftist and or embrace leftist ideals. 

Anyways, I replied to the mod with:

&gt;First, not that I agreed with you before but you said don't post Jimmy Dore videos, the exact quote was: "ok this is getting nowhere. See you in 3 days. Post Dore's shit again on this sub-reddit in a way that positions himself as an ally to the working class and the ban will be permanent." I didn't post a Jimmy Dore video or article, I posted a Glenn Greenwald tweet. Second, Jimmy Dore is not a right-winger, neither is Glenn Greenwald. Dore is also pro-working class and unions in addition to being for progressive policy. Not sure why you ignore this when you screech about him being no friend to the left and working class. You also removed comments of mine in that thread and for what? The user that was engaging with me was engaging in equal or worse behavior (in addition to their initial ad hom rather than addressing Glenn's argument if they did not agree with it) yet you leave up their comments, while you remove mine? What the fuck is that all about? Seriously though, when the fuck did this sub become pro-censorship? Whichever mod is doing this is an absolute fucking scumbag of a person and the rest of you allowing this to happen are a fucking disgrace for allowing it to happen.

Oops, so that last bit is redundant, realizing that now after reading what I wrote. Again, I posted/contributed to this sub regularly and for over a year (not dozens, but hundreds of posts) and this is the thanks I get. I guess good luck with their authoritarian sub and parroting establishment dem/pro security state and military industrial complex smears and censoring leftist, I will just post content elsewhere and hopefully their community catches on to the mod abuse that is happening. Reminder that I posted both Greenwald and Dore stuff to r/alltheleft in the past without issue and Dore's videos (any videos) had to be manually approved by a mod and there were!

Edit: an hour after replying to their ban, I get:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/alltheleft. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/alltheleft for 28 days.

Edit: Previous thread for those interested https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/r479ow/temp_banned_from_ralltheleft_for_posting_jimmy/ and no, I wasn't trying to get banned here. The person I was speaking with in the thread was shit talking Greenwald and then added in Dore and I defended Greenwald and again they mentioned Dore. I mean the one comment where I mention Dore (I replied to this user who was saying GG and Dore are not leftist and they are grifters) and said he is a leftist, isn't even removed!
