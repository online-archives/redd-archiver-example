    <div class="md">Well to be fair... what else can the liberals do at this point?  

I mean have you really looked at the stats lately?  The democrats have been utterly destroyed.  The liberals have caused a massive rift within their party that prevents them from having a unified message America will accept.  They don't have a working platform, they don't have a message, they don't have real leaders... they have nothing.  

Reddit is a liberal safespace.  This is all they have left to retreat to.  So they tell themselves lies for comfort instead of addressing the issues and at the same time they try to suppress the fact that democrats are jumping ship.  

It's beautiful.  I have an entire mod team sending me harassing PMs now because they finally broke under the pressure.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I said something in r/cringeanarchy and mods in reddittopminds lost their shit and banned me from their subreddit and now they are freaking out crying at me in PMs.  They're having a meltdown and it's absolutely hilarious.     

It's not enough to suppress the truth now they outright attack it.  So of course they are going to try and downplay their defeats.  You don't see them talking about the Dakota pipeline and how it's operational either.  

They are a defeated and desperate group of losers.  They aren't going to act fairly.  They're going to be the biggest bigots on the face of the planet and live in complete denial until they snap under pressure.  

Interestingly enough that will make reddit thrive, as misery loves company and there are plenty of miserable liberal losers here.  It will destroy the integrity of reddit and in the long term... doom the platform, but it will also be a great show.  

This is a daytime drama for me.  I love this shit cause it's not fake.  These fools are real and when they freakout it's not scripted at all.  It gives me great satisfaction to watch these fools burn in their own fire.

I've been looking for a way to say that.

I love opening reddit for the latest screeching about how TRUMP BAD!  He's been toast any day now for a year-ish, they just don't seem to learn the lesson that he's not going anywhere, and he only uses twitter to troll (very successfully I might add.)

    <div class="md">&gt; The liberals have caused a massive rift within their party that prevents them from having a unified message America will accept. They don't have a working platform, they don't have a message, they don't have real leaders... they have nothing. 

You're right, but the Republican party doesn't offer much in the way of leadership, either.  The only coherent message out of that side of the aisle is "UNDO OBAMA".  There's no leadership in a direction that actually strengthens America.  There's no governance.  The focus is simply on "winning", and no one has stepped forward to give an idea of what "winning" even looks like.

Politics in America is in utter tatters, across the board.  I get that Americans tend not to get their news from beyond their borders, and generally tunnel-vision themselves into one or two sources within them, so I'm not surprised Americans are unable to view their system objectively.  That's dangerous.

In 2016 Americans were asked to choose between two equally worthless candidates.  Who's stepping forward on either side of the aisle to actually promote better conditions, better opportunities, for the majority of Americans?  Bernie's platform probably delivers the most benefit to the most people, but American political culture isn't mature enough to even start the discourse.  Who on the right is trying to hand back the rights that have been steadily ganked from the people since 9/11?  Under Bush and Obama the state of affairs has gotten steadily worse, and even more so under Trump, who has no idea how to reduce his golf score let alone govern a country.

America's lost its moral high ground on nearly every global stage, and that's the fault of both Democrats and Republicans, not to mention the people who are so focused on "winning" rather than "governance".

Remember, it's called "*govern*ment"; not "*winning*ment".</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; You're right, but the Republican party doesn't offer much in the way of leadership, either.

I get sick of hearing people cry "but they did this."  As if it's a valid argument when it's nothing more than pure deflection and it's a lie.  

The Republicans/conservatives do have a message and direction.  Their message is "we defend the constitution and believe in safety and security."  That's where they stand and it's where they have stood for a very long time.  People like you don't understand that because you're looking past it.

Look at what they are doing.  They're strengthening ICE to purge the illegals from the nation, the supreme court has approved of Trump's travel bans and they are upholding their values.  They're also passing laws to prevent things like Sharia law from destroying American values.

It is you that lacks objectivity.  Conservatives are about conserving American values.  They're not about making radical changes and pushing towards globalism.  

Also I got some news for you.  There is no moral high ground in this world.  That's just some shit you tell yourself.  Every country has done some pretty terrible things and places like Canada, the UK and Germany are doing some extremely shameful things to their citizens by suppressing their freedom of speech and imprisoning them for speaking their minds.

Trump has made more progress than you give him credit for.  You just don't like the guy because he's not a traditional president.  He's a shit talker and he'll tell you exactly how he feels and that's one of his virtues.  Cause he can be rather honest in telling you what he thinks and he's not afraid to change his mind.

    <div class="md">Once you set aside people's 'feelings', there are good reasons to ban abortion along with welfare and feminist propaganda in schools.

The poor getting fucked is literally how the economy works since banks exist, so unless you somehow manage to reform that, there is no point in complaining, just work harder than the poor if you have a problem with poverty.</div>

    <div class="md">...this guy has no idea what conservatives are about.  He knows absolutely nothing about their party and he wants to make judgement calls.  

Conservative:  holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation, typically in relation to politics or religion.

Conservatives are anti abortion.  So it should be no surprise that they oppose abortion now should it?  I mean fucking duh.  You don't even know what the fuck conservatives are about and you're acting outraged that they're following their own doctrine.

Consider yourself blocked.  

Word of advice.  Learn what the fuck you're talking about before you start making judgment calls.

They also believe the government being able to tell you that you can't kill somebody. They're not ancaps for Christ's sake and if you believe abortion is murder (I'm not arguing for or against here) then it's quite logical it should be illegal like all other forms of murder. 

Arguing that Republicans are for big gubmint because of abortions is silly.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; You can't have small government and have q government that tells you what you can do to your own body

Not if you believe that is a human being and not just another body part.  

&gt; sure take the argument of murder

What? You can't just say, "sure it might be murder but whatever", you actually have to use arguments that show it isn't murder. 

&gt;but guess what not everyone feels that way or has that view

Welcome to democracy where all you need is a majority and you can pass whatever you like.

Being pro-life is not really a Christian tenant like Jesus is our Lord and Savior but logically stems from "Thou shalt not kill" which I'm sure you support.

Edit: I'm not a Conservative or a Republican (or an American for that matter) but what would show Republican hypocrisy in terms of not being a small government party is how much they've expanded spying on citizens (e.g. the PATRIOT Act) and the military. They'll instantly respond with but Democrats did the same thing, which they did but the Democrats don't hide the fact that they're a big government party. </div>

    <div class="md">My argument for that it's not murder is that it stems from a moral issue, hence my line after that statement which you neglected. 

For some people life beings at sperm and egg others think not, that's a personal ideal, what science says on the matter is irrelevant because an 'expert' can be found to rally for any side of an argument. 

Like you said some people BELIVE it's murder well some people believe in Thor should we tailor out society to those on the fringes?

Though shall not kill is fucking retarded to claim when this country wages a major war every 10 years. You can't pick and choose where to apply the tenants of Christ if that's something you believe and follow.    

Also if we live in a democracy where the majority rules then how did Trump get elected with less overall votes, it's not so cut and dry. </div>

    <div class="md">&gt;My argument for that it's not murder is that it stems from a moral issue, hence my line after that statement which you neglected. 

But you didn't actually provide an argument, there's no need to be so hostile. Getting back to the original discussion for a second, the role of government is to protect people's basic natural rights and IF abortion is murder then clearly government intervention is necessary. This is not an example of the GOP's hypocrisy (although there are countless other examples).

&gt;For some people life beings at sperm and egg others think not, that's a personal ideal, what science says on the matter is irrelevant because an 'expert' can be found to rally for any side of an argument.

And I thought conservatives were anti-science :&gt; I jest. I actually agree with you here since, in the end science doesn't matter when it comes to morality.

&gt;Like you said some people BELIVE it's murder well some people believe in Thor should we tailor out society to those on the fringes?

And why not err on the side of not murdering a human being? I'm not even going to respond to the Thor strawman.

&gt;Though shall not kill is fucking retarded to claim when this country wages a major war every 10 years. You can't pick and choose where to apply the tenants of Christ if that's something you believe and follow.    

I'm not sure who you're mad atbut I agree, which is why I mentioned that in my post above. Not just waging a war every 10 years but you guys have been at war for every single day of Obama's presidency and a majority of Bush's, too.

&gt;Also if we live in a democracy where the majority rules then how did Trump get elected with less overall votes, it's not so cut and dry.  

Just to nitpick on tip of your nitpick, Clinton didn't get a majority either. Its not a direct democracy but its still a democracy.</div>

And calling an unborn person a parasite just to win an internet argument seems a little extreme to me.

And nice moral relativism at the end there, by the way. Perhaps we should scrap all laws? You dont happen to be an ancap or an amcom perchance? </div>

    <div class="md">A parasite can not survive without a host, you keep referring to and calling the parasite growing inside a woman a 'person' , if the woman was killed or died would the 'person' live? No It needs it's host to survive and thus a dependent parasite.  

 Lets make abortion illegal, the mother has the right to drink alcohol that's not illegal, she can drink the baby to death,  is that a better outcome and way to get the same goal?

Anytime something is made illegal prohibition causes people to do it anyway in a non professional manner.   

Stealing is wrong because it impacts people not a parasite growing inside a woman who has the right to do what she wants with her body. Like you said your rights end where my nose begins. </div>

    <div class="md">From dictionary.com: "an organism that lives on or in an organism of another species, known as the host, from the body of which it obtains nutriment." AFAIK, a fetus is of the same species as a person. Not only that, but parasites tend to be harmful to the host or the host's body tries to eradicate the parasite and there is a negative relationship between the parasite and the host. 

There's a reason why biologists differentiate between parasites and fetuses.

&gt;Anytime something is made illegal prohibition causes people to do it anyway in a non professional manner.

And? I have no sympathy for somebody trying to murder someone and not being able to do it professionally.

&gt;Like you said your rights end where my nose begins.

The baby also has rights, was my point of bringing that up. 

At this point we're just repeating the same arguments with different dressing to each other (it's just her body vs no it's a person) so I don't think there's anymore we can discuss. </div>

    <div class="md">So if the mind and thoughts of a person are the desire and removal of a fetus is that not a way the body can manifest that desire and need? Does it need to be an autoimmune response? 

What if the mother threatens suicide with a gun if she doesn't get an abortion who's life is more valuable?

So the mother can drink the baby to death, and there's nothing you or anyone can do to stop that, glad you're okay driving people to poison themselves for something they don't want.

Also there are tons of times when a mother's life is in danger or the babies itself because of nature should we not murder the fetus when the mother's life's on danger?

    <div class="md">These are more pragmatic questions and not moral questions and probably better answered by somebody who is more well-versed in law but they seem interesting so I'll give them a shot anyway.

&gt;So if the mind and thoughts of a person are the desire and removal of a fetus is that not a way the body can manifest that desire and need? Does it need to be an autoimmune response?

Bioligically, yes. The body needs to biologically reject the parasite. Just because my sister disliked her mole and wanted it removed doesn't mean it's a parasite. 

&gt;What if the mother threatens suicide with a gun if she doesn't get an abortion who's life is more valuable?

Who is she threatening? If she's threatening a doctor to perform an abortion or else she'll kill herself, then I wouldn't know what to do with the doctor and that's a question for a lawyer or a judge whether it's manslaughter, etc. After the operation is performed, she should go to jail though.

&gt; So the mother can drink the baby to death, and there's nothing you or anyone can do to stop that, glad you're okay driving people to poison themselves for something they don't want.

Why should I have sympathy for somebody trying to murder an unborn child because it's inconvenient? 

&gt; Also there are tons of times when a mother's life is in danger or the babies itself because of nature should we not murder the fetus when the mother's life's on danger?

I would make an exception to if the mother's life is in peril because it's no good if both of them die (could also be considered as an act of self-defense).

Tons is kind of a stretch. [In 1987-88](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/tables/2411798t2.pdf), 2.8% of abortions were due to risk of maternal health. Kind of a dated study, but I'd be surprised if that number has gone up in the past 30 years with the advancement of modern medicine and should keep going down.

&gt; An organism that lives and gets it's nutrients from a host, no where does it state anything about being from a different species or similar species.

    <div class="md">Are you reading your answers? You're contradicts your own views within that response.

On one hand you would rather save the mother the the baby if her life is at risk and could kill them both.

On the other hand you say fuck the woman who wants an abortion and willing to poison/ drink the baby to death and possibly kill herself too. This also applies to wire hanger or book room abortions infections and contamination is a huge problem. 

If you sinply just let the second person have an abortion your still net positive one person, the mother, who could potentially have more offspring later on in life. 

Wereas you don't care if she dies since she's seeking to kill the baby via drinking it and possibly herself to death. Pretty fucking heartless if you ask me.  

A mole is not comparable to a parasite or fetus nor a living entity in anyway. They don't have potential for 'living', it's a mutated skin cell .  </div>

    <div class="md">I do not want health insurance period.  Paying in cash in 20-30% cheaper everywhere. Why would I pay out the ass for insurance when I can pay cash get a discount and be fucking done? Not everyone wants or needs fucking health insurance. It isnt affordable at all and didnt cover any damn thing. No prescription, or anything.  It was fucking usless. It only helps if you are jobless, or a women with no baby daddy.  </div>

    <div class="md">So you're never gonna get sick? You're never going to be in a car accident? You're never going to break an arm? You're never going to be diabetic? Do you have a pre-existing condition?

 It didn't cover anything because you probably had a huge maximum out of pocket and until that kicks in you're paying for shit. Many people hit their maximum out of pocket the first second of the new year, I'm guessing you've never been in a hospital overnight, you've never experienced a 6 figure hospital bill.

Do you have car insurance? Have you ever been in an accident? Why should you need to carry car insurance?

 Please show me where you can get a 20-30% discount on Prescription drugs for paying cash.  </div>

    <div class="md">You're completely wrong when you die who foots the medical bills? Do you have savings?When you're in the hospital on life support, or when you go to the ER, or you end up in hospice some sort of long term care. 

As a republican im sure you understand the government collect taxes on you. Guess what if you're not healthy and can't work, taxes can't be collected. You're a burden on society. The tax payers pay for that, so your health, my health, everyone's health impacts everyone financially.    

Your bills where not payed for by Obama care because you probably didn't reach the maximum out of pocket, do you know what your amount was vs how much the bills where? </div>

If you're of the party of religious values how is denying your fellow man access to health care morally okay?

 You think Jesus who let his own feet be washed with expensive oil instead of selling them for profit would be for or against expanding healthcare... </div>

    <div class="md">You're confused.  

I was in r/cringeanarchy and made a comment at someone who happened to be a mod of reddittopminds.  So he went into reddittodminds and banned me.  

He went to another subreddit I was part of, where he had power because he's powerless in r/cringeanarchy, and banned me where he could.  

Do you understand?</div>

    <div class="md">The left is dying.  

The liberals are killing them.

And eventually everyone wakes up.  You see people on the left snapping every day.  It's due to a weak psychological hierarchy lefties tend to have.  Too many of them worship government and government is fallible.  

Have you ever noticed that people on the left who are religious handle things better than the ones who aren't?  It's because they put a metaphysical belief towards the top of their hierarchies.  Thus if government falls out of favor with them... their world is still okay.  But when you worship government and your god (government) betrays you... it's a hard pill to swallow.  

I mean you have lefties who have be driven to such insanity that they buy guns and shoot at conservatives.  

Hey liberals... where's your god now?  lol          </div>

Headline :  "Trump travel ban: US supreme court partially lifts block on order "

Cool... You guys are really fighting the system, FYI /r/ politics did had several threads on the travel ban in the bottom of the first page/top of second page, not that you care...</div>

This time.  Because of Russian interference.

It's not "my way or the highway".  There's just a correct way to be, and your party doesn't represent it in any way.  Your party represents the very worst of us.... a "me first, fuck you last" mentality.

Don't bother responding.  Just downvote like a good little clown.  I don't want to talk to you any longer.... and you probably don't want to talk to me.  And that's fine.</div>

    <div class="md">It IS positive sounding for the Trump camp. It's what he promised and what he's now delivering. You can argue if it's bad in itself but the news itself is a positive if you voted Trump.</div>
