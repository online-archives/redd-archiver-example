    <div class="md">/politics or one of the other thousands of cesspools of rabid leftist propaganda on reddit, is clearly much more OP's speed.

Somewhere they can spew baseless shaming attempts against conservatives all day long. OP will be far happier in their own environment.</div>

    <div class="md">Interesting that you are being downvoted. Right-wing nut jobs is why I almost completely stopped posting there. Once in a while I'll see a thread that is worthy and has good discussion, but most of the time, it's just political bullshit in that sub.

    <div class="md">There is no longer "opinion" there, and when there is, it's no longer a point of interest for the community. As the community has become inundated with people that just want to act like POS that can't be wrong. Or just want to tell you how you are wrong, but not provide information as to how.

I'm sure this site will be left with more declining mental health issues than constructive action being taken.</div>

    <div class="md">Total bullshit.  You're allowed to spew all the nonsense you want. 

If you constantly and consistently bring your Shareblue level bullshit though, abusive against mods and everyone else, step way over the line of intelligent conversion into downright abuse as OP obviously has on many occasions...

you can't complain about getting the axe.  

/conspiracy is extremely tolerant of all manner of opinions.  You really have to step WAY over the line to get a comment removed, let alone get a ban. 

Those that try to spread blatant hate and propaganda ala /politics are the ones with mental health issues.</div>

    <div class="md">You'll feel FAR more at home on /politics.  Why don't you just toddle on back there.

Or, at least TRY to say something slightly intelligent.

/Conspiracy allows all manner of rabid leftist nonsense.  It is constantly and consistently debunked with logic and reason. That's all. 

Spouting blatant bullshit and outright rabid leftist lies is spam.  Binning such is not censorship, it si good moderation.</div>

    <div class="md">False. 

The rest of reddit turned into a cesspool of rabid leftist Shareblue propaganda. Especially these last 4 years.

You're just so use to the cult of Marxism spewing there nonsense non-stop, anything *slightly* conservative looks out of place to you.

Reddit is a LEFT wing political playground, as anyone with two brain cells to rub together fully acknowledges (unless they're also trying to spread lies).</div>

Well, rabid liberals and neoliberal/centrist propaganda...

Leftists/progressives are often silenced by automod or downvoted into oblivion when they dare criticize corp centrist dems and dem party leadership and elite or even liberal MSM. They often get attacked and accused of being Trump supporters/running interference for Trump and spreading qAnon and Russian disinfo for posting unflattering facts about Biden, Pelosi etc.</div>

    <div class="md">Fully accurate, except,

please do not confuse the far left with "liberals".  

Liberals (not libertarians) have a strong ephesis on individualism, individual liberty, and the individual responsibility that comes with it.

Rabid leftists / progressives are the opposite. Massively authoritarian and collectivist.  There really is no comparison.

Sad that the moniker "liberal" has been so polluted these days, *falsely* referring to downright Marxist boot lickers. Commies even.

Let's try to keep it clean. Conservatives have liberal ideas, in the *true* sense.  

People that spread such nonsense about Trump, they are not "liberals", they are mostly clueless commie kids, mindlessly regurgitating Shareblue propaganda that does so much damage here.</div>

    <div class="md">Please do not conflate progressives with far-left. Progressives are not far left, they are leftists. It's liberals voteDEM / vote blue no matter who and idpol progressives who are 'rabid' and pro / enablers of authoritarianism  and tribalism/group think. Liberals are often moderate dems or essentially centrists but pro-corporate / big tech censorship / imperialism etc. I would never call libertarians 'liberals.' That is a slap in the face to libertarians. Tulsi is a good example of a libertarian leaning leftist/progressive.</div>
