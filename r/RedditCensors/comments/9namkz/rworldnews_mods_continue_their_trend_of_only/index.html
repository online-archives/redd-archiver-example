https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9mz8wy/trump_suggests_the_climate_may_actually_be/

Here is my comment that was removed:

https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9mz8wy/trump_suggests_the_climate_may_actually_be/e7j5zws/

&gt;For anyone else confused as to how this post is allowed to stay up:

&gt;According to the sidebar for /r/WorldNews, the following submissions are not allowed:

&gt;US Internal News/US Politics
&gt;Editorials, Opinion, Analysis
&gt;Editorialized titles
&gt;Misleading titles

&gt;However there is a loophole that isn't listed on the side bar: *Any article that makes Trump look bad is not required to abide by the rules.*

&gt;Here's what he actually said, not what the article used as its title because it's a trash piece on Trump:

&gt;&gt;"I can give you reports that are fabulous, and I can give you reports that aren't so good," Trump said.

&gt;Maybe the mods should enforce their rules and not allow super misleading titles like this since all they do is fuel their own personal narrative rather than provide actual news. Also, maybe the mods should make the sub about world news, not "only world news except news that makes Trump look bad in which case please post it". What an absolute garbage subreddit. 


I messaged the mods immediately asking why my comment was removed. Here's that conversation:

1. http://magaimg.net/img/6f67.jpg
2. http://magaimg.net/img/6f68.jpg

So they said it broke their "no meta comments" rule. Anyone else not seeing that rule in their sidebar? Ok, then they said to message them if I had an issue with the post. So I did just that. I asked, multiple times, how the post wasn't breaking their rules by absolutely misquoting the president and then using that misquote as the title, making the title absolutely misleading. And of course I get nothing back, just deflection. It's like they have some huge agenda to push stories that make Trump look bad and any comments pointing this out and pointing out how posts that do this are breaking the subreddits rules just get censored away. </div>

I've also noticed a few of the same people always putting up anti-Trump nonsense in worldnews.</div>
