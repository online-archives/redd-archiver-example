    <div class="md">If you comment on certain sub reddits then TwoX will just ban you. I think it's them being passive aggressive and trying to be a relevant sub.

After quickly checking your comment history I can safely tell you it's because you posted a comment in r/The_Donald because I've seen it happen before.

r/twoxchromosomes is a sub full of intolerant mods who sit upon the high horse of hypocrisy and double standards. You did nothing wrong, TwoX is just a shitty sub with shitty mods.</div>

    <div class="md">If it makes you feel any better about how outright absurd that sub is, that is the same place that had a "woman" lie about completing a marathon,  get gilded, rah rah girl power, only to be called out on her BS lie and then have the idiots there backtrack and tell her "that's okay, we believe in you anyhow" and let her off the hook after lying to everyone. 

also the sub where "women" who were "raped" tell the other "women" there that they are not reporting their rapist that they know, to the cops nor reporting the rape at all. Then when asked "what do you want to say to the women here who is about to be raped by him next" they reply that it's their choice. 

That sub exists to make women victims and to keep them victims. If it were secretly run by women-hating trolls, I wouldn't be surprised. 

there's a level of lying, fake women, and horsefuckery stupid shit in that subreddit that I think is perhaps the worst in all of this site because it;'s disguised as good advice.</div>
