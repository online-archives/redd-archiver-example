    <div class="md">The general group flocking to reddit these days are either marketers, or the masses of unthinking copycat "say whatever gets me liked" types. Generally they stick to the default subs so if you unsub from the defaults and find other subs you will get a better viewing experience. (though that will only last so long) 

Reddit is now a main stream social media platform, and just like all main stream social media it is subject to the whim of the mob. Individuality is thought of as an anathema.

We are in a new Era of communication, and still getting used to it. We, as a species, used to value conformity in order to survive, and it was only over many generations and social upheaval that we started to value individuality... in some countries. But not every culture values individual choice, so when you mix a bunch of cultures together online you're bound to have some clashes.

Hopefully individuality will win... But it's too soon to tell.</div>

    <div class="md">Great comment, I would definitely agree that its due to the vast differences of people on the platform. In my last post l argued that a company was not being legitimate and upholding their word. I got trashed by many reddit users for going against the company. This seems very dangerous for people to not support the 1st amendment. If we don’t support and fight for our rights we could lose them.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh, do you have one more thought for you. There are certain words that will get you completely banned from Reddit. You post a lot of things about hip Hop, there's a word they often use to refer to each other that under no circumstances can you use on Reddit. Give it a try see what happens. It is also available offense to use a derogatory term to refer to somebody's sexual orientation. Give that a try and see how fast you get banned not just from the subway that you're on by the moderators, but by Reddit the administrators. There are multiple court rulings but social media sites can enforce their own speech codes and conduct requirements it has absolutely nothing to do with the Constitution of the United States which only governs your relationship with the government not private corporations. Better yet if you think you have free speech why don't you go tell your boss exactly what you think of him, just make sure you packed up any personal items you have because you're going to be fired and escorted off the property and guess what it ain't a free speech issue the Constitution will not protect you. I think that may even apply if your boss and you both work for the federal government. You haven't attacked the government you have attacked him personally. Also your remarks in the post that you refuse to edit with issue solved could be seen as defamatory by the company in question but you could be sued. You really ought to educate yourself about what free speech is and is not.</div>

    <div class="md">The first amendment has nothing to do with Reddit. It only relates to the government being able to regulate your speech.

Edit: I have now found the post that this redditor is talking about. He posted misinformation and has refused to take down his post. I'm guessing it's a 13-year-old or someone who has yet to mature past that point</div>

    <div class="md">Define the misinformation in the other post. I said I was having trouble with a company, which on its own is a losing battle for an individual to go against a corporation. That is why it is important for individuals opinions on a company to be protected. Otherwise companies such as google, microsoft, could stomp all over us without any of us being able to point out the problem. Thanks for proving my point in this post and nice work stooping to insults of my maturity.</div>

    <div class="md">You said the company was impossible to reach. You first reply I told you how to find the number in your account. A lower reply said oh all I had to do was Google it and I found the number. You are obviously not intelligent enough to use your account properly or to understand something as simple as google. When you were asked to change your post you refused it should have been taken down by the mods. This is not a free speech issue. You supplied incorrect information were corrected and then refused to correct</div>

    <div class="md">It isn't a free speech issue because this is not a government-run website it is owned by a private corporation. I don't think you understand how Reddit works. The vast majority of subreddits were created by users, they are moderated by users, these users are all volunteers. It's not a free speech issue you need to educate yourself on exactly what free speech is. Call the American civil liberties Union, I'm sure there will be happy to send you a pamphlet that will explain freedom of speech. Your refusal to alter your post after it was pointed out to you that your issue was solved is like  crying fire in a crowded theater, it's not only not free speech it's unethical and generally illegal. Apparently are a spoiled child who has never had to deal with the real world.</div>

You can express your opinion all you want to unfortunately when you express incorrect or even misleading ones you can be sued. Once again contact the American civil liberties Union or possibly the electronic freedom foundation one of them will be happy to explain to you but the first amendment actually means. The people on the other subreddit were very clear that you needed to change your post to issues solve and yet you refused exposing your childish nature and your inability to deal with reality.
