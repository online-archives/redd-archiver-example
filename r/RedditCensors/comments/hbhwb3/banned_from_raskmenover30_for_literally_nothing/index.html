    <div class="md">Yes I've had that happen with a few subs I wasn't even subscribed to or anything.

They must have not liked your comment about trans-fats.  Maybe they thought you were talking about your tinder date and not a toxic food product.  

Seriously some of these subs will just ban you if they realize you made a single comment in a sub they don't like 6 months ago.   I have been banned from subs I haven't even ever visited because there's some kind of auto trigger when you comment in a "forbidden" sub.   It's really friggin weird.</div>

    <div class="md">If thats literally what they banned me for then that'd be hilarious.  I was taking a C&amp;M Bio course last year and we talked about why the government banned trans-fats.  I hadn't even considered someone might have thought I was making an insensitive transgender joke.  Man I knew reddit had gotten bad, but this place is ruled by total nazis

    <div class="md">it's against reddit rules for mods to do it, but admins don't enforce it because they're all buddy buddy with the powermods doing it.

what is it?  in the mod rules, it says you shouldn't ban someone on basis of participation in another sub.  there are tons of subs that will pre-emptively ban you even when you've never participated, solely on the basis that you participate in any anti-woke subs.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes!  With an older account I know longer have.  I was having a male-related health issue and asked a question about it.  I was muted for a few days before I was allowed back.  I reworded the question and asked again.  I was then banned for asking for "masturbation fodder"!  Idk what that even is!  I was having testicular issues and was asking about that.  I guess the mods thought I was asking for dick pics?  Idk.  🤷‍♂️</div>

    <div class="md">I had a problem with some content of mine being removed, so I contacted the mod through the "message the moderator" link.

I worked the problem out with him. He thanked me for being polite and mature with him about it.  He said he gets many messages with an attitude of entitlement and that are flat out rude,demanding.  He told me he just scrolls past those.

Maybe contacting the mods the way a Karen would **not** do it might help.  You know polite, friendly and not like they owe you anything.

You have nothing to lose.</div>

    <div class="md">I haven't bothered.  I just moved on.  Not exactly noble, but its less of a loss than I originally worried about.  Honestly, I value the opinion of reddit a lot less these days, and for good reason.  For too long I put reddit on a pedestal above other social media outlets, not critically reviewing its content as biased just like all the other media content I consume.  But reddit is incredibly biased, just as all media outlets.  I have to get my news from many varied sources, not just reddit(despite it being a supposed news aggregate site, it is not so much anymore.  Its become a vapid echo chamber, devoid of real thoughtful discussion).  If groups wish to remove me without justifiable cause, then they expose their biases as extremist and I must label their platform as such.  I'm basically just here for video game and table top memes these days.</div>
