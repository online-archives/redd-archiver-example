The last 5 posts go from someone getting banned for wanting to use the N-word but is too much of a bitch to just be overtly racist(not surprising because racism stems from fear). Then the next post is someone being (again scared) overtly transphobic. The most recent post after that is some user getting banned for supporting a white terrorist and mocking people who want him to face justice. 4th most recent post is someone defending the shooting of Daunte Write. Saying he deserved death due to his non-violent actions. 5th post might be the worst because it's someone who supports BLM but has their post commandeered by racists afraid of equality. I understand not everything I see here will be something I agree with; but how is everything I'm seeing just snowflake conservatives mad they don't have a safe space to be an absolute piece of human refuse.

When I joined the sub the whole China- Blizzard/Activision debacle was happening. I thought I would be getting more content of reddit itself deciding information should not be passed along. Or power tripping Mods at the minimum. Who tf cares if someone gets banned from a sub for being a racist or overall dickish.</div>
