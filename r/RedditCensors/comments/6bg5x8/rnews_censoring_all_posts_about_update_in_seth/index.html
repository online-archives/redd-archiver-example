this sounds absurd to me. i don't know much about russian tactics, but it doesn't seem like russia to kill someone for outing them as a hacker. they would most likely not do anything and release a vague statement of denial</div>

    <div class="md">It does.

DC has ShotSpotter. It's an automated gunfire detector. That means if a gun goes off, there will be police there in minutes. 

So this guy shot Seth, panicked, tried to get his watch and tore the strap, and then realized he was out of time because of ShotSpotter. So he ran.

This is an area which has been plagued by robberies because it's wealthy, and there's a ton of Howard University students with cash, new phones, and drugs. It is a target rich environment for muggers, the whole U-Street corridor is. Last time I was there, some creeper started following me and my wife, but we bugged out by grabbing a passing cab.

It may not make sense to people who don't live here, but we see this shit every fucking day. There are shootings here regularly. Muggings too. 

Congress won't let us raise our own taxes, but they also won't give us the resources we need to fucking fix southeast.

But southeast doesn't stay in southeast. The block crews and the drug dealers go where the college kids are.

That's U Street. That's Bloomingdale. That's where Seth got gunned down.

If that's not what happened, I do want to know. Whoever killed someone in my city, I want them found, I want them brought to justice.

If you look at this literally senseless violence and say that it just doesn't make sense, I agree. But if you don't think this senselessness is normal for my city, then you don't know my city.

I want this shit to stop.

But I don't have a congressman. I don't have a senator. I pay taxes, but I have no representation in congress. 

So I have to deal with the idiots that other Americans elect, and have no say.

We can fix our own damned problems if people would just get out of our way. 

We don't want federal handouts and the BS that comes with them anymore. We want to bring in our own harvest, and ring our own till. But the rest of the country won't let us.

And they won't let our police do their jobs either.</div>

    <div class="md">That's not "according to the family." 

That's "according to a spokesperson for the family," who is a professional DNC crisis consultant.

Here's Seth Rich's parents speaking for themselves. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BEsacP9vWA&amp;feature=youtu.be
