https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/scejd2/boston_hospital_refuses_heart_transplant_for_man/hu644g4/?context=3

&gt;&gt;Looking at these comments is really sad. Dehumanising people isn't a good thing regardless.

&gt;Have you seen the sub hermaincainaward?

That one ^ wasn't removed before I messaged the mods (but may be now)

Someone replied:

&gt;People posted to that sub choose to not get vaxxed and put countless people at risk. It’s entirely their fault

I replied with:

&gt;You can still get and pass the virus if you are vaccinated. You can still die as well. Obviously it reduces chances of serious illness, so if you are afraid of getting ill, get the vaccine. What does it matter if someone else decides they don't want to get the vaccine? You can get it from someone who is vaccinated. You can't vaccinate your way out of a pandemic with a leaky vaccine. This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated. That is misinformation. The sub embraces misinformation and takes joy in others suffering.

I got downvoted into oblivion for both comments and the above one was removed. I noticed this a bit ago, along with realizing all the others removed.

Another comment removed:

&gt;I recommend reading the slate article about the hermancainaward sub. 

That one was immediately removed by automod after posting, I had noticed.

Another comment of mine that was removed:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Still not a pandemic of the unvaccinated.

&gt;&gt;Call any overburdened ICU in this country and ask the vaccination status of 90%+ of their patients.

&gt;&gt;Yes, it is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Pull your head out of your ass.

&gt;It's really not and our overburdened hospitals speaks more to for profit healthcare system. Hospitals have closed. Staff have been cut. They admitted ICU beds are not profitable, that is why we don't have more. The year before the pandemic, hospitals were overcrowded. I am fully vaccinated and I am against vaccine mandates. I also think this talking point about hospitals is BS because it ignores the underlying issue which I mentioned above.

Another:

&gt;&gt;Yes, it is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Pull your head out of your ass.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/oct/04/no-its-not-a-pandemic-of-the-unvaccinated-it-still-threatens-us-all

And another:

&gt;&gt;Calling someone a plague rat is fine. They generally are. And there aren't too many actually taking enjoyment from another's death.

&gt;There are, I have browsed that sub, after reading an article about it. Calling people 'plague rats' is pretty despicable. How about those who are vaccinated and spread it to others, are they plague rats? Those who are vaccinated and don't mask or practice good hygiene and social distancing, are they plague rats? If you are punching left and right and down, you are helping to divide the American people, which only helps the elite who have profited off of this pandemic. Stop doing what they want you to do and attacking your neighbor. People censoring discussion and forcing others to get a vaccine, is authoritarian and equally disturbing and despicable.

This one wasn't removed at the time I had noticed most others had been (but may now be remove after messaging the mod):

&gt;&gt;It's not a pandemic of the unvaccinated?

&gt;https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02243-1/fulltext

&gt;There is increasing evidence that vaccinated individuals continue to have a relevant role in transmission. In Massachusetts, USA, a total of 469 new COVID-19 cases were detected during various events in July, 2021, and 346 (74%) of these cases were in people who were fully or partly vaccinated, 274 (79%) of whom were symptomatic.

&gt;You see countries that have a high vaccinated rate that were still ravaged by covid. That does not support your assertion about it being a pandemic of the unvaccinated. If the vaccine made you completely immune to getting the virus, then I would probably agree with you, but that is not the case.

Someone wrote:

&gt;Vaccination causes a shorter infectious period, feweer symptoms and tons of other such stuff, so while you CAN still transmit it, the CHANCE is lower

I replied with (and this was also removed):

&gt;And studies suggest early treatments can help reduce time of and severity of sickness. I can't mention them out of fear of being censored and banned, however there are articles about them on nih. What else you can do is losing weight. Studies suggest vitamins like d, c, zinc, k2 etc can also help in the fight against covid. There is another nih article about this. Even CBD (often prescribed in oil form) is looking like it could help.

&gt;It's 2 years in to the pandemic. Why is Fauci not saying these things and instead has misled people to believe that if only everyone got vaccinated, the virus would go away? Now he is saying it's likely everyone will get it, which is what others were saying much earlier and got censored for it. You can't vaccinate your way out of a pandemic using a leaky vaccine. So why so much attention solely on the vaccine as a solution but no mention of the above by Fauci? Wait, he did say something, he demonized potential early treatments and MSM (big pharma funded) helped.

&gt;Just as those who talked about the lab leak hypothesis were censored and smeared as conspiracy theorists for the longest time, just as Fauci wanted done to the Great Barrington Declaration early on, emails show.

&gt;Still not a pandemic of the unvaccinated. I think one issue is leading people to believe that if they have been vaccinated that they can't get it or give it, that if everyone just got vaccinated, we could get rid of the virus and this is simply not true. People who thought this way, could have covid despite being vaccinated, have milder symptoms, go out rather than isolating and spread it to others and people likely caught it this way and died. Just something to think about. Especially for those calling people plague rats and taking enjoyment in others catching and dying from covid.

So I messaged the mod and said: 

&gt;Just curious why my comment here was removed:

https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/scejd2/boston_hospital_refuses_heart_transplant_for_man/hu6y4xf/?context=3

and a number of my replies down this comment chain have been removed:

https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/scejd2/boston_hospital_refuses_heart_transplant_for_man/hu644g4/?context=3

My comments aren't misinformation and I can see comments from others who post inaccurate stuff on covid-19 in this thread and I am not asking for their comments to be removed. Why the censorship?? Do you just go by reports? Because there are people who report comments in bad faith to get it removed, whether they are misinformed or just trying to suppress certain information and discussion. Why enable that?

Mods replied 2 minutes later with:

&gt;Thanks for pointing out the issue. You should have been banned. You are now.

&gt;Covid misinfo is a instant permaban. Cheers.

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/news. You can still view and subscribe to r/news, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/news by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/news. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/news for 28 days.

Seriously though. The censorship is outrageous, but furthermore, who decides what is and isn't misinformation? Just as I said, there were people in the comment section (who were upvoted) who got gotten stuff wrong about covid and I (who was heavily downvoted) had comments removed despite them containing accurate information about covid. Like what is wrong with these people?


I also had a comment removed from r/Music 

https://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/sc0b2a/neil_young_demands_spotify_remove_his_music_over/hu7ct9i/?context=3

&gt;&gt;Here's one article fact-checking a doctor Rogan has had on (episode #1757). He is a dangerous liar who is benefiting from spreading misinformation. There are plenty more articles if you search his name.

&gt;Dangerous misinformation? Like Fauci telling people they didn't need masks, that they didn't work? How about when Biden said that if you were vaccinated, you could not get sick? How about Rachel Maddow saying you couldn't get the virus if you are vaccinated? Authoritative sources have spread covid misinformation and potentially dangerous misinformation over Covid, but Rogan is so bad that he fact checked himself on his own show and admitted he was wrong.

I messaged the mods and asked why it was removed. I explained that it was not misinformation. 

Music mods said it was removed by automod but that they would reinstate the post. Props to mods there.

Is anyone else experiencing this sort of this? I am so fed up with the censorship over covid. I recall being censored over it at the start of the pandemic and each time I was censored, It was stuff from experts and I provided citation (though it wasn't being said by Fauci or MSM at the time) and then a half year later + when the abovementioned would talk about it, then it was acceptable to talk about it. This happened a few times over the course of the last 2 years. First it was talking about the virus potentially sticking around (sticking with us like the flu) and how it could be spread asymptomatically, also covering early reports out of China/leaked reports, then over criticizing Cuomo on the nursing homes at the time he was being praised and given an award. I recall also being censored over just mentioning experts looking into potential treatments to go along with the vaccine. Why do they always say stuff like 'cheers' and 'have a nice day' after they ban you or ignore your appeal? These people act like tyrannical children.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; It's really not and our overburdened hospitals speaks more to for profit healthcare system. Hospitals have closed. Staff have been cut. They admitted ICU beds are not profitable, that is why we don't have more.

I don't have time to respond to anything else right now, but this take is kind of silly. Yes, America's healthcare coverage has serious problems, but ICU capacity (equipment and trained staff) never ever scales well. It requires too much time, commitment and people to get capacity of that level ready to be able to scale well. Especially when it comes to pandemics. No matter what you do, you will never have enough ICU capacity to cover what you're really going to need for a pandemic like this one.

Vaccinations scale infinitely better. And being vaccinated relatively/statistically keeps you out of the ICU (and hospitals). This is a measured fact around the world. So yes, being unvaccinated is a huge part of the problem of hospitals/ICU's being overwhelmed right now. There's no question about that.</div>

Yeah, my argument is those using this ICU argument should really look deeper into the problem, not just on the surface level of covid patients, but why we lack ICU beds, why hospitals have closed and staff have been cut.

&gt;Vaccinations scale infinitely better. And being vaccinated relatively/statistically keeps you out of the ICU (and hospitals). This is a measured fact around the world.

I never argued otherwise.</div>

So your conclusion is that everyone should allow and tolerate harmful misinformation? What's the benefit of it, except that some idiots get the ability to flood their idiocy on the internet, that already killed a lot of people? Sorry, but if you think that way it is grossly negligent.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't think information that differs from the approved narrative, or what you refer to as "misinformation" is harmful. I think it's good for people to be exposed to all different kinds of information, and naturally some of that info will contradict other info. I think the idea that only one approved narrative is allowed to exist in a "marketplace of ideas" is dangerous, and that people feel that it's okay to attack the character of people simply for disagreeing with them.</div>

    <div class="md">I can see how facts could harm those who, whether they realize it yet or not, are following agendas blindfully.  Not that Governments have a history of being nefarious; see The 'Tuskegee Study' for a humbling introduction into it.

Yes, you can still end up as a Covid hospitalization statistic whether you are vaccinated or not. You can still spread it and die from it whether you are vaccinated or not as well.

Information regarding any Covid statistic includes dozens of factors, including false positives as a result of relatively new testing practices as well as human error such as accounting and credibility issues.  

This information like any is passed through multiple channels which again increases its risk of being manipulated because of anything from simple mistakes to more nefarious treachery.  

This isn't the place to advocate the suppression of information.  You are however not at fault and I understand why you may be defensive about it.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok here is an example:

&gt;You can still get and pass the virus if you are vaccinated. You can still die as well. Obviously it reduces chances of serious illness, so if you are afraid of getting ill, get the vaccine. **What does it matter if someone else decides they don't want to get the vaccine? You can get it from someone who is vaccinated.** You can't vaccinate your way out of a pandemic with a leaky vaccine. This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated. 

With that statement you are simply saying that it doesn't matter if people take the vaccines , in terms of transmission rates, which is clearly misinformation.</div>

    <div class="md">No, that is not what I am saying. I am saying people should have a right to decide if they want to get it or not and that you can catch covid from vaccinated people and even if you are vaccinated. That is all I was saying. So to those calling others things like 'plague rats' just realize how divisive it is and at the same time, ridiculous. The whole concept of that suggests that if just everyone got it, we would be rid of the virus and it suggests the only people spreading it are the unvaxxed. *That* is misleading.</div>

No it is not! You are in completely denial what you have wrote:

You can't interpret that statement in a different way other than saying that the transmission rate is the same for unvaccinated and vaccinated people. Which is false! The reality is it **does** matter! Therefore it is misinformation.</div>

I am saying to those calling people plague rats and afraid of catching it, to those who want to mandate vaccines, what does it matter to you if someone else decides they don't want to get the vaccine? If you are worried about covid, get vaccinated. I don't know why you are intepreting my statment the way you are, maybe because you are trained to see it this way? In any case, my statement was not misinformation.


&gt;**You can't interpret that statement in a different way other than saying that the transmission rate is the same for unvaccinated and vaccinated people.** Which is false! The reality is it **does** matter! Therefore it is misinformation.

Yes, you can and I never said what you are saying I said. You jumped to conclusions and assume I am saying that the vaccine makes no difference in transmission, but I simply stated a fact. I should have said, it reduced but does not stop but the fact of the matter is that it does not stop you from getting or giving it, which is the crux of my point.

It is misleading to say or suggest that people who are vaccinated cannot get or pass covid or that you can't get sick if you are vaccinated. I have seen MSM, Maddow, Biden, and people across reddit spread those falsehoods and I did not see that censored and called dangerous misinformation.</div>

1) I'm not spreading misinformation but I see a lot of people who do and are upvoted. My guess is you have no concern about that because what they say fits your agenda/bias 2) uh, I'm pretty sure the offical line is that taking such vitamins can help. I think by now this is undisputable 3) there is a study showing that CBD may actually help, that was also not a lie. 4) my issues is people pushing the narrative that if just everyone got vaccinated, we would eradicate the virus and our hospitals would not be overburdened. It would eradicate the virus and I am disputing that and hospitals couldn't be overburdered anyways (as they were the year before the pandemic) because of the for-profit healthcare system, which brought me to that point of the underlying issue, which people seem to ignore/be distracted from when they are just told it would be all good and not happen if only evergone was vaccinated. That is misleading, no?

&gt;People like you don't realize that spreading such bs over the internet might make people not take the vaccine and they could get seriously ill or dead because of that, if they get infected with covid.

You haven't read that far into my post history then because I am vaccinated, I have said how it helps and have advocated for people to get vaccinated if they are worried about getting seriously ill from covid. I have said I am against forcing people to take vaccines. So fucking what. 

It's nice of you to ignore misinformation (and potentially dangerous misinformation) out official sources though.</div>

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;2) uh, I'm pretty sure the offical line is that taking such vitamins can help.

The official line is to take the vaccine not to take vitamins.

*"The researchers found that people receiving the supplements, whether individually or combined,* ***had no improvement in symptoms or a faster recovery*** *when compared with otherwise similar patients receiving neither supplement."*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3) there is a study showing that CBD may actually help, that was also not a lie.

May help doesn't mean anything. Eating bananas and riding on a bicycle may also help. If there is no evidence that it helps there is no good reason to portray it as something good.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;4) my issues is people pushing the narrative that if just everyone got vaccinated, we would eradicate the virus and our hospitals would not be overburdened

We would eradicate the harm the virus does to us and reduce cases with lower transmission rates. 

Less people severely sick &gt; less people on ICU's &gt; greater chance to avoid overburdened hospitals. I don't know where you live at but in my country people had to postpone tumor operations, because the hospitals were so busy.</div>

&gt;"The researchers found that people receiving the supplements, whether individually or combined, had no improvement in symptoms or a faster recovery when compared with otherwise similar patients receiving neither supplement

Nowhere did I ever say you should do these things instead of take the vaccine. I questioned why these things weren't suggested to be done in addition to use of a vaccine.

"Several minerals and vitamins have antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial roles which could be helpful for the immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the absence of a widely available treatment or a vaccine for COVID-19, supplementation of micronutrients emerges as an important measure to improve the immune system and to prevent the development of severe symptoms."

&gt;May help doesn't mean anything. Eating bananas and riding on a bicycle may also help. If there is no evidence that it helps there is no good reason to portray it as something good.

I said may help and that is what the study shows. Again, no misinformation there.

&gt;**We would eradicate the harm the virus does to us** and reduce cases with lower transmission rates. 

How is this not misinformation? Even if everyone was vaccinated, it would not go away and people can still get sick and go to the hospital with it. What was was incorrect in the sentence of mine that you quoted?

&gt;Less people severely sick &gt; less people on ICU's &gt; greater chance to avoid overburdened hospitals.

Yes and yet hospitals were overburdered pre-covid and also, we are 2 years in. If we lack ICU beds and are still overburdered, again, this speaks to our broken healthcare system. Do I think less hospitals would be overburdened if everyone was vaccinated, probably, but I don't think neccesarily that hospitals wouldn't still get overburdered.</div>
