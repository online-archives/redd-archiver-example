When 40 babies were beheaded by Hamas and a few days passed and I questioned the if the story was true I got banned. I also mentioned several Israeli ministers saying favorable things about Hamas like how they were an asset and that got me banned. No warning no explanation.

    <div class="md">Check, check, check, aaand check. Lol. To be honest, twoXchromosomes hurt a little. That was the first sub I was banned from and I contributed a fair bit to it back before it became a toxic cesspool of misandry. I was even awarded reddit gold in that sub. 

I got to watch it's slow decent into toxicity and was finally banned for a seemingly benign comment. I asked what rule it broke and they said it didn't matter because I clearly don't respect women. When I asked why they thought that I was muted. Probably just caught her attention at the wrong time of the month or something. 🤷‍♂️</div>

    <div class="md">Here is what I said that got me banned 

 

Do you have evidence that babies were beheaded?
Wasn’t this an Israeli claim and I’ve yet to see any evidence.
Also Hamas is terrible they killed children it doesn’t matter if they were beheaded or not. They purposely went out to kill innocent people. Terrible inexcusable pieces of shit.
So why did the Israeli minister of finance say Hamas was an asset?
Why did the current prime minister of Israel say we should let Hamas receive funds so there isn’t a two state solution?
I mean there are some of the highest people in government and one of them called a terrorist organization an asset and the other basically said the same.
Why should i trust a government run by people who think terrorists are assets?


Just a rundown because this was a while ago 

40 babies were not beheaded. 

It honestly doesn’t even matter in the grand scheme of things because Hamas still killed children, women, and innocent people. I don’t like false claims and I asked for evidence and that got me banned. Turns out I was right for asking and it never happened. You don’t need to lie about OCT 7th to talk about how horrific it was the 1200 dead speaks for itself and each of them had a story. Rather than sharing their stories we had hyperboles with false information distracting from the story. 

I also claimed that Israeli officials said Hamas was an asset and this was before it was widely reported on a few weeks after the attack. 

Again I was right. I could provide evidence if anyone wants but simply search Israeli finance minister Hamas is an asset and it’s right there. 

Nothing I said was wrong 

Nothing I said was anti-Semitic 

Right wing Israeli government doesn’t represent all of Israel ask the families of hostages or people who protested every Saturday before OCT 7th</div>

    <div class="md">What's your goal with all this?

Ok, some of the stories about Oct 7 weren't true. The vast majority were. Why the need to argue this? What does it achieve?

Again, yes, Bibi and others have allowed Hamas to exist, turning a blind eye to Qatar's funding. What purpose does this serve pointing this out? It was a bad plan and Hamas should have been dealt with sooner; it wasn't. It doesn't change the fact that Hamas are the ones bent on genocide, or Iran are the ones funding and pushing it. 

>Right wing Israeli government doesn’t represent all of Israel ask the families of hostages or people who protested every Saturday before OCT 7th

What is this supposed to mean? 

Honestly, I think I see why the mods banned you. You aren't wrong, but that doesn't mean your goal isn't to stir up shit.</div>

    <div class="md">My comment was a response to someone else it’s hard to remember the exact context cause again this was a while ago. 

But let me add some context. 

When there were first reports of 40 babies being beheaded I believed it. I even have comments I’ve made on Reddit to show I believed it and can link it here if asked. After a few days passed and there was no evidence of this happening and I saw someone else repeat the claim I responded asking for evidence cause at this point I had become skeptical.

Now explain to me how asking for evidence on a claim we now know is false is shit steering? Would’ve said the same thing about the bombing of that hospital? When that happened I said the same thing we should wait for evidence and it turns out I was right there too. 

Why do you think the claim was made if it was false? Why did people need to lie? We both agree OCT 7th was horrific why do you think they needed to add 40 babies were beheaded?

Again my comment was a response to someone else and explaining how we got to the situation we are currently in.</div>

    <div class="md">Saying you saw beheaded babies and there is no beheaded babies is a lie. 

You claim you saw something that you didn’t see that’s the definition of a lie. 

1. I don’t have an agenda but let’s for a moment I did. So what? Everyone has biases based on how they grew up; where they live and their understanding of the world. 

If I said this 40 babies beheaded babies last week and brought it up I would agree it’s distasteful. We’ve moved on as a society and there really isn’t any reason to bring it up. 

That’s not what happened. I brought this up a few days after the incident in a response to someone making that as we all know false statement. 

Netanyahu turning a blind eye to Hamas or Israeli finance minister calling Hamas an asset was not widely public knowledge when I said it. Even if I brought it up today it’s still relevant. It shows how the current leader in charge thinks about situations. Bringing up a politicians past statements is 100% valid. 


Either way all this is irrelevant. 

What you’re saying is if someone says something that doesn’t fit your narrative “ they’re starting shit” and they need to be censored. You want to live in your own bubble. 

This whole sub is about Reddit censoring people 

I didn’t insult anyone 

I didn’t say anything that was untrue 

I didn’t break any rules 


Just because you don’t like what I have to say shouldn’t mean you should get banned from a sub. You have very authoritarian views if that’s how you think society should function or a subreddit called world news. 

It’s different if I went to the Israeli sub and said all this that’s actually stirring shit and distasteful. 


Going on world news subreddit should be a neutral ground for people to speak their mind. As long as it isn’t hateful; spamming, or spreading egregious falsehoods it should stay.</div>

    <div class="md">1.There is no real difference between killing 5.9 million Jews in the holocaust or 6 million Jews in the holocaust. Or 9 million or 4 million. The number is so large and catastrophic it shouldn’t change how anyone feels about the situation. 

2. This goes back to what I said “ Also Hamas is terrible they killed children it doesn’t matter if they were beheaded or not.” It doesn’t change that Hamas went out and searched to kill innocent people including children. It shouldn’t change how you feel about the situation. 

3. I am glad you mentioned “going around telling Jews” again I am Jewish and I would never go to my synagogue saying this shit. I would never go to the Israeli sub and say any of this because there is no point in bringing it up. It would be tasteless and yes make me a douche. 

I didn’t do that I went on WORLD NEWS SUB how is that going to Jews? Unless you’re saying WorldNews is an Israeli subreddit or Jewish subreddit I wasn’t going to Israelis or Jews. 

There is a place and time for everything 

The worldnews subreddit is the perfect place to talk about Netanyahu and his right wing government boosting up Hamas. 

It’s the perfect place to question statements by world leaders of any country or question any organization. Nobody should be above questioning. 

Again it’s WORLD NEWS maybe they should change the sub to pro-Israel sub cause that’s what it’s become. Ever since I was banned I still occasionally scroll on there and check comments and you can see the Israeli bent. 

You are pro-censorship 

I am anti-censorship 

It’s that simple we can agree to disagree</div>

    <div class="md">So you know, Reddit is an echo chamber. A lot of people don’t have very much logic on here, and anything involving Hamas in a critical tone is going to get a lot of pushback.

Why? Because a lot of Redditors are young, young enough to not have a grasp on this stuff, don’t have a lot of common sense, and learn the vast majority of what they need to know in condensed clips on TikTok.</div>

    <div class="md">You don’t understand the word genocide. Half of it is intent. 

A great example of genocide is Hamas flying paragliders into a concert for no other purpose than to kill civilians. 

Hamas intentionally hiding in a hosptial and getting bombed is not genocide, as the intention is to kill the terrorists. It’s also the terrorists (Hamas) trying to hide in civilian areas to prevent them from getting killed.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah that literally defines a genocide that Hamas is commuting... Intent is half the battle. If you intend togo in and murder innocent civilians, and you do, that’s a genocide. 

Part of the problem with Hamas, is they like hiding in hospitals, schools, pretty much anywhere large groups of innocent civilians are, the unfortunate part of that is that when they are located innocent people die. 

If you want a free Palestine you need to get rid of Hamas. Hamas literally has a history of genocide</div>

    <div class="md">Listen dude your justifying atrocities this is why I have zero respect for you and care for whatever bullshit that spews out of your nasty ass mouth. Hamas killed 600~ civilians and 300~ combatants. Civilians will die in war, I dont disagree. Now let me explain the differences, IDF is supposed go be this mighty and powerful army funded and supported by all of the west. Hamas is a militia group funded by iran. You think the civilian death toll is justifiable from the IDF? IDF has killed 27k+ gazans and around 6k hamas. I believe Hamas to be more moral for this reason alone.</div>

    <div class="md">I’m stating facts. Hamas indented todo nothing more than kill civilians. Israel is killing Hamas, and Hamas is using innocent civilians as cover.

    <div class="md">The insults wasn’t directed at you I am speaking about the overall conversation 

And although you didn’t “insult” anyone going after someone’s age instead of their argument is an ad-hominem. 

The other user definitely threw a lot more insults and harsh words.

Again the point is this conversation between you two is how r/worldnews should look instead it’s an echo chamber because they don’t allow a discussion</div>

    <div class="md">I find the "white guilt" towards Israel to be absolutely mind boggling. Yes, the holocaust was bad, but the people who did it were punished and long dead. The mentality that we can never criticize the Israeli government because "80 years ago some Germans did bad things" is just absurd. No one is above criticism. </div>

    <div class="md">Dude, all it took for me to get banned was the say that an article from [Jewishpress.com](http://jewishpress.com) might be a little bit biased putting out an article saying that children and women are combatants and that it is ok to kill them.  Like jesus fuck how is it controversial to say that a source with Jewish in the name might be a bit biased regarding an ongoing war in Israel?  Especially when that article is essentially justifying the deaths of children?  Also caught a 3 day suspension from the site for trying to appeal, they reported me for harassment.  Worldnews is horrible.</div>

    <div class="md">Can someone explain what “ start something” means in this context? This is the second time someone has said this to me. 

Where did I specifically start something? 

Are you starting something by commenting on my post? 

I don’t think so personally. So just explain why my post is starting something but your comment is not?</div>
