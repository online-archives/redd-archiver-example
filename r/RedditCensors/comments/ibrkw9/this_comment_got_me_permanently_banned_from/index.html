    <div class="md">And a perma-ban nonetheless. I’m not sure how that incites violence. A few people reached out and got banned from the same post. Maybe they have a new mod in the past few months but I’ve never been banned from a fuckin subreddit in 3 years. Suddenly in the last month, two in a row... both from r/politics. Something has changed over there.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, the thing that changed is we're getting closer to the election and they don't want to give any ideas to wackos. I don't agree with the permaban, but it's naive to say dragging him out would not be a violent act.</div>

The thing is political turmoil and upheaval is 100% always violent, The matters at stake are by definition: "Life and Death". Why don't you ask Gaddafi how ousted dictator's get treated. It's a death-sentence, the "dragging" is just the transportation to the execution chambers.</div>

    <div class="md">1) I’m a billion percent sure rightwingers will invent a million reasons why Trump had the election stolen from him. He’s doing it himself, right now, saying the only way he loses is if it’s rigged. Insanity. 

2) rightwingers talking about echo chambers is absurd. I’ve never been banned faster than when challenging the narrative on rightwing subs. Only goodthinking is allowed, and as little as possible.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;BuT HiLLaRy WoN THe PoPuLAr VoTe.

I didn't say one word about Clinton. She also conceded the election - she didn't scream out to her voters that the election had been stolen from her, as Trump is already admitting he'll do. 

Why do the Clintons live rent free inside your head?

&gt;You've just described exactly what we experience in the left wingers subs. If not threats of worse. So, what do we do about this little conundrum, hmmm?

We focus on the issue: The sitting president is saying he won't accept a lost election, is talking about running a 3rd term in spite of a little thing called the constitution, and - perhaps most frightening - his supporters are lapping it up. A worrying amount of rightwingers will not accept dissension on the subject of actual fucking fascism.

I think that's a slightly bigger issue than "I get banned for spamming 13/50 memes on leftwing subs :(", don't you?

Conundrum solved.

""Now they need that money in order to have the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” he continued. “By the way, those are just two items, but if they don't get those two items that means you can't have universal mail-in voting.""</div>

    <div class="md">No.  The actual issue is the fact the each side has a hatred... face it, it's what it is... for the other.  Beyond the jackassery of elected leaders of BOTH SIDES is the fact that we have lefties who want us killed, beaten, freaking gulagged for having a different opinion of how the country should be run.  

And no, I'm not talking about just getting banned for a few memes. I'm talking about calls to actual violence for our very existence.  I'm infuriated by that.  

Of course Trump isn't going to get a third term. You and I both know it.  But for every point that you want to bring up about something he said or did,  I can bring up something the left either said or did.   

He's been nothing but attacked by the media from day one,  while those on the left get a free pass for much worse.  So now, I don't blame him for saying just anything. The media and the left lose their shit every time. And after calls to personal violence, we enjoy the left's reaction very much. 

But the problem at the heart is two sides of a population stewing hatred for each other.  That is the conundrum.  

Now,  how shall we get past this?

Edit: We all know damned well the left will do everything they can to steal the election ala Broward County or illegals voting multiple times.  And of course, you'll argue the right will try to steal it, and I will call bullshit... and around and around we go.</div>

    <div class="md">Just like the French Noblesse, they "deserved" to have their head cut off.

Funny facts about the French revolution, there were way more non Nobles who had their head cut off than people from the Noblesse. The persons in charge took the opportunity to also cut the head of anybody not agreeing with them and felt in their rights because they obviously were fighting evil...

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror

As a French, who loves studying history, what I see right now in the US from the left deeming the right evil, I suspect the minute the left win back any power, you'll have your own "Reign of Terror"... If Biden wins, every right wing politics and activists will have their head cut off (metaphorically, I suspect more of a reeducation camp style of punishment).</div>

    <div class="md">The comment can easily be interpreted as inciting violence, which is against Reddit sitewide ToS.

The surprising part is that they actually banned you for it...usually comments like that in that sub, especially when directed at Trump, are ignored.

Don't get me wrong, I don't agree with most forms of censorship either, but in this case I don't totally deny that it was justified.</div>

It is beyond absurd you were banned for that.

Fuck Reddit.  First time I've logged in in a few weeks.  I'm out again.

    <div class="md">Words are harassment. Violence is exercised. Harassment is a form of intimidation or abuse, which in some cases leads to violence. The only thing the "radical left" want to "censor" is harassment and being factually incorrect.

Try to wrap your head around the fact that Trump may be doing illegal and unethical things, and he has even confessed to doing such things. Further, think about what weight his words as POTUS carry. Should we really not take what Trump says seriously? If he's advocating for a third term should we be complacent, and let him strip our democratic republic?   
I believe OP's post was patriotic in that it seeks to enforce the standard of a two term presidency, and while it wasn't specifically advocating for violence, the likely outcome of attempting to "drag him out" would be violent. There are at least three other ways to get a would be dictator/autocrat out of the POTUS before it would come to a citizens arrest type of situation.</div>

    <div class="md">Thank you. Im honestly blown away that this has received so much backlash and downvotes. Like I’m a proud American and was raised in a military right wing family. While many of them have passed on, the core principles of the US are deeply ingrained in me. To speak out against legitimate concerns over treasonous behavior, especially by a president, is what you are SUPPOSED to do as an America.</div>

    <div class="md">Hahahaha doesn't describe me at all. I'm not for hate speech censorship and in most cases violence is not ok. Nice try though.
But actual violence its justified in cases of war</div>
