    <div class="md">I just tried reposting it and it was autoremoved so that means one of the words in the title is on their spam filter. (The +1 67% you got must be from us or their mods) What's interesting about that is that there really is no justification for putting anything in that title on the spam filter. For example, while "favorite alternatives" might be a good one to dispel threats to main reddit's monopoly, it'll cause them to run into many problems as people get filtered for asking things like "favorite alternatives to mcdonalds?" I'm going to try and figure out what they have spam filtered and I'll update in this comment:

* Tried removing 'groupthink' and it was still autoremoved

* 'bots' isn't the word

* not 'subreddits'

* not 'crybullies'

* Removing everything after 'daily activity' still gets autoremoved so it's the first half 

* ok so "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink?" doesn't get autoremoved but "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink have less power, there's lots of daily activity?" does, going to see if "daily activity" is the spam filtered

* "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink have less power?" is autoremoved so it might be "have less power"

* "Have less power?" gets autoremoved for being too short

* "What are your favorite alternatives to the big subreddits where crybullies and the reddit groupthink hav3 les5 pow3r?" isn't autoremoved confirming that "have less power" is filtered</div>
