Rules 2, 6, and 8. 

They don't control other subreddits. They are interfering with Reddit communities by banning potential redditors from joining.  

They didn't state in their rules you can't participate in that reddit. 

They are interfering with regular use of Reddit. I signed up for Reddit, I should be able to go into any subreddit freely. Who are they to decide what I do on reddit outside their subreddit?</div>
