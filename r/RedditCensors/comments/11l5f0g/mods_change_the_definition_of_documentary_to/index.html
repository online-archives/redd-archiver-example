    <div class="md">Interesting bootlickers like you can only giver personal attacks and never actually debate honest intellectuals like me.  You might as well give up while your ahead since I actually have over an Ivy League P.H.D and losers like you can't compete.

You can start however by learning the definition of documentary:

**a film or television or radio program that gives information about a subject and is based on facts:**

You see words have real meanings in the actual world.  Those meanings are defined by definitions which are precisely denotated in any dictionary.  The meaning of words cannot be changed because they are meant to be precise and denote concrete ideas which cannot be changed.  And since words have meanings, bootlickers and propagandists cannot actually change the meanings of words any time they want.  The meaning of words gives an inherent form to the openness of physical, philosophical, and metaphysical reality which means that words must be used for there intended purpose's and not have there definition's changed to suit evil regimes.

Also, since it is a fact that china is evil, and a fact that they are polluters, and a fact that they lie about it this is actually a documentary and every single video on there channel is a documentary.  Now let us contrast the facts and realities told in the documentaries in there channel with the propaganda of the CCP.  China is more at home with lies than with the truth. That, in itself, means that any statement put out by China even when superficially true is nothing but an attempt (a poor one at that) at verbal slight of hand.  

I cannot emphasize enough how much I resent the evil, racist, genocidal, terrorist, CCP's fibs. One doesn’t ven need a finely developed sense of irony to note that over time, China’s taunts have progressed from being merely cynical to being supercynical, hypercynical, and recently ultracynical. In fact, I’d say that now they’re even megacynical. Sometimes I think that I personally question the historicity of the events that China claims have forced it to throw us into a heads I win, tails you lose situation.

I challenge you to prove any one of there fact's wrong but I know you're not going to because you're a bootlicker.</div>

    <div class="md">Did you ever think that the deadly Wuhan CCP Virus that they unleashed into the world killing millions (if not billions) is unhealthy?

Did you ever think that the air pollution that comes from china is unhealthy?

Did you ever think that their inferior, exploding, lead laced products is unhealthy?

Did you ever also think that it is China that wants the war and not the Civilized Western World?  They are free to try and start one but hopefully it will be the Civilized Western World that ends not just the war but the evil racist, fascist, terrorist, genocidal CCP.</div>

    <div class="md">Nope, too busy worrying about the horrific crimes my own country commits. I can actually do something about what's happening within our own borders so I let that be priority. If the US is okay with poisoning it's citizens(East Palestine, Ohio for example) and putting the reporters covering it on a terrorist watch list(Erin Brockovich for example). I'd say we have plenty to be mad about and focus on within our borders before we start policing foreign governments.</div>

Reported for personal attack.  I've only stated provable, truthful factual realities while you rely on propaganda, appeal to emotion, and dishonest wordplay.  Try harder next time Winnie</div>

    <div class="md">Cry harder snowflake. Can't wait to see your next post about being censored like the uneducated, brainwashed little bitch you are. You don't care about real censorship like the manufactured consent our media participates in. All you care about is spreading your little messages of hate that no one in person will ever actually hear out. Terminally online braindead bootlicking fascist prick.</div>
