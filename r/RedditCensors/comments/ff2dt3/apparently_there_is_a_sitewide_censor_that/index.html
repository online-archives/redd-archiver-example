The comment below mine is a moderator of the sub who couldn't figure out what happened.  It was not deleted by the mods of the sub.  But it looks like it was on the archive sites... which is how I discovered this sub.  :)

I know the site-wide censor also blocks domains such as BitChute, but those can be unblocked in Automod.  Can crimethink no-no words be unblocked too?  Or was the comment and others like it deleted by some sitewide supermod?</div>

Is it bad that I can't see any nono words in your post? It almost seems like there are admins browsing who didn't like your context and sniped it from the database.

    <div class="md">Wow I kind of bone-headed it then.   I did a [search on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/search?q=todayifoundout.com&amp;include_over_18=on) and saw a bunch of results, but I didn't pay attention that they were 4 years ago!

Thank you so much.

*edit no... One month ago is the most recent visible link.  I'm just ditzy today.</div>
