    <div class="md">A personal favorite example of some serious wrongthink:

https://i.imgur.com/qtcIdqL.jpg

Further wrong think: 

"I don't think that doctors should have to respect the delusion that someone with XY chromosomes is a female when every test available tells him that he is male.". 

"Many people, including Doctors, believe the gender dysphoria should be treated with counseling, medicine and mental assessments instead of physical surgeries.".

"A 6 foot tall bearded man isn’t a woman tho..so..".

"But like in medical school pretty sure they learned biologically there is only two sexes soooo".

Screw the religion angle, just go straight up to the biological chromosomal understanding.

"People can identify as whatever they like, but a trans person is simply not the same biologically and cannot function as whatever sex they identify with but in fact are not by nature.

I don't use them either, but I don't hang out with a bunch of self important fools who think they are important because of some fucking weird ass reasons around what they identify as.

I'll go to my grave knowing the that problem is extending from the minds that insist I pretend boys are girls and girls are boys and despite all of nature being in a binary state, somehow us fucking primates are different.

Fuck of with that please and thanks."

All of the above comments were censored away by the mods. What an absolute pack of fucks.</div>

    <div class="md">Too many of these trans people just need attention and a social space to belong to. 


Not only 2 minutes ago I filled out a medical questionnaire form regarding a biometric screening. There were two options for gender. Male and Female. 

They remind me of vegans or crossfitters. 

me: hey, you seen the new Lego movie? 

Them: as a trans.. I..

me: never mind

-----------------

me: I recently got into an adult soccer league, having a blast

them: before I was a vegan, I tried but didnt like it, now as a vegan, I'd give it a shot. beans.</div>

https://www.who.int/gender-equity-rights/understanding/gender-definition/en/

"Gender refers to the socially constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles and relationships of and between groups of women and men. It varies from society to society and can be changed. While most people are born either male or female, they are taught appropriate norms and behaviours – including how they should interact with others of the same or opposite sex within households, communities and work places."</div>

    <div class="md">So you have no source for your stance? I can go and post other sources but it doesn't sound like you'd care 

There's been a very clear difference in how the terms gender and sex are used in the past 5 years. Heck people still think sex is a completely binary thing and ignore the existence of intersex people because they never discovered things like having 3 X chromosomes is a thing.

Just because you are failing to grasp basic ideas around sex and gender doesn't mean you're right</div>

    <div class="md">I literally post stuff from world leading groups like WHO and you do the whole "facts don't care about your feelings" like cmon

And calling everything that isn't the norm a defect is pretty dumb as well. Intersex etc. are different sexes to male and female. If you can't grasp gender identity then wow you're screwed seeing as fairly old journals have already clearly explained it with the terms "sex", "sex category" and "gender" which are well defined. You can see it is one of the most heavily referenced journals on the topic of sex and gender but it's referenced elsewhere as well as it's methodology and logic is quite good and clear.

    <div class="md">You're going to continue to pretend WHO can never be wrong. Must be fun living in fantasy land. 

Something 1.7% of the population has that is a birth defect isnt a new sex. 

Intersex conditions are sometimes also referred to as disorders of sexual development (DSDs). Such conditions are extremely rare in humans.

Calling something that wasnt designed to happen and only happens in a defect of genetic code is a birth defect. 

birth de·fect

noun

a physical or biochemical abnormality that is present at birth and that may be inherited or the result of environmental influence.

Of look at that a birthdefect is an abnormality. 1.7% is an abnormality present at birth i.e birth defect.
