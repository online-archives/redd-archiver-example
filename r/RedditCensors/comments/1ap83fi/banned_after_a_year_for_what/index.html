    <div class="md">For context the thread was talking about a few different movies and shows and I said "I haven't watched star wars, but that's what other people say" and then talked about High Guardian Spice and it's awful writing and why it was awful and how it could have been fixed, but the writers didn't care.

So, I didn't complain about a movie I hadn't watched, none of the things I posted broke any rules, nor was I complaining about anything other than bad writing in a show?

And somehow this person went back way over a year to ban me for something not harmful. My guess is they actually liked High Guardian spice or some shit.</div>

    <div class="md">It was an American made "anime" that was painfully mediocre, poorly written that leaned heavily on LGBT representation to give it's characters personality.

And it was created by Crunchyroll, an anime streaming service as an original program when the vast majority of it's subscribers would have preferred them to have used that money to license or dub an actual anime.</div>

    <div class="md">I could give a lot of a reviews on it, as well as I wrote a 'fixed script' to try fixing the problems the show had.  


but the first problem was the world building.>! It had very little. For instance, they make a point that there's old magic (conservative republican) and new magic (democratic progressive) but didn't actually say what was different about them, they just arbitrarily decided "someone used old magic" and nobody viewing it understands why it's old magic vs new magic. Also old vs new magic was a lazy way to describe it. My fix here would have been old magic could have been something like Evocation where it required an oral component  and took too long, but while it took longer, the effects were better and new magic used arcana type magic assisted tools (staffs, magic globes, etc.) to create faster, near instantaneous magic but the effects of were less because of how much quicker the spells were to use, but make it a plot point that the speed came with another drawback such as taking mana from the air and plant nearby them so it would slowly decay the world. (There was a plot point about the Rot killing off the land, but we know nothing about it because while it was stated to be a central antagonistic plot, nothing was ever done with it).
!<

>!The second are the characters and hypocrisy. For instance, Rosemary is loud, obnoxious and completely self absorbed. So it's quirky and a fun! But she falls in love with a guy who is very much the same, and then he becomes a villain just because he has the same personality she has but is man, so now let's abuse men for doing the same thing a girl did. And by that I mean lots of physical assault. Rosemary also treats her sword like a toy, but nothing bad ever really comes from that, and she's supposed to be a 'warrior' type but is totally untrained so it makes it completely ridiculous just because her mama was some legendary swordswoman who never trained her.
!<

>!the lgbt issues were so saturated in this without making it relevant to the world it was kind of cringeworthy. And I say this 'as a gay'. When they drop the trans bombs, it's so unnatural. When they talk about lesbians, it's so forced and they also do it for the viewers because the characters who they're explaining they're trans/lesbian to don't react to it at all. The second trans (possibly) character Snapdragon could have been done well with his battle for identity between masculine and feminine, but the only thing we got from this was "maybe" and "bullied by toxic masculinity"
!<

>!The only character really done well was  Amaryllis who was designed to be a minor villain and we were supposed to hate her, except hatewatchers and fans alike actually loved Amaryllis (Crazy Axe murder Girl if you google it)!<  


basically... yeah, a lot of problems. and Genericusername went over some of it, but the show itself was controversial even before because crunchy roll asked for donations for JAPANESE animation studios and people donated a lot of money, but instead gave the money to a small studio of white girls who banked on being 'diverse' despite being only white girls  who were very much overpaid to make this shitty show and people wanted their money back because crunchyroll DID say it was going to go to Japanese animators. Not worthless flash students.</div>

    <div class="md">Viable alternative would be allowing moderators from both sides of the spectrum (less and more censorship) to be able to have a quorum on decisions but instead its power hungry losers who were picked on in school, now abusing their powers.

Being able to get muted from messaging a moderator, but not being able to see who it is you’re messaging, is the most lopsided nonsense period.

This whole system exists in a fantasy world where moderators would be perfectly impartial, which we know is practically impossible when dealing with humans.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't even want to call them liberal because a true liberal wouldn't behave like this.

this is closer to leftist totalitarianism where if you don't believe what they say unquestioningly and in the right order of words, it is to be destroyed. Or banned in this case.</div>
