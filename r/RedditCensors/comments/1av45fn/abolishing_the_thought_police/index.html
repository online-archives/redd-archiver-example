      <div class="md">So, reddit and all other online communication forums these days follow a hierarchical structure of power, rather than a non hierarchical structure of power. Hierarchies where someone lays down the rules to someone else are the simplest form of power exercise. They also tend to be autocratic, and resemble the military more than actual civilian power. 

In civil exercises of power, there is a process. There are courts, there are juries, and although there are police, if the police act badly, they are punished for doing so (in most civilized countries, america, communist china, and totalitarian russia are outliers here). 

This post is to spread awareness about an idea. A different way to perform online content moderation that does not involve moderators, but instead involves a process. In the real world this would be called a legal process, and using the word algorithm isn't the right word either, because humans must be involved. But it is a court process for finding wrongdoing in posting, and properly moderating it. 

So, for starters there must be a way for people to put up a wager they can lose. I am going to use money in this example, simply because its the thing most people are familiar with and want. However money can be replaced by MANY other things. For example, tokens that allow you to post a certain number of times per day that you get from the site, or perhaps tokens that you can display as a social status or something. The point here is that people should want to aquire more of these things, because that is the incentive structure the entire idea is based on. 

So, lets say someone finds a post that is offensive. For example, a person using the N word. Now, they can put up a wager saying this content is offensive. For three days, the person who posted it will be notified their content was posted as being offensive, and unless they put up a wager of their own saying that the content is not offensive, the content will be taken down in 3 days. No bans as of yet. 

But let's say a person fights back, and says the content is not worthy of being token down? Well, they have both put up wagers (lets say $5 each) Now there is $10 in the pot. So three random people are selected, and they have the opportunity to review the case. They can vote that its takedown worthy, or not takedown worthy. 

Now, the 3 people who are voting have their own rules. If they vote in the majority, they get a percentage of the payout. If they vote in the minority, they get nothing. So a person who is profit driven will be incentivized to vote how they think the other 2 people in the group will vote. However, they have no way to collude with them, its randomly selected, first come, first serve jury pools. 

The people in the jury get to split $3 worth of the money, divided by how they voted. 

The winner gets to take home $1 in addition to the original amount he wagered. That is a 20% return on investment for a few minutes worth of work. You could easily end up making $7-$8 per hour flagging bad content if the wager size was only $10. 

The platform takes home $1 as well. This ensures that this is profitable to keep running for the platform. 

The end user who incorrectly argued for content to remain up or be taken down would end up losing the $5 they posted. 

Now, I used money here as an EXAMPLE. It does not have to be money. Especially for people who want to use this as social commentary as poverty, please understand that as i said before in the preface, there are many other standins for money that could be used here. 

The point is that no one person gets to mod anymore. The entire community mods itself. And if the mods do have to step in they can penalize people who voted as a group as something being not ban worthy if it broke the sitewide rules. Perhaps take away their voting priveledges on jury duty for a few months. Idk. The point here is to not have a power tripping mod. Some people will probably come running saying that this is a crypto usecase, or that its not fair, or whatever. its not about any of that. If you are a poor person with no money, you could make minimum wage by doing jury duty on this platform. If your a rich douche spouting off horrible shit, you would lose money on this, and end up being annoyed your content got taken down. Its not about how much money a person has, its about if they are posting content that is ok. That is all. Pls and ty. 

Also, I have feelings too, so pls be nice to my idea? Don't bash before reading and understanding the entire setup? pls? </div>
