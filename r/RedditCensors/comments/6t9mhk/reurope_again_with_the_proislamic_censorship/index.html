      <div class="md">A highly upvoted and gilded comment of mine just disappeared with a bunch of others. Mods didn't notify the posters nor provided for an explanation when asked for one.

The post was about European attitudes when someone's children dated an Asian/Jew/Muslim/Black person

How my comment appears for me [normally vs incognito mode](http://i.imgur.com/DXpOQ4C.jpg?1)

----------------------------------------------

And here is how I asked for an explanation:

------------------

A comment of mine was just removed, what rule did it break?

In a submission discussing different groups of people it linked to a 200 page study and gave a fact

I'd guess that the 2 rules that can be used to remove this are

A: Pushing an agenda (which is false, I was literally advocating for individualism and arguing against somebody judging people by the color of their skin when you removed my post)

or

B: Racism. Which again, is false. The way the question is framed the only information given are ethnic groups "Would you be confortable if your child was in a relationship with (Black/Asian/Muslim/Jew)". When we speak about groups we have to speak in terms of group statistics, it is just not possible to write a paragraph for every individual. This in no way advocates for collectivism or the judging of individuals based on their origin traits which they cannot change (that would be unethical and racism/sexism etc). So why was my high-upvoted and gilded comment removed? Are we banned from speaking about groups in general or just speaking about some statistics of some groups in particular?

This is the correct answer when 90% of world muslims answer "yes" to the question "[Should a wife always obey her husband](http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf)"
