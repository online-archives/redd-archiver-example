    <div class="md">&gt;All across the world, in every society ever, men do the heaviest work, perform the most dangerous jobs, provide most of the financial responsibilities for their families, defend against danger, are expected to be leaders, and are the most expendable when it comes to surviving tragedies and wars.

&gt;When a man loses all purpose in life, it has serious consequences. There's a lot of pressure put on boys that our society tends actively to downplay, and I think it's a tragedy that even acknowledging these facts will get you attacked, instead of listened to.


Deleted for being hate speech, apparently.



&gt;Add to that much higher unemployment rates ,not doing as well in school and IMHO we are doing a great disservice to young men/boys right now that I am afraid are going to have bad outcomes in the long run


Deleted as hate speech


&gt;Men are also never expected to look vulnerable since it looks weak. We as a society need to accept that men can be vulnerable, and can cry and be sad.


Deleted by mods


&gt;Men have always had higher suicide rates, as well as workplace deaths, homicides.

&gt;We just have it too easy in life.
