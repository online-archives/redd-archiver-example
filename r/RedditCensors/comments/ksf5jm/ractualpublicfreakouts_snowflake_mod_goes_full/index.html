Will update you soon. I upvoted the post in the meantime as it was sitting at 50%

Edit: Didn't take long. Checked the logs. You apparently said this. 

"A bunch of fucking n-word. Yes n-word. Worst shit of the worst."

    <div class="md">Literally 1 hour ago you called people morons and dumb fucks. Which is fine, it's about context and APF is one of (or so I thought) last few places on reddit where people can vent a bit.

Back on topic though, the mod didn't like that I pointed to him that APF is turning into another left leaning PF and he went ahead to search half a year back my post history to find a reason to ban and mute me, which is exactly what people would expect from a PF mod, not a APF mod, proving the point I made.

All in all, I'd appreciate if this was reversed, I've been on reddit for about 10 years and should be excused a slip once in a while.</div>

    <div class="md">God. Just now seeing this. You can't be serious, right?

You were banned 4 months ago for the obviously racist commentary above. 

You then requested an unban, a new mod changed your perma-ban to a temp ban, and you went right back on making racist comments.

If there ever was complete justification to ban, it's you and this situation. You're never getting unbanned. Why? Being a racist POS.

    <div class="md">beethy don't let that antifa soyboy gaslight you into thinking I'm whatever trigger word those lefties like calling right-wing patriots (Even though I'm centrist, but that's the new right in 2021).
He is without a doubt one of those who subscribe to jezebel to stay updated on what words someone can and cannot use to shallow-mindedly cancel them no matter context without realizing the hypocrisy of his thought policing vs actual reality.

I hope you reconsider letting him walk all over you like that, there is enough of his kind destroying all subs, please don't let APF turn into one more of those controlled by his sjw kind.

I've already told you that I understand your position on having to be careful not to lose the sub and that I would mind my words better, don't pre-emptively lose your sub in *that* way. I got a 10 years old account, I've apologized, no need to perma-ban skipping all warning / temp ban etc and behave like a nazi or something by doing so.</div>
