    <div class="md">The original post: 

First I’d like to start of by thanking the mods for having a place we can post our opinions being they may be unpopular everywhere else on Reddit. I sent proof to verify I am who I say I am. My post comes from a place of love. I feel absolutely powerless in what is happening in this country and I thought I can post my feelings here and hopefully someone can hear me out from a different perspective.

I feel people outside the black race think that we all think alike and share the same beliefs but this is so far from the truth. It’s true that he who shouts the loudest gets the most attention and that is exactly what’s happening in our country at the moment. There’s millions of African Americans that share the same thoughts as me, but we get chewed out or canceled when our thoughts stray from the status quo. There’s many videos of us speaking out against this, but it doesn’t make the news as it goes against the narrative.

A little About Me before I get into it:

I was born and raised in the “hood”. Newark, NJ to be exact. I still live here, not by choice but by necessity.

I AM NOT OPPRESSED!! Yes I still live in the city I grew up in, it’s not the ghetto by any standard but it’s not the suburbs neither. I have my own apartment, a nice car, and good credit. Am I where I want to be in life? No, not even close. But I’m working towards it. Where I’m at right now is 100% my fault and on me. I’m where I’m at in life because of my life choices. Had nothing to do with anyone else of any race, it was me. And have a plan to get where I want to be and there’s no doubt in my mind that I will get there if I put in the work necessary.

I’ve always been treated with respect by the police. To frame this I’m not just a black guy, I’m a very dark black guy. The black community comes in all shades from very fair skinned to very dark skinned. I fall into the darker category. I’ve gotten out of more tickets than I’ve received when being pulled over. I’ve never been to jail. One time I was put in handcuffs because I had a bench warrant because I didn’t pay a tiny ticket I completely forgot about.

These cops were respectful the entire time. They even took me to the atm so I could get money to bail myself out..lol..it was less than $200. They saw I wasn’t a threat and let me out of the handcuffs on the trip to the precinct. When we got there, the officer even apologized and said unfortunately I’d have to put the cuffs back on to walk into the precinct because it was policy. To add my license was suspended because of the unpaid ticket. But these officers drove me back to my vehicle and said “I can’t advise you to drive this car, but once we leave you can do what you want”. This proves treat people with respect you’ll get the same back. They could have towed my car and left me stranded and the precinct. But they drive me all the way back to my car and let me go. And I was definitely far from home in a area that you’d consider predominantly “white” if that’s a thing anyway.

BLM:

I understand that they may have good intentions but they are going about it the wrong way. They are trying to get demands made by force and violence. I feel as though this is not the way to get things done as it’s just going to piss people off even more. Yeah you may get what you want, but it won’t be out of support but it what be out of fear. Fear of being canceled, fear of not being re-elected, fear of losing your job if you speak up against them. America is built on democracy. What I am seeing right now is not a democracy but a dictatorship. If you don’t agree with us then you are DONE. We’re going to cancel you and burn down your business.

The rioting and looting was the dumbest thing to do and should have been condemned by BLM. People say oh the business have insurance they can rebuild. First off, how are people supposed to go grocery shopping etc. if you burned down the businesses in your neighborhood? Secondly, when things like this happen businesses don’t usually come back. I’m from Newark,NJ. Back in the 60’s we had similar riots that lasted for days because of a rumor that a black man was beaten by the police. You can look the story up as it’s still a big event in history. But what I’m getting at is that my city is JUST NOW recovering from an event that happened over 50 years ago. These cities will never be the same, and I don’t mean that in a good way. Jobs will not return and these businesses are gone forever to never return.

I want to be accepted for who I am. Not because the government or BLM said you have to or suffer the consequences. The way they are going about this is causing a bigger racial divide more than ever and is counterproductive in what their trying to achieve.

Dr. Martin Luther King said “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character”.

Black Lives Matter don’t want that. They want special treatment for being born black. I want to get where I am because of my hard work. Not because I had to be hired to hit a “black” quota.

I’m rambling and don’t want to make this too long. But I wanted to get my opinion out there because me and others like me feel our voices are being stifled. And we are afraid to speak up because any deviation of opinion will get us canceled which is not right and makes this country no longer the democracy It used to be.

TLDR: Black lives matter is going about things the wrong way to bring change. I’m black and never felt oppressed because of my race. Things will get worse if we remain on this path.</div>

    <div class="md">Its a good post and i hate censorship so thats for posting it here because i would have missed the orginal. 

He says he is not where he wants to be in life but that it is his fault is where i disagree. His choices were only his because he responded to the environmental stimuli he was exposed to. He didnt choose place of birth, genetics, school (observation of human "normality" in formative years) ect

Its nothing to do with being poor or what race you are.  unimaginably rich teens and young adults can fuck things up  (over doing it on the drugs, geting a yoko whatever) its all just enviroment and we as sentient beings have far less choice than we think.  Obligation is another one - so many consider obligation regarding something like not selling out at the first chance or obligation regarding a pregnancy ect - even the choices people make regarding massive life choices like that is only down to the life they have lived so far, the coversations - environment stimuli they have been exposed to. 

Whether you believe in free will or not those choices and decisions we make are based off our life experiences, genetics, geology and circumstances which we dont choose.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; His choices were only his because he responded to the environmental stimuli he was exposed to

Yeah, just like a dieter responds to the environmental stimuli of a pastry shop by going in and eating an entire cake?

_Oh he couldn't help it.  Had the evil oppressive system not put that damn pastry shop on the corner, that dieter would be thin as a rail!_

This "very dark black guy" grew up in the same exact environment as other black guys, but instead of choosing to be a failure and blaming all these bullshit factors he chose to work and take responsibility.   Nothing is stopping all of those other people from doing the same thing he did except their own choice.</div>

    <div class="md">You might want to look up a fed videos by Thomas Sowell, he has some similar thoughts on the subject (ie.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS5WYp5xmvI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS5WYp5xmvI) ).  While I don't agree with everything he says, there are few people more studied on the subject, or that have a sharper mind.  


But I agree, in that I feel BLM has subverted these situations for their own benefit, and in doing so will do more harm than good in the long run, in particular to blacks.  It takes courage to speak unpopular convictions, I commend you on that.</div>
