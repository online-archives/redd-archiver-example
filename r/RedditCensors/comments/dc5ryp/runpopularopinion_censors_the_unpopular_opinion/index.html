Prior to anyone committing suicide ('roping'), they would often post that they are considering as such, and the user base would always discourage them from doing so and try to talk them out of it. 

This user base was more equipped to do so because they actually understand what the person considering suicide is going through, whereas everywhere else they'd be hit with the same old trope they've heard thousands of times ("take a shower, take up hobbies"). This complete lack of empathy would make them even more lonely. 

Even in an apparent farewell note, people would talk down suicide and strongly urge the victim to soldier on. 

They also shared a grim sense of humour and also made fun of a lot of the stupidity prevailing reddit. It was one of, if not, THE funniest sub on reddit. At least the funniest sub with meta comedy, hands down... Ripe with golden memes and spot on satire.

The sub was also proclaimed to be one of the greatest coping mechanisms ('cope' for short) by the users.

By removing /r/braincels, they removed a great coping mechanism and integral communication channels for suicide prevention. 

Fuck the top of the reddit hierarchy.</div>

You've given myself and others that didn't even know the sub existed, some substance and understanding of the impact.

Well done.

(On a side note, kind of amusing that Reddit would censor an Incel based sub, considering that the Admins are Incels)</div>

    <div class="md">The amount of strawmanning that happened so that certain subreddits could justify bullying them was fucking insane. I did the same thing as you and joined just to observe and from what I saw they were nowhere near as bad as the rest of reddit made them out to be.  There were definitely some really bad people in there but as a whole it was mostly people just grovelling and coping about/with how ugly they were and coming to grips with the cold hard truth about losing the genetic lottery.</div>

The worst part is that IT is still up and running despite them literally driving people to suicide. Take a look at this users history and tell me whether or not he was bullied into killing himself u/uggocel. His farewell post is gone now that braincels was nuked but his posts on IT remain. His rope post specifically mentioned how his interaction with IT drove him to suicide as a result of the harassment he got.</div>

    <div class="md">You forgot to add that it was probably the most diverse subreddit out there

it was such a good cope and a place for people with such similar life experiences. What made it special was that there wasn't much hate as everyone says. No point in hating something if you just don't care any more. Also, it was a lot more vanilla than other similar places on the vastness of internet, just memes with a grain of self loathing. 

I will miss that place</div>

    <div class="md">I remember when the whole banned subreddits thing started.  The official line is it would only be used for the worst of the worst subreddits, anything else would be 'quarantined', only the really unredeemable subs would get banned, and the process would not become expansive or abused.  

Those opposed to banning subs (including myself) said it was too easy for the process to become a common response, that while the admins had the best of intentions there would likely be a slippery slope in the future, and to keep that in check at least there should be an official multi-step process for banning a subreddit (with public input), and there should be a public list of banned subreddits with a stated justification for each one.  Those calls were ignored.  

But that's what happened.  Case in point- /r/gundeals.  When Reddit enacted their anti-gun policy, gundeals was instantly banned.  Only problem is *nobody actually sold any guns on /r/gundeals*, it was just a coupon and deal sub that posted links to other retailers who sold guns and gun accessories.  And as anyone who knows guns knows, you can't sell guns over the Internet, you can only have them shipped to a local gun dealer so you can get a background check before picking it up.  
Not that the admins bothered to investigate any of this.  /r/gundeals was banned, and it was only with a massive community outcry that the admins' attention was gotten and these facts were brought to light.  

As I see it, this is no different.  Easy to ban, hard to do research first.  

Thing is, I get it.  I used to run a sizable online community full of trolls and idiots.  I know how tempting it is to 'lay down the law' and try to make the bad actors behave.  But unfortunately online you have to choose between very strict moderation and tolerating the trolls.  Reddit used to have a good balance- keep the trolls in the troll subs.  Now it seems Reddit would rather push anything they don't like off the platform.  I get it, especially having large corporate backers that want to monetize Reddit.  But it's the wrong call.  

What Reddit really needs is a nonprofit foundation that can operate and monetize Reddit, purely for the benefit of the community.  Sadly the VC owners won't do any such thing anytime soon, as there's no money to be made in that.</div>

    <div class="md">The FBI and normies could care less about their lives. There’s been more than enough discussion on that former sub and many others like it, that men’s lives are expendable, even more so if they’re single.

The whole reason it was removed is because of that stupid “Joker” movie. The FBI made reddit take it down, along with /r/Geekcels, because they’re worried those places are breeding grounds for organizing the supposed mass shootings that the movie is generating. They’ve labeled an entire group of men as potential threats because one or two whack jobs had some mental issues. So now we’re all punished for someone else’s actions.

All this is going to do is create more suicides as you’ve suggested, and more frustration among men.

This is what IncelTears also wanted, they don’t care if men off themselves. It’s cyber bullying, but that’s okay, because normies lives matter, not disenfranchised lonely men.

Yet subs like /r/DolcettKingdom continues to exist, even though it promotes the sexualization, rape, murder and cannibalism of women. But that’s okay for some fucked up reason.

Fucking clown world.</div>

    <div class="md">Rope threads were full of people comforting the OP. But I wouldn't say the sub was trying to discourage people from roping. In a lot of cases, suicide is the answer, and useless platitudes to prevent it is rude and generally unhelpful.

That said, having a sub like that to vent and share experiences and memes did a lot to socialize people who otherwise would have been entirely alone and with no sense of community. And that goes a long way towards preventing suicide.</div>

This site is also heavily moderated. The other site has actual calls to rape and violence. This site is not moderated. These are the two most popular sites for your demographic. You shut down the heavily moderated site. Do you think there's a decent chance that the user base is going to go to the other site and fall deeper in the rabbit hole?</div>

    <div class="md">Gym (I'm fit but not ripped), fashion, ability to socialize (from introverted shy guy to being able to talk to anyone on the street), dabbled in PUA back when it was the hot topic a few years ago, college educated, play an instrument, recorded an album, extensively traveled the world, lived in various countries, joined a bowling league for a bit... all the muh personality and hobby crap didnt make a single bit of difference, theres no gym for your face or height. If i had never done any of that and became an unironic basement dweller there would be absolutely no difference between the two lifestyles. 

All the skills i developed and all the experience i have that makes me an interesting person isnt enough. I could be the most interesting book you ever read but since the cover sucks most people arent going to ever crack it open. You can say "just keep trying bro" but after all this effort how many more times must i do the exact same thing while expecting a different outcome? How much longer do i willingly engage in the definition of insanity before admitting that its fucking over?</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;can you confidently approach hot women on the street?

Ive approached even groups of women. Its always the same response from them: aloof disinterest, gotta suddenly check that phone and avoid returning eye contact, guarded body language, im busy, i have a boyfriend, im a lesbian, theres ALWAYS some excuse. Its not like i go after hot women either, i go after average looking girls mostly since at least theyre closer to my league than a near model girl is. Same shit. Women just dont want short and ugly guys.

&gt;what kind of inner game work did you do?

I havent kept up with pua in ages, what do you mean by inner game?</div>

    <div class="md">If you go after the hottest girls, you'll actually put game theory in your advantage. The super hot girls are already used to being surrounded by good looking people, but most people find super hot girls intimidating and are needy around them. If you got the game to engage them romantically yet with indiffierence to outcome, IMO you have a better chance with them than the average girl. 

Inner game: work on your deep belief system. Using visualisation, different forms of cognitive behavioural therapy, etc.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;bro just date pseudo models, they love 5'8 ugly dudes

Bro come on. Be fucking realistic here. 

&gt;most people find hot girls intimidating 

Its more like they admit to themselves they dont have a chance. Even then there are plenty of guys that shoot their shot but still fail and its not due to a lack of confidence its due to a lack of looks. Its not like i havent done this either, when i learned pua i approached all types of women, fat and ugly to victorias secret models. I shot the shit with random dudes too cause hey, gotta get out of that shell, gotta learn to be social. Guys were chill, smoke a cig and talk a lot of shit about music, events, hidden gems, etc. Girls however were much more guarded and the blackpill explained to me why i failed so much. Trash genes dont get passed on in a world without enforced monogamy, see any animal that operates this way for proof. When women pick they go after the best. When monogamy is the social norm the best have to pick one and remove themselves from the dating pool, constantly shifting the available best down as similar quality men and women shack up. Feminism and free sex will collapse society, were already seeing the mass exodus of men from society in general because why bother if you're not guaranteed a mate?

&gt;use visualization, cognitive behavioral therapy

Just astral project onto another realm of existence and get a universe gf bro.</div>

    <div class="md">Did a beard or other hairstyles do anything for ya? I have to admit that I feel empathy for incels and agree with the logic of the black pill but I just don't want it to be true. Maybe if we didn't live in an age where women can capitalize on their sexual market value so easily then things would be different for incels. FaceAndLMS's video on Women Have Unlimited Dating Options really opened my eyes to this.

Did you ever try going the route of getting jacked? A body type like this for example https://i0.wp.com/moreplatesmoredates.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screenshot_2015-11-04-19-57-16-e1558492829740.png?resize=762%2C1273&amp;ssl=1

Slim waist and big chest like with the Adonis index program.</div>

    <div class="md">Usually it's 
&gt; Some opener

&gt; After 2 minutes or so "I think you're cute and I'd like to get your number"

&gt; polite rejection

Talking to them, it happens multiple times a night if they go out, if they're just walking around on the street maybe one every 2 weeks or so.
None of them have ever gone out with these guys. They tend to just date in their huge social circles.  

Pickup worked when no one did it, because it differentiated yourself from the crowd and no one did it. Unfortunately it became popular in my city 2 or so years ago, so most girls hate being cold approached and talk about it when it becomes especially bad. 

This is disregarding you having something they want. If you do then you're golden.</div>
