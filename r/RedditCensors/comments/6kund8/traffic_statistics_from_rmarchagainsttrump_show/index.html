    <div class="md">The mods in T_D, if anything, are super-diligent at squelching any infringements.  

They need to be, considering the blatant abuse and selective enforcement of nebulous "rules" the admins aim at them specifically.

There are hundreds of other subs used and abused by shady propaganda agencies like ShareBlue &amp; Co, with full admin approval. Botting like this is a cancer on the face of reddit.

Not to mention all the brigading and outright hostile threats that mods and users of T_D recieve, with deafening silence from the admins.

Not long ago some T_D mods publicly called out the admins for their blatant hypocrisy.  Admin response?  Suspended the whistle-blower's accounts. :(

The admins would LOVE to outright ban them, but banning the sub where our POTUS did his AMA would be a public relations *nightmare* for them. Reddit admins already have a well-deserved reputation as rabid left-wing extremists. Banning T_D would create a media shitstorm, shining a glaring light on their extreme bias. This is something that the admins are not willing to face.</div>

Your sourced story is about bots reposting articles from other subs, not about vote manipulation. In that story he specifically states there was no vote manipulation to his knowledge, which is the topic of this post, and I can't imagine he changed his mind in a second admission letter. </div>

    <div class="md">Hm, that's not how correlation and causation works. For instance, the cause might be an influx of users in from all, which could be attributed to good content, that just happens to be missing. The charts seem to suggest otherwise, but data is finnicky like that. Another cause could be that the subreddit had a falling out. 

When he says correlation != causation, he's implying taking a logical stance that you can't just look at every correlation and assume its the cause. To see it so vehemently downvoted makes it clear that people here aren't fans of logic.

It doesn't devalue the correlation at all, merely suggests the correlation be seen as a correlation with the understanding that many factors could have caused it.</div>
