    <div class="md">See I'm totally okay with immigration. Every person in the US is an American and that's all I consider myself as. I think that's the beauty of the US. However, the reason republicans support immigration, in their limited form, is because corporations need low wage workers. That's my main concern. Is the total corruption of our government by business interests. They whittle away our rights and pay us as little as they can to keep us as close to slaves as they can get.</div>

&gt;  If Trump is so horrible, why would democrats vote to give his administration more power? They're ALL fucking liars.

Because he IS a democrat.

Spent his whole life and more fortune than most of us will make in our lives supporting jessie hijackson, al terrorist sharpton and any other leftist that floated up from the septic tank.

What confuses me is how easily the republican party fell for his used car salesman pitch.</div>
