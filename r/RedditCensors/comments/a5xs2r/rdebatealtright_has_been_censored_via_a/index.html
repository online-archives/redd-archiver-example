    <div class="md">&gt;The freedom of speech allows you to say whatever you want, but you can't force others to listen to what you want to say.

I don't advocate forcing anyone to follow your belief. I do advocate everyone having the ability to believe what you believe by your own decision, not by the admins'.

&gt;And the Quarantine isn't preventing these people from conversing with one another.

It's preventing people from seeing something and being able to decide whether or not they agree with that. They won't be allowed to take a side on it. This website has surpassed Google now in popularity. Reddit has become an incredibly important player in how the world thinks and stances the world takes. I mean they're talking about Russians using T_D to win Trump the White House. It's incredibly important that people be allowed to see what they want and decide for themselves to hide something away.

&gt;The "Alt right" isn't going to accomplish anything besides fueling more hate into the hearts of both sides.

Then let them. Let people say what they want to say. Reddit already gives its users all the tools they'll ever need to hide away anything they don't want to see. The admins' censoring away /r/DebateAltRight is an open admission that they disagree with that subreddit's opinions and they're willing to use their positions to ensure no one else gets to hear that opinion, lest they, heaven forbid, agree. </div>

We aren't saying they *can't* do what they're doing, we're saying that what they're doing is wrong and will only serve to deceive people. In a perfect world, everyone would be as outraged as us. No one should be ok with their decisions being made for them to this degree. 

&gt;Nothing is stopping someone from deciding to see search it out and see it

The Reddit admins are indeed doing just this. The only way you'll see /r/DebateAltRight now is by actively seeking it out. But the entire site is designed around a system of voting up what you want to see and people seeing that stuff the most. The admins have no made it so that no matter how many upvotes a post on /r/DebateAltRight may get, it will be invisible unless you specifically seek out the subreddit. That goes against Reddit's entire design.

It's censorship. It's the admins specifically hiding away something so people don't see it. That is censorship. </div>
