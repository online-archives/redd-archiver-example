      <div class="md">Hi all, 

I don't like doing these updates but sometimes they are necessary. 

r/redditcensors as per it's name should be solely about blatant censorship of thought or public news etc.

Really don't want this place to spiral out of control and become another targeted sub like CA (may it rest in peace). 

Memes / Personal Opinion on subjects aren't censorship, unless obviously you were censored somewhere for it. 

There has also been an uprising of people calling out that they are censored when they've gone to a specific sub and purposely went against the grain.. this isn't censorship as we would do the same here as mods. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Final piece, and if you're still reading, please let this be the part you remember. 

Don't get too caught up in all this garbage. Get outside, go play with your kids, hug you cat or dog, say hello to your Mum &amp; Dad etc. 

Being tied *too* far deep into this stuff is not going to help you mentally or physically. Reddit is dead and gone, it has been for some time now. 

Remember, reddit is a mouthpiece for the vocal **minority**, don't get caught in the echo's.

As always, happy to hear your thoughts or questions.</div>

    <div class="md">Been thinking this. I just saw a guy complain about “censorship” because he was calling people trannies on a popular sub. Do people really think it should be okay to post “fuck n*****rs and trannies” all over the place?

    <div class="md">Keeping the subreddit on topic isn’t “censorship”, and you shouldn’t worry about looking “hypocritical” to a bunch of angry 15 year olds who don’t know the first thing about free speech

    <div class="md">Mate, we (Redditcensors) mods didn't remove any video from this sub. 

You need to be messaging the Reddit admins or the mods of r/videos to find out why. 

The one reason I can give you from my point of view is that they're worried about offending their Chinese owners (overlords).

If the post from r/Redditcensors has been deleted it DEFINITELY was not us.</div>
