&gt;Hello, just curious why my comments were removed https://np.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/x7nfgd/hillary_at_it_again/indr29a and https://np.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/x7nfgd/hillary_at_it_again/inds203, what rules did I violate to warrant their removal? I have multiple other users being rude to me and launching person attacks and their comments stay up but I spend my time replying in good faith just to have my comments removed? And can I also ask why the post was removed? Why give in to bogus reports. Her story was never proven and I provided evidence that pokes holes in the narrative she pushes with that tweet. What gives? 

The comments:

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, the story shows clear bias. 

&gt;You mean like WaPo - who is notably pro-Hillary (all neolibs really) and anti-Bernie and Snopes 'fact check' which is also known for covering for neolib and neocon dems, see their article on Biden's promise of $2k checks. The article from someone who worked at NASA for 22 years holds a little more weight with me than the above two sites, sorry. Either way, she has lied before and used things like her gender for political points and it's disgusting, no matter what party you hail from. You really believe her caring about enpowering women when she endorses someone like Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon??

And:

&gt;&gt;Hey if you want to post a load of shit that’s fine - this article is a load of shit. 

&gt;The evidence points to Hillary being a known bullshitter, probably not as bad as Biden but close.

&gt;&gt;It’s incorrect and written to sensationalise. 

&gt;Disagree.

&gt;&gt;What I will not do is argue whataboutism - If you can’t argue your point on what you posted sit down and shut up

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/GoldandBlack/comments/tk5h94/z/i1pfg15

&gt;"Whataboutism" is a fake fallacy.

&gt;In any honest discussion, it's important to establish "rules." The rules that both sides play by. To demand the other side respect a rule, but not respect it yourself is intellectually dishonest or hypocritical. 

Mods finally replied to me with:  

&gt;This subreddit is precisely the wrong one to post extreme right hatespeech in. 

&gt;This is your only warning. 

I replied back with: 

&gt;WTF? What did I post/say that you consider 'extreme right hatespeech.' I am a leftist btw and as far as I am aware, nothing I have here is hate speech or right wing let along 'extreme right wing hatespeech.' Please would you point out for me what I said here that you consider as such. 

&gt;Argh, I can't type. Nothing I said here* is hatespeech or extreme right wing or even right wing. Please show me where because I do not see it and it was not my intent to say anything to give that impression. I would just like further clarification and to fight this accusation and removals. Please by all means let's get admins involved. 


&gt;Because this is straight up mod abuse, and violation of moddiquette. 

I received no reply back from them yet. I am just completely baffled here as to what I said that they would consider 'extreme right hatespeech.' And from my pov they are making stuff up to justify their arbitrary removals and censorship.

Just received a reply back:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/WhitePeopleTwitter. You can still view and subscribe to r/WhitePeopleTwitter, but you won't be able to post or comment. 

&gt;Note from the moderators: 

&gt;This modmailthread may have fully or partially contributed to your ban: 

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1hcbfpf 

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/WhitePeopleTwitter by replying to this message. 

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole. 

And 

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/WhitePeopleTwitter. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/WhitePeopleTwitter for 28 days. 

What the actual fuck. They never replied and gave me clarification as to what I wrote that was supposedly right wing hatespeech or any hatespeech for that matter, they just permanently banned me for appealing the removals and wanting evidence of their bogus accusation which was used to censor my comments.

Does anyone know how to report this kind of stuff to admins? Or will they even care? I mean look at the censorship and mod abuse I've documented here in just the last year or year in a half. I am sure this is happening to a lot of other folks. Will admins ever address the rampant mod abuse where mods 1) selectively enforce the rules 2) arbitrarily remove posts over political bias/agenda and or 2) giving in to/obliging bogus reports (out perhaps bad faith actors or trolls) to get content and comments removed and users punished/banned. And those same users who do the bogus reporting, gaslight, smear and attack those they report to get censored and they continue posting unabated. 

Again, I am not asking for these folks to be censored, but what does it say about mods who don't apply their own subs rules to these users who blatantly violate their rules and then assist in censoring those targeted by these users, often when they didn't even violate a rule and then perma ban these people when they ask mods to show them where they did what they are accused of doing to warrant the removals.

**Update:**

So I messaged the mods to appeal and try and get the unwarranted ban lifted.

&gt;Messaging you back now after having been muted for 28 days and I would like to appeal this ban and ask where did I ever post right wing hate speech or any hate speech for that matter to warrant this ban. Please provide evidence of this because to my knowledge, I posted no such thing, so perhaps I have been wrongly banned and my appeal deserves to be taken seriously as per moddiquette. Thank you for your time, but I have waited 28+ days (a mute which was uncalled for imo) to appeal this ridiculous ban based on what I believe is a false accusation of spreading right wing hate speech. I am a leftist btw and criticizing Hillary is not sexist or hatespeech.

They replied with:

&gt;Your "Hillary bad" nonsense. This isn't Fox

I replied back with:

&gt;Isn't that a non sequitur? Right wingers aren't the only folks who criticize Hillary. Hillary is not above criticism and I'd argue she is bad for progressives and progressives have called out her nonsense and should do so, is that not allowed here? I stayed on topic. Is healthy debate not allowed here? Please cite where I posted right wing hate speech to support your ban. I don't believe I posted any, but please cite it and take this appeal seriously as is stated under moddiquette.

They responded back with:

&gt;A decades long smear campaign from the extreme right doesn't make someone a bad person. Attack your enemies, not a decent and accomplished politician.

And:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/WhitePeopleTwitter. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/WhitePeopleTwitter for 3 days.</div>
