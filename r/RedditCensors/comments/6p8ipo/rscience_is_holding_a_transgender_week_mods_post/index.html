    <div class="md">I'm so sick of mods deciding what is "offensive" based on what they think will stir up the pot.  People asking legitimate questions without being hurtful is EXACTLY what these types of threads are for.  If asking the hard questions makes you questions your position, then maybe your position should be open to other possibilities.  Silencing others that don't share your same viewpoint is in line with a dictatorship.... But for internet nerds</div>

    <div class="md">First off surgery is not the end all be all of being trans. Plenty of trans people don't get surgery and just take hormones. Some don't even transition, surgery or otherwise, for a variety  reasons.  The defination of being trans is having a gender identity incongruent with your sex assigned at birth.  So all those people are still trans.  Second dysphoria  is the distress one feels from having their gender identity not  match their physical sex and characteristics.  If those feelings disrupt daily functions then it's a mental illness.  However not ever trans person experiences it to  such a magnitude or at all necessarily.  </div>

    <div class="md">that is not how it works though, you can be functional and mentally ill 


"A condition which causes serious disorder in a person's behaviour or thinking."


if a person thinks they are a different gender than they are then technically they are mentally ill, the same way autistic people are still mentally ill even if you cant even tell they are on the spectrum, its nothing to do with ones ability to function, if your brain works vastly differently from the norm then you are mentally ill by definition

people might not like being classified as being mentally ill but im going to assume that is because of the stigma involved, being phobic of the mentally ill is more acceptable than being phobic of trans people so rather than people getting offended maybe work on destigmatizing mental illness

    <div class="md">really, dont a lot of them feel like they where born in to the wrong body, like they where meant to be the other gender?

just because the body is male does not necessarily mean the mind is

but still just wishing or wanting fits the definition?

trans people just dont want to be associated with people that they and the rest of society look down on and think less off, doing the same thing gay people  and  3rd wave feminists did, screw the facts and screw other people as long as i get treated equality you can still mock and mistreat other people

that in itself is hilarious; by that standard if a person thinks they're a horse they don't have a mental illness so long as that person is happy thinking they're a horse lol</div>

From the perspective of society is the correct treatment to chop off their legs, or to give them counselling or medical help to accept their body?</div>

    <div class="md">Definitely counselling to accept their legs are working. The argument gets hairy here though, as there's other outcomes available to gender dysphoria than removing or refusing to use legs. 

There's a considerable difference in the process of transitioning genders than the process of removing a limb. The end result for the individual is still a functioning body with a now accepting mind, where losing a limb would leave you disabled. 

I can't say that helping a transgender person to accept their biologically provided body is a cure in the same way convincing one to recognize their legs work does. </div>

    <div class="md">I feel the need to preface this with "I am not trolling here"

But the procedure in most states, as I understand it is for a person who wants to transition take the following steps:

1. Start living as the opposite sex (typically by using a pseudonym followed by dressing and exhibiting stereotypical gender roles)
2. start taking hormones to alter their biological chemistry to better fit their preferred sex.
3. undergo surgical alteration to become as close as possible to the preferred sex albeit with non-functional organs (that is, they are incapable of being used for procreation)

Likewise, a physical alteration of a person with non-functioning legs could follow this pattern:

1. start living with full time wheel chair use
2. take medication that numbs or otherwise disables the legs
3. surgically remove the legs.

The end result of both is to take something that is perfectly functional and turn it into something that is more appealing to the person, but non-functional.  The difference is one of degrees as far as I see it.

Now, I'm enough of a libertarian, that I say people should have freedom to do what they want but I think it is clear that this is not a problem with the physiology, but rather the psychology, which makes it a de facto mental illness.</div>

    <div class="md">The DSM had homosexuality as a mental illness until the 1970's. As a whole it has it's share of issues. An example is the threshold for binge eating.

&amp;nbsp;

* The binge eating occurs, on average, at least once a week for three months. 

&amp;nbsp;

Someone who may cycle on and off of binging by definition would qualify as having an eating disorder.

Most aren't able to hold their breath for a long time.

Hell, most are not smart. 

Life is full of bell curves, and not being at the median of that bell curve is not inherently bad, much less is it a mental illness.

The lack of of such traits not having a bell curve distribution is abnormal. To expect everyone to fall into such rigid definitions with a biological makeup as complex as ours is absurd. </div>

    <div class="md">Not all abnormalities belong in the DSM. The DSM is for mental disorders, which can be loosely defined as permanent, bad abnormalities of the mind. Gay people may well have served an evolutionary function, such as increasing the number of males able to defend a group without increasing competition for females (obviously applies only to gay men). In modern, developed areas, reproductive rates aren't really a problem because infant mortality is so low.</div>

    <div class="md">what's that basis if you don't mind me asking 

feel free not to answer as it's a loaded topic but from what I've seen the physiological evidence for gender dysphoria are on approximately the same solid scientific ground as phrenology </div>

    <div class="md">It is likely correlated to the level of hormones the fetus was exposed to in the womb. That is not related to whether a person looks feminine or masculine however, the hormones responsible for that develop only during puberty.

 There's lots of information on it if you google for causes for transsexuality (including that r/science thread). Whatever it may be, there is (currently) no working cure, so it's very much like homosexuality. It doesn't really matter what you want to classify it as, the point is that there is no way to change a transsexual person, the most helpful thing is simply transition.

    <div class="md">Are they happier post transition?  Part of the key for happiness, in general, is feeling that you're making progress in life.  What I've seen is people who begin the transition are happier.  I'd suggest 1) because they're making progress and 2) because they're generally younger and easily pass as the other sex.  

...But eventually, maybe when they're ~30+ and start looking more like their birthed gender, they end up very unhappy.  I'd say because they stop making progress and, worse, start losing ground.

I'm fine with gay/trans/whatever.  I just don't see these ineffective surgeries as being that helpful long term.  People over state how effective they are.  Someday if modern medicine can figure out how to actually change someone's biological gender I'm convinced it would help.  I just don't think medicine is there yet. </div>

    <div class="md">I do agree, I'm just saying it's the best we have at the moment. It's fine to be critical of the treatment, but insulting everyone who goes through it doesn't help anyone. Not saying you do it, but lots of people in this thread are very hostile while claiming to care for the well being of those in transition. 

 If they could learn to be happy in their biological gender that'd be great and I'm sure most transgender people would agree. 
Also, there's lots of older trans people that still look great, take a look at r/transtimelines

    <div class="md">So what do you propose? Do you think we haven't tried "curing" them with countless non-invasive methods? Psychotherapy simply doesn't work. It may help reduce an individual's depression, but the gender dysphoria simply doesn't disappear. Lots of transgender people would prefer not to undergo hormone treatment and especially gender reassignment surgery, but it's the only way to make them feel better.</div>

    <div class="md">Science is clearly saying that there is currently no better treatment. It's definitely not ideal, but if you have no alternative, what are you going to do? I've asked you several times for suggestions, but you're just saying "no to sex change". OK, but what do you do with all these suicidal transgender people? 

There is an extremely low percentage of people who regret having done hormone replacement therapy and the majority of those is simply due to general low self esteem (they think they don't look as attractive as they'd like to). And why does it bother you so much anyway? It's their bodies and their decision what to do with them.</div>

    <div class="md">You're so confused.  Just think about what you're saying.  

As you say, those doing peer review often are supposed to "fact check" the claims made.  These reviewers then ARE making claims.  They are claiming the facts claimed by the author are true or false.  And this usually is NOT done by repeating the experiments, just by checking their math, etc.

Just think before typing next time.  And I've been working in the sciences for years now.  So I should know what a load of bull most of science (and especially Reddit) is.</div>

    <div class="md">I love that you think this is about winning and losing ;)  How mature :)

Personally I give zero about down votes.  On Reddit that's practically a badge of honor. I know I'm right, that's enough for me.  When you're older you'll get it.</div>

    <div class="md">Plant science industry.  I've spent a lot of time working around electrochemical cells, spectrometers, etc.  Read scientific papers on the daily.  Most of them are written to look smart and not be helpful, the majority are almost useless.

I contrast the "scientific community" with the engineering/maker community.  It's like night and day.  When an engineering article says X is X, X is always X.  So much more reliable and, almost without exception, their papers are written to be useful not self promoting.  

Basically I think the scientific community is being held back by stupid practices like publishing in journals.  Just look at the dated garbage.  Black and white, no multimedia, no public forum for comments...they're so far behind.  And that's ignoring their stupid politics and over inflated sense of self importance.

I could go on and on.  I have a love hate relationship with the scientific community.</div>

    <div class="md">Thankfully the comments are overwhelmingly in opposition. The mods are only damaging the credibility of their own subreddit. It's the height of irony for a subreddit *devoted to science* to ban people for questioning The Chosen Facts. I'm very pleased to see all the top comments pointing out the problems with this.

Honestly I hope this turns into the shitshow it's shaping up to be. I hope the mods throw out bans Willy-nilly. I'll enjoy watching them needlessly drive intelligent people from their idiotic, ideologically-driven, echo chamber. </div>

    <div class="md">i got my undergrad (hard) science degree around 2012 and back then the field was still mostly all about the science, the facts, the data, but i took an intro psych class and could feel some SJW starting to creep in, even though psych is very much a soft/social 'science.'

so i think it has gotten very much worse over just the past 4 years or so</div>

    <div class="md">I was in an English course with a professor who was *very* liberal (around 2006). We were doing group projects and ours was about anthropogenic climate change. I decided to take the dissenting view that climate change is not man-made. You would have thought I kicked this professor's cat right in the balls. He actually handed out a two page "example" of how he wanted the assignment done.

&amp;nbsp;


 His example paper was all about how he had a neighbor who used a leaf blower instead of a rake. And how a rake is just as effective but didn't pollute the environment. He handed out over 50 copies of his "example", and eventually came around to our group. So I asked him if he had used a typewriter to type out every one of those papers or had he used a computer and printer? His eyes got wider than Sasha Grey's asshole.</div>

See, the entire premise of is it a mental illness or not is if it can harm the individual or the people around it. If not, nobody cares. </div>

    <div class="md">That means you are shadowbanned. A mute occurs when you have already been banned, but are trying to appeal a ban, and the moderators decide to block you for 3 days rather than actually discuss it maturely. A shadowban is not publically told to you, and was done underhandedly. While stated by Reddit admins to be a system to block spambots without notifying the spambot to appeal the ban, shadowbans have been used to silence people.</div>

    <div class="md">Why do they seek therapy? Why therapy is recommended? Why do they experience Gender dysphoria which is an official disorder ICD-10 CM ? Saying transgenderism is not a disorder is like having a broken leg and saying my legs and fine I just cannot walk normally and experience huge pain. And even if I am wrong I'd like to be able to openly discuss it so that people could show me where I'm wrong in a debate or Q&amp;A. That's how science should work.</div>

When I notice a person who does not hold a phd, RN or RNA make a diagnosis, I blatantly ask them how they came to that finding. It usually sounds like "you some kind of doctor, motherfucker"!</div>

    <div class="md">Oh hey, look at this out-dated science. 

Problem is that you folks are holding onto old information. The DSM is notoriously known for taking a while to update their information to reflect new findings. 

Here, read some more up to date information on gender and genetics.

    <div class="md">ya the DSM was updated - not pressured by advocacy groups I'm sure - to state that trans is not a mental disorder if the trans person isnt unhappy

that's very scientific, like saying cancer isnt a disease if you don't know you have it lol</div>
