    <div class="md">Incidents like this only serve to illustrate why ABSOLUTE freedom of speech is necessary, up to and including potentially false or offensive content.  As to offensive content, some people - mainly racists and totalitarians should be offended more.  The more we censor our speech and the more we bow to evil racist totalitarians, the more we weaken ourselves.  We must offend the racists, fascists, communists, and totalitarians.  We must do it frequently, we must do it loudly.  We must do it daily, hourly and even we must learn to think offensive and dangerous thoughts because it is those thoughts which give us freedom and conscience.  If you are not offending the oppressors, then you should be.

As to potentially false statements, there are no absolutes.  Some statements can be false in a context and true in another.  For example the statement "It's dark outside" can depend on the time of day or the weather.  So for any statement which seems absolutely true, there are statements which could potentially be equally true based on the relativity of time and space.  Moreover, no word has an absolute meaning other than what we give to it within the confines of human language.  Such a legalistic way of viewing things in in fact totalitarian and wrong.</div>

To your second: facts are facts. If you let your feelings and emotions drive your every action you are quite literally being a reactionary which leads to you espousing all the principals you pretend to oppose.</div>
