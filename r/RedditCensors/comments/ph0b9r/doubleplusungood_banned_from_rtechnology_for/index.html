    <div class="md">The full offending comment...

&gt;First off, you're assuming that the person you are talking to does not believe Covid exists. Second, you are assuming the person doesn't care about people dying from Covid. Third, whether they do or do not believe in Covid has nothing to do with the debate over abortion.

&gt;In a debate there is what is called a THESIS, or a PROPOSITION, and then an ANTITHESIS, or what is called a COUNTER PROPOSITION, and from the conflict between those two ideas we arrive at a SYNTHESIS, something that is closer to the truth. Your comments were fallacious, you can not arrive at any synthesis because what you said was sophistry and it appealed to emotion. The issue being discussed, for some reason on a technology subreddit, is abortion and whether or not it is morally acceptable to terminate a pregnancy. Notice I say *morally*. We're not discussing religion. We're discussing this from the perspective of morality.

&gt;What is morality? What is right, what is wrong? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells" that would develop into a human? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells" that would develop into a human if there are health complications for the mother? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells" that would develop into a human if the mother was raped? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells"  that would develop into a human if it's just an inconvenience to the prospective mother? Is it *moral* to terminate a "clump of cells"  that would develop into a human if there is a *heart beat*? Does a *heart beat* qualify something as being alive? If so, does a "clump of cells" cease to be a "clump of cells" and does it become alive? If so, is it *moral* to terminate a *life* period?

&gt;The US Constitution prevents the government from violating our right to *Life*, Liberty, and Property. The entire purpose of the US Constitution is to restrain the government from violating what are called *unalienable* rights, rights that we are endowed with by nature and/or our creator. They are *self-evident*. If a woman has within her a living being with a heart beat, is it *moral* to terminate that life under any circumstances at all? These are questions I'm sure we won't solve by engaging in fallacy filled discussions full of sophistry and appeals to emotion.

&gt;*If* a person wants to get vaccinated for Covid and consults with their doctor and the *doctor* tells them to, they definitely should get the vaccine. However, Covid is effectively becoming [endemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/13/dr-scott-gottlieb-expects-coronavirus-to-be-an-endemic-virus-in-us-after-delta-surge.html) to the population and current [studies](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-27/previous-covid-prevents-delta-infection-better-than-pfizer-shot?sref=i4qXzk6d&amp;fbclid=IwAR3oOyXtiEG3pklD6x3OqNr6-VaxMV-Yv8C0Pz5-dTarMBpXQBN4fla2CIs) are suggesting that perhaps getting Covid is more effective than the immunity offered by the vaccines. There is [research](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58270098) that suggests seeking to arrive at 0% Covid is not realistic and is unattainable.

&gt;If a vaccinated person is worried about their health, they are free to wear a mask and take whatever measures they need to to feel safe, but is it right to force someone whose doctor told them they can't get vaccinated, or perhaps doesn't want to get vaccinated because they would rather deal with the virus when they get it and perhaps get better immunity to the virus in the future than a vaccine will offer, to get vaccinated just to make you feel better? Because, again, according to [studies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/08/06/fully-vaccinated-may-transmit-delta-just-as-easily-and-new-variant-shows-signs-of-vaccine-evasion-early-uk-research-suggests/?sh=196668d81ac5) fully vaccinated people are getting and spreading Covid just as easily as an unvaccinated person. So, is it *moral* to force a person to get a medical treatment they may not be able to get, they may not want, and may not even need, just to make *you* feel better?

&gt;I guess downvotes will make the facts go away. Apparently the BBC, Bloomberg, CNBC, Forbes, and the scientists they quote are less informed than the people on /r/technology. "Listen to the experts," except for when they start disagreeing with the experts people have been listening to.

What's funny is they say that saying fully vaccinated people are getting and spreading Covid just as easily as an unvaccinated person "is misinformation, and at best a misinterpretation of the source material." And yet [here](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/evidence-mounts-that-people-with-breakthrough-infections-can-spread-delta-easily) is an article from National Geographic literally titled "Evidence mounts that people with breakthrough infections can spread Delta easily: **A new study finds that this dominant variant can grow in the noses of vaccinated people as strongly as in unvaccinated people**." And [here](https://nationalpost.com/news/world/vaccinated-people-spreading-delta-variant-just-as-quickly-as-the-unvaccinated-leaked-cdc-document/wcm/44cb4c25-91f6-4af1-86a2-533d0ef2d326/amp/?__twitter_impression=true) is an article from the National Post titled "Vaccinated people spreading Delta variant just as quickly as the unvaccinated: Leaked CDC document." And [here](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ultra-vaccinated-israels-debacle-is-a-dire-warning-to-america) is an article from The Daily Beast titled "Ultra-Vaxxed Israel’s Crisis Is a Dire Warning to America" that quotes an Israeli doctor who talks about how Delta spreads just as quickly among the fully vaccinated as it does among the unvaccinated.

As always, people should consult their doctors before taking any medication or receiving any kind of treatment, and they definitely should not take anything formulated for animals or do something just because the TV and the government told them to.</div>

    <div class="md">Man oh man. This massive disinformation, that the "vaccinated" don't catch the virus as much, has been debunked again and again.

These gene therapies do NOTHING to prevent infection. A fully vaxxed person will catch the virus just as easily as anyone else. The drug companies themselves have stated this very clearly. 

All they do is try and keep the symptoms from getting so bad. And it turns out they're not even so great at that. 40% in real life compared to the drug company's original 95% claim.

It is incredibly dangerous to tell people that the vaccines keep them from catching the virus. This turns them into super-spreaders. They will go out sick, thinking it's just a cold, and spread the virus like wildfire.

While those that have not participated in the gene therapy experiments, when sick, will do the right thing and quarantine.</div>
