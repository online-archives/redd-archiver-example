    <div class="md">Antifa is a fascist organization that uses violence to try and push forward their political will against the people. They've co-opted these protests to set up black folks to do violence and destruction on their behalf.  A lot of legitimate protesters are realizing this and starting to rise up against these white kids who took one sociology class in college,  were brainwashed by a commie professor, live in thier mom's basement and don't have jobs.  BTW-this 'set-up' is the ultimate example of 'white privilege.'</div>

    <div class="md">It is beautiful to see these Black Bloc terrorists getting told off by the actual protesters.  

Even turning them into the police, physically. 

Every one of the Antifa goons should be rounded up on sight, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Their terrorist organization has zero integrity or legitimacy.</div>

    <div class="md">Surely ANTIFA is astroturfed? I’m sure there’s a demographic there but their actions don’t align with liberal ideology. Using fear &amp; tyranny to get your way is literally fascism. Surely, if it is even a threat, it only got that way due to grassroots funding. Potentially by the same people funding the right wing astroturfing as well?</div>

    <div class="md">I look at the first two posts and was already under that assumption. I’ll go through and see for myself just to be sure. Hopefully it helps regardless, but idk, people are scared to listen to other realities that don’t match their own. I say other realities because we truly all do have our own individual realities. I know if, let’s say my parents, looked into my brain and read my thoughts they’d probably think I was crazy and vice-versa. We are all (almost) exactly the same biologically apart from pigment, but we survive by creating our own reality and living in it. No one wants to live in a world that they don’t think they understand, even if that means tricking YOURSELF into thinking you do understand it.</div>

    <div class="md">While what you say makes sense in words, when you compare actions, it all falls apart.

How many conservative rallies have turned into riots?

It's not like the Left can't do peaceful protests.  MLK certainly proved it works.

The problem for the Leftists here is that the population base who agrees with their ideals is a tiny minority.  They are forced to embed their activities in the demonstrations of other groups who have more legitimate issues, then corrupt those protests and instigate rioting or other illegal activities.

In essence, the Leftists are parasites of the Liberals.</div>

    <div class="md">For modern values of conservative, sure.  At the time?  No.  Pushing for equal rights was bleeding edge liberal.

Liberal and Conservative labels change over the years.  Conservatives resist change.  Liberals seek change.  That's a overstatement, sure, but it's actually a pretty solid basic definition.

So, after liberals make a change and it sticks for a few decades, and isn't toxic (like abortion), it becomes part of what it means to be conservative.

Free the slaves?  Liberal in the 1860's.  Conservatives accepted it in the 1900's.

Women's Sufferage?  Liberal in the early 1900's.  Conservatives accepted it in the 1950's.

End Jim Crow laws?  Liberal in the 1960's.  Conservatives acepted it in the 1980's.

MLK was a liberal.  He wanted to end Jim Crow and give his people true equality under the law.</div>

    <div class="md">Rabid leftist terrorists brutally attack anything and anyone slightly right of Marx, or even just random people they find outnumbered on the street.

They have no legitimate political ideology, so they resort to physical violence and censorship to force their authoritarian control. They are not interested in discussion. They have proven again and again that they have nothing to say. Just calling normal people "Nazis" to dehumanize and excuse their violence. 

There is no comparison to anything on the right today.</div>

    <div class="md">Any forum that is allowed the freedom of speech you pretend to promote winds up mostly right-leaning.

Why is that?  Because conservatives bring actually logical, reasonable arguments.

And rabid leftists screech "NAZI!!" at anything they disagree with, try to shut it down. When the forum declines their abusive censorship, they either stay, and are swayed by wisdom and reason... 

or go running away screeching, with their hands over their ears.

This is not a theory, it has been seen again and again all over the internet, and IRL.


---

The entire brutal, terrorist riots Antifa &amp; Co are responsible for, have zero political legitimacy.  They have no reasonable ideas or ideals, they are NOT interested in talking...  only control and shit slinging. With lots of attempted murder thrown in.  This is obvious to anyone that is paying the least attention to their methods.

Look at the cesspool of rabid leftist / Shareblue propaganda that /politics has become here.  All major "politics" and "news" subs are full of such cancer. They allow no dissenting voices. 

There is hardly a place on reddit, facebook, google (Ytube), twitter, etc that allows conservative views.  Rabid leftist cencorshit abounds.  And all the while, they let their darling, rabid leftist subs get away with calls to violence, doxxing, swatting, brigading, on the daily.  Promoting arson, robbing, rape, death and destruction on the ones they disagree with politically. 

You say that both sides are equal.  Sorry, you don't even have a legitimate "side" to the argument. Just blatant propaganda, violence and censorship.  

Show me any forum, on the web or tv / radio, that really allows free speech, that is run by leftists such as Antifa, rad-fem, BLM, etc... There are none. At all.

Such rabid leftist, terrorist authoritarians are directly *opposed* to free speech. For exactly the reasons I've given.</div>

    <div class="md">There is zero need for anything like that.  Antifa makes themselves look bad enough all on their own. 

The left is fond of such false flag operations, for the opposite reason. Their demand for "right wing violence" so far outstrips the actual supply, they constantly and consistently try to manufacture their own.</div>

    <div class="md">And people wonder why I call Republicans projectionist.  Or have events of the past few years (basically since Trump entered the race) just been leftist propaganda as well? It's no wonder what's been happening the past several days has transpired with all that preceded it. But you ignore all that so it fits your preferred world view and can blame the other guy.</div>

    <div class="md">Antifa has investigated Antifa and found no wrongdoing.

IF it was fake, there would be actual word from Twitter, or some legitimate reporting.  

Of course their terrorist subreddit is going to deny it (while they organize more terrorist riots off-site).

This ONE could be fake, but they're well known for exactly this kind of crap. 

Also tons of ads in the papers before these latest terrorist riots started, offering cash for such terrorist cells. Most of the instigators of the violence and destruction were from out of state too, which is their typical M.O.</div>
