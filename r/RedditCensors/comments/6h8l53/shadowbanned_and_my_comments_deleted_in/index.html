    <div class="md">This actually isn't true, my mother is a marriage commissioner in our church and she can deny a straight couple for any reason but not a gay couple.  For example a 65 year old man marrying an 18 year old. If she said no her license would be stripped. 

Edit: apparently it's not illegal. Though I would say government bodies pretending it is can still be called "forced"</div>

    <div class="md">You're mixing things up.

A deputy marriage commissioner is a government agent and not related to a church in any way shape or form (other than personal, ofc). You're mother is given this authority by the government, not the church. And yes, they can't deny same sex couples because a) it's against federal law and b) a deputy marriage commissioner is required to obtain a legally binding marriage *license*. A church, however, can deny a marriage *ceremony* (which isn't legally binding) to whomever they want. No one forces churches to do anything they don't want. 

**Tl;Dr**: Your mother isn't forced to walk them down the isle, she's required to fulfill her government duties. 

Stop spreading bullshit already.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok then I guess that's whats happening.  Sorry for sharing my experience. 

Edit:     Where i'm from.  What was happening.  Basically they were sent letters to return their marriage licenses which was against law. That wasn't common knowledge.  
http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/commissioners-have-right-to-refuse-to-wed-gay-couples-toews-1.495614

Edit 2:  please mark as edited when completely rewriting your post thanks.
I have no idea if a marriage commissioner is even what she is tbh I just know shes basically a priest and marries people so I used a word to describe it.   I never cared about her technical status myself and never thought it would be relevant to reddit.

Edit 3: my mom and now another source had no idea they wouldn't get there licenses removed.   That isn't knowledge you're updated with if you don't care it seems

    <div class="md">Well fuck i was a teen then and thats just what she told me.   I don't live with my mom at 27 and ask her for updates on gay marriage laws.  I was just sharing my experience. Got told I was wrong. Then said. Oh yeah this is why I felt this way


Edit: got an update.  She had no idea it's illegal for them to pull her license.  It was implied it would be through her teachings.

    <div class="md">I didn't completely rewrite it. You didn't comprehend "then your curch counsil decided that way, because a curch can deny a marriage to whomever they want, the courthouse and vital records office can't" so I clarified it for you. 

Also: you can be a priest and a marriage commissioner at the same time. However: Isn't it kind of ironic to have a church that won't allow gay marriages by any means but has a female priest..? </div>

    <div class="md">Anand you're still wrong:

Marriage is officiated in other ways that *aren't* religious. Government officials oversee marriages all the time, Justice of the Peace, Judges, notary public can also officiated weddings as part of their job responsibilities. 

And states that require a religious official to be married must abide the law.

Also, the state must issue a license to get married. Obama didn't *force* anyone to marry anyone. The Supreme Court stated that a marriage between two consenting adults legal. No one person holds the power that you're stating. </div>
