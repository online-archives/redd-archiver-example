    <div class="md">While I certainly don’t agree with the ban for OP expressing his opinion, this opinion is an incredibly ignorant one.  Especially calling it an “anti-war” opinion.  Ukraine did not start this war.  Russia is the one waging an aggressive and unprovoked war in an attempt to annex parts of Ukrainian land and destroy its sovereignty by installing a puppet regime.  Being “anti-war” in this situation is just advocating for giving up in the face of aggression.  This is not just some random spat that we are funding.  Furthermore, if Russia wins in Ukraine than a much larger and destructive war is likely to follow.  Ensuring Russia is defeated is preventing that.</div>

I don’t agree with Russia starting the war, but let’s not pretend this war just started in a vacuum. There’s a broader geopolitical context and Ukraine has never been in the western sphere of influence historically speaking. 

We’re sending billions of dollars to a corrupt shit hole in Eastern Europe while our own country is falling apart at home. Pardon me for valuing what happens in my own country over a country on the other side of the globe that contributes nothing to the west.</div>

The US is not falling apart as you claim. I mean there's a lot to fix in our current system. But it has nothing to do with as you claim "sending billions of dollars to a corrupt shit hole in Eastern Europe". 

It's like the OP in the health care crisis. Did he vote for a party that refuses to even entertain a better system. Did he vote for a party that voted against any sort of single payer system. 

Also even, EVEN if this Ukraine war wasn't going on. You really think congress as it stands would have a chance of improving Healthcare, addiction, economic inequality. Hell we have a insane house speaker atm who won't even vote on the border bill. Because it MIGHT benefit Biden in the elections.

    <div class="md">> We did the exact same thing that you accuse the Russians if wanting to do

This is utterly ludicrous.  The euro maidan was a popular protest movement by regular Ukrainians who were tired of their Russian puppet government and who wanted to be part of Europe and not the Soviet bloc.  The US did not fund jack shit.  But again, the notion that supporting a popular uprising against a corrupt and autocratic regime is the same thing as invading a sovereign nation to install a puppet government and destroy its national identity is ridiculous.  The notion that Euro maidan was a Western plot and not a popular uprising is straight Russian propaganda.  It is incredibly disrespectful to the Ukrainians who took part in that, and to the god knows how many Ukrainians who have died defending their nation from Russia *because they don’t want to be controlled by Russia*.  I strongly suggest you watch the documentary titled “Winter on Fire” on netflix.  It is about Euromaidan and is told from the perspective of people who were there and is mostly actual footage of the uprising.  

> There’s a broader geopolitical context

Yea and that broader geopolitical context is that Russia wants to control Ukraine for its own benefit because it wants to re-establish the Russian empire.  The broader geopolitical context is this is the start of an attack on the liberal world order that the US established after world war 2 and that has underpinned our economic success and prosperity since then.  

> to a corrupt shithole in Eastern Europe

Ukraine has made great strides in corruption.  But it was so corrupt to begin with because of Russia.  This is how Russia operates and undermines its neighbors.  

> has never been in the Western sphere of influence historically speaking

Plenty of countries weren’t before but now are.  It is squarely within our national interest to bring more countries into the West.

> while our own country is falling apart at home

Withdrawing from the world is not going to fix our issues, it will only make them 10x worse.

> Pardon me for valuing what happens in my own country over a country on the other side of the globe that contributes nothing to the west.

The point is that what happens in Ukraine affects what happens in our own country.  Ukraine is absolutely contributing to the West right now.  Russia is the one of the largest threats to the Western world order, and Ukraine is decimating their military capabilities which would take years to rebuild if the war ended right now.  Ukraine is a nation that *wants* to be a democracy and part of the West.  They had a literal revolution over it in 2014 and are now valiantly fighting a war against Russia over it.  Ukraine has the potential to be a strong ally in Europe, it is in our national security and economic interest that as many nations in the world as possible are free and prosperous nations that we are allied with.  It is harmful to our long term national security interests to let Russia grow in power by invading and annexing its neighbors.  Which by the way, will not stop in Ukraine.  The Baltics are next.  And then the US will be faced with going to war with Russia or abandoning the world order our success over the past 80 years has been built on.  I strongly suggest you watch [this](https://youtu.be/eUL8EvZkfEY?si=rFTF1CluVBclemqg) youtube video by Perun on how military alliances fit into US long term strategy.  

Ensuring Ukraine retains its sovereignty and that Russia is defeated is in our national security and economic interest because maintaining and expanding the free world order is in our national security and economic interest.  This is an attack on that order which will not stop at Ukraine.  Besides all that, we also have a strong moral obligation to help Ukraine.  Ukraine is not Afghanistan.  Ukraine wants to be part of the free world.  Its people fought a revolution in 2014 to move away from Russia and to the free world.  And now Ukrainians are dying by the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands to not come under Russia’s boot.  When we fought our own revolution we got a lot of help from other nations, it would be morally derelict to now turn our backs on a people in a similar situation.  Not to mention the fact that Ukraine gave up its nukes for US security assurances.  If we turn our backs in Ukraine then that will hurt our credibility.</div>

I’ve watched that “documentary” and it was fairly obvious it was propaganda. Just because you call something a “documentary” doesn’t mean it’s not tainted by bias or has certain info edited out. They completely ignored the role that neo Nazi groups played in the movement. The documentary also failed to include conversations between Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt (US state actors). 

The director of Winter On Fire even admitted to glossing over the involvement of actual far right neo Nazi groups. That documentary presents an entirely one sided view of Maidan and excludes certain key facts that are politically inconvenient.

Financed and helped how exactly?  With political support?  That doesn’t change anything.  

The fact that there are neo-Nazis in Ukraine and those neo-nazis participated in euro maidan does not mean it was not a popular uprising in pursuit of a free country that is part of the West.  Calling the documentary propaganda is just utterly ridiculous.  I fail to see how conversations between to us state actors prove much of anything.

What is the other side?  The side of the Berkut who beat student protestors?  The side of the corrupt Russian puppet government?  The side of Russia, who is responsible for the corruption in the first place?  What other side is there?  

You also conveniently ignored all my other points.  You want to call documentaries propaganda yet are repeating actual Russian propaganda.  I thought perhaps you might be a reasonable person that has legitimate concerns and can be reasoned with.  I was wrong.</div>

    <div class="md">>The fact that there are neo-Nazis in Ukraine and those neo-nazis participated in euro maidan does not mean it was not a popular uprising…

So why did the director of Winter On Fire omit their involvement? You can’t call the documentary objective if it omits key facts that contributed to maidan itself. It’s incredibly deceptive to international audiences by excluding any information regarding their involvement in what happened with Maidan. The only reason to exclude key points of information like that is if you think the info is damaging to the central theme and message of the documentary itself. People should have that information because it gives a more complete and honest picture of what was going on and who the important groups/actors were. 

What exactly would you call a film that deliberately leaves out key facts about unrest and armed resistance in a country? If you’re honest, you’d call it propaganda because in any other context that’s what it would be. 

>What is the other side?

Half the country was split on maidan. Not every Ukrainian agreed with their goals or what they wanted. 

I’m not reciting Russian propaganda; these are facts that you’re attempting to hand wave away because they’re politically inconvenient to the lore behind Ukraine over the last 10 years.</div>

    <div class="md">> So why did the director of Winter On Fire omit their involvement

Because it was not a neo-nazi uprising.  Their involvement is not a “key fact” because Euromaidan was not in pursuit of neo-nazi goals, nor did it result in a neo-nazi or fascist government.  It resulted in a more free and democratic country, and that’s what the vast majority of the people who were at Euromaidan were fighting for.  The fact that neo-nazis participated in it and supported it for their own reasons doesn’t change that.  

> Half the country was split on Maidan

The majority of Ukrainians supported it and want to be part of the West.  Even more so now than before.  They are literally fighting an all-out war in pursuit of that.  

> these are facts you’re attempting to hand-wave away

The only one attempting to hand-wave away anything here is you.  You haven’t even responded to most of my original reply, you know about how this is important to our national security and economic interest.  You’ve latched onto the fact that neo-nazis participated in Euromaidan to somehow argue that it was not about joining the West or about freedom, even though that’s what it resulted in.  You’re attempting to grossly inflate the importance of that fact, which is the Russian propaganda part.  Oh, and the implication that the West somehow controlled Euromaidan is also the Russian propaganda part.  It is truly jarring how many people in the US believe in Russian propaganda.</div>

    <div class="md">>Because it was not a neo-nazi uprising.

Nobody claimed that. My question was why did they omit that info from the documentary? It is a fact that they were participants in Maidan, and excluding that information is dishonest for the sake of transparency and the historical record. The reason that information is important is because it shows that things weren’t nearly as black and white as the director of Winter On Fire tried to portray it as. You’re being intellectually dishonest by defending that omission. 

>You haven’t even responded to most of my original reply

I did. I think all you’re doing is regurgitating state department propaganda. You don’t like it, but I did respond to your reply about “security” and “economic interests.” I think it’s a load of neocon/neolib bullshit that DC insiders/hacks tell themselves so they can ignore the economic and social decay inside our own country. I as an American don’t stand to gain anything from this conflict, but defense contractors do. This is just a perpetuation of the military industrial complex and it having to make justifications for its continued existence. We can fund billions for a conflict that most Americans aren’t impacted by in anyway, but somehow we can’t invest the same amount of money on our overburdened southern border. 

Ukraine isn’t a NATO member. Ukraine is an insanely corrupt country where human trafficking has been rampant for years and currently is an area of the world where a lot of international arms dealing is going on. 

Fuck off with your “security” and “economic interests” arguments because I’m not buying it. I think that’s a cop out for continuing hawkish foreign policy goals. It damn sure isn’t doing anything for me.</div>

    <div class="md">> My question was why did they omit that info from the documentary?

I told you why.  Because it’s not what the uprising was about.  

> I did. 

You didn’t.

> I think it’s a load of neocon/neolib bullshit

This is just wildly ignorant of the conditions that make your quality of life possible.  You can call it bullshit all you want, but America’s economic success is underpinned by a free world order (relative stability, free trade, a prosperous world).  That free world order was made possible by the US’s military might.  

> “security” and “economic interests”

Putting those things in quotes doesn’t diminish their importance.  And it doesn’t refute anything I said.  

> economic and social decay

This is hilarious.  Our economy is the strongest it had ever been.  I think you’ve just watched too much Fox news.  

> We can fund billions for a conflict that most Americans aren’t impacted by in anyway

But they are.  And I explained how.  Which you just said “nuh-uh” to. You just lives in ignorance of how the world around you works and what makes it tun.  We live in a globally connected economy and world, what happens outside out borders has a strong impact on what happens inside our borders.  You haven’t logically explained how that isn’t the case, you just called it bullshit.  You seem to be happy living in ignorance, but I’m still going to suggest you watch [this](https://youtu.be/eUL8EvZkfEY?si=rvDKpWpIBmaUQ__Z) video on youtube by Perun.  It explains how military alliances fit into long-term US strategy and how the Ukraine war affects that.

> souther border

There was a bill that address the southern border that was bipartisan and that was endorsed by border agencies.  Republicans killed it because Trump wanted the border to remain an issue for the election and they went along with it.  

 > Ukraine isn’t a NATO member

NATO members are next.  It is blatantly obvious by Russia’s actions and demands.  So if you care about NATO, isn’t better to spend money to defeat Russia now instead of having to send our troops to die in a war against Russia later?  This is a direct threat and challenge to NATO.  Furthermore *we do* have an obligation to help Ukraine.  We gave security assurances to Ukraine in the Budapest memorandum in return for  it giving up its nukes.  Turning away from that only weakens our credibility and encourages other countries to develop their own nukes, unless you want to tell me lowering the risk of a global nuclear war isn’t in our interest either?  

> Ukraine is an insanely corrupt country

Ukraine is much less corrupt than it used to be.  [Read this](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/wartime-ukraine-ranks-among-worlds-top-performers-in-anti-corruption-index/).  Ukraine continues to improve in anti-corruption and is now ahead of Turkey, a NATO member, in corruption.  Again, this is Russian propaganda you are pushing.  Ukraine still has an issue with corruption that it absolutely needs to continue addressing, but the over-stated severity of it is Russian propaganda.  

> Fuck off with your “security” and “economic interests”

Yea this isn’t much of a response to anything.  It just reeks of ignorance of what makes your quality of life possible.  Having strong allies is in our interest.  Growing our alliances, both military and economic, is in our interest.  Is it not in our long term interest to have as many free and stable democracies in the world as possible?  Is it not in our interest to weaken countries who actively undermine us and those around them like Russia?  Is it not in our interest to have as much access to global trade and markets that is unimpeded by countries like Russia?  Is it not in our interest for those markets to be prosperous?  Do you really think a free and stable world is not in our interest?  You really need to educate yourself.</div>

The same russia that has lied about everything lol. So you deflected and brought up the fact that some neonazis were part of the protests in order to change the subject and cast a documentary as propaganda for not including it in said documentary when the protest were about a corrupt president not nazi ideology. And even if you say you are not Republican your political ideology is on the right.

I read that link. And there's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the US financed. And do you know why the US helps democracies? Because it benefits the US goal of world peace. Because democracies as a whole are very unlikely to choose war willingly. 

I'm sure that statement is funny. Because you'll bring up Iraq and Afghanistan. But Afghanistan was in response to a terrorist attack. And then Iraq was a response to that same terrorist attack, who supposedly had WMD. Know we all know why that the Iraq reason was false. But I'm just explaining why Iraq was supported by the US people at the time. Afghanistan was a response to 9/11

>I’ve watched that “documentary” and it was fairly obvious it was propaganda. Just because you call something a “documentary” doesn’t mean it’s not tainted by bias or has certain info edited out. They completely ignored the role that neo Nazi groups played in the movement. 

This is so odd. I mean we have neo-nazis in our(I dont believe you are an American citizen but whatever) armed forces. I mean so what? It's also odd that Zelensky was voted in, by Eastern Ukraine. Which supposedly had the majority of neo-nazis. I mean kinda odd that your pushing that neo-nazi's where in Ukraine(they are also in the US). Controlling the maiden, and controlling the orange protests. And yet your whole point is neo-nazis are controlling Ukraine. What a weak argument. 

>The documentary also failed to include conversations between Victoria Nuland and Geoffrey Pyatt (US state actors).

Which isn't as big of a deal as you think it is. I mean every nation tries to get people in charge who would be beneficial to their interests. That's EXACTLY what russia was doing to Ukraine prior to any color revolution. So what is your point? Seriously WHAT IS YOUR POINT?

Have you read this paper? I have. It's hugely speculative. And they even point it out that in the "Evidence and Research Methods". But it's hardly the slam dunk you think it is. And if you read the paper. It's pointing you in the direction of the conspiracy. By leading you to make these forced jumps. It's not the slam dunk you think it is. 

It's hilarious though. Because in that very paper, the US is all but staying out of an international investigation. And leaving it to the Ukrainian authorities. But russia is not. Why is russia allowed to interfere in a Ukrainian revolution, but the US and NATO isn't? 

Either way if you are an American citizen (you aren't) you have fallen to the propaganda of the enemy. And as you aren't, it's obvious that you're a ruski.</div>

    <div class="md">>Who gives a shit about spheres of influence

The West and Russia do. That’s all this conflict is about. The US has for decades maintained a policy of having strong influence over Latin and South America, you’re insanely naive if you think the US would allow foreign adversaries like China or Russia to hold influence over those regions given that they’re in our own backyard.</div>

    <div class="md">The irony here is that same people who condemn Vietnam and condemned the US being stationed (at their request) across the Middle East, are not incessantly telling us how badly Ukraine needs out help, that the US must act.

The same people who argued that the US do nothing in 2012 when Russia first invaded Ukraine let Putin know that he could act with impunity. And these same goblins are standing up tall insisting that while the deficit spend, er, squander hundreds of nillions on nonsensical domestic spending, we can also send surplus equipment that has to be replaced by more expensive material purchased with, again, deficit dollars to be produced by an industry that the Democrats have gutted for 3 decades.</div>

    <div class="md">First off the usa invaded Vietnam. As far as the middle east is concerned what's the end point of us being their? Second the stuff we gave Ukraine is old and would have sat in storage for years until we gave it away or decommissioned it. We haven't used the ods variant of bradlies for a few decades. Third we would have bought  new shit regardless the usa spends over 700 billion on the military annually. Fourth its given the usa an opportunity to get rid of the crap we bought in the 80s like Humvees and m113. Fifth Ukraine will have to pay the usa back for a majority of the stuff. Seventh how have the Democrats gutted rathion and other defense contractors? And lastly do you know how expensive it is to rotate bragadies to Europe something we do because of russia? Do you not understand the amount of logistical support rotating thousands of troops it takes. Do you realize how much money it takes to ship one 70 ton abrams? Ukraine is saving us a ton of money in the long run by destroying so much of Russian military that we the usa can allocate more resources to focus on china.</div>

    <div class="md">If you don’t see the Vietnam parallel i don’t know what to tell you. North Vietnam and South existed before we started sending thousands of troops. First we sent war materiel, then we sent advisors, then we found an excuse to get involved. That’s what people are seeing and worried of in this Ukraine situation. 

The “we’d spend it regardless” is the exact argument keeping this whole damn system propped up. How about we start demanding we you know… don’t do that. Maybe we can start by not being so damn hawkish every time someone does something we don’t like 

Ukraine is gunna pay it back?! With what? The country even if it remains is gunna be wallowing in so much debt that the US won’t see a penny till the 3000’s.

I get that Ukraine isn’t so simple.. and everyone is gunna make parallels to appeasement with Hitler, but the situation isn’t the same. Telling people that they’re basically supporting Russia by cautioning against getting too entangled in a war that doesn’t have an end in sight and frankly doesn’t affect us all that much is fucking stupid. 

I swear 10 years ago all I heard was we shouldn’t be the world’s police and rightfully so. We’ve been out of Afgan and Iraq (mostly) for 3 years and it seems a lot of people have forgotten that.</div>

    <div class="md">That's a dumb take. European nato countries spent over 347 billion dollars on defense last year. Russia only spent 84 billion and they are in a war. China spent 290 billion in 2022. That's not even factoring in the strategic importance of having access to military bases that allow out navy to operate anywhere in the world. And having nato navies help keep the shipping lanes free so that our economy doesn't tank overnight.</div>

    <div class="md">Europe is a continent. Europe is a geographical location. It isn’t a place that helps anyone do anything. A large piece of Europe have countries that have aided the US, but your comment is nonsensical to justify being involved in the conflict just because it’s “in Europe”. 

Ukraine… as much as it sucks they’re getting attacked was not in an alliance with the US.  It’s also a massively corrupt state historically which plays into the whole NATO membership thing. 

If Russia attacked a NATO ally (such as Poland, as you pointed out) all of the map here would go to war. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO

The same people that were wondering why we were at war in the Middle East are the same ones supporting Ukraine. We have no business being there and supporting the conflict, in my opinion. 

Israel is *completely* different because we’re literally allies with them (unlike Ukraine). If we were allied with Ukraine, I’d support the conflict in a similar way. But we aren’t. 

Hell we have/had *much* stronger ties with the Kurds, which we so gracefully fucked over in the Middle East. So if we’re pulling away from them, why support Ukraine?</div>

    <div class="md">We are allied with Ukraine we are one of the signatories that promised we would come to their aid if they were attacked because we wanted them to give up their nukes. As far as Israel is concerned they are such great allies that helped china build it's new fighter jet. Lol. Actually NATO doesn't specify that all countries have to go to war so no maby people like you start saying why do we need poland? Oh and no offense to the Kurds but they are the minority in the middle east unless you made them the majority they will always get f****</div>

    <div class="md">Oh dear. Let me clarify some things for you. 

The Trilateral statement in 94 isn’t a treaty. Guess who else was a co-signer? Russia... Referencing a non-treaty agreement from 30 years ago is kind of a moot point. 

There’s no question that Israel does some questionable things… but they’re still allies. And for clarification - they are allies, and Ukraine are *not*.

And you stating the minority statement about the Kurds is just… holy shit how ignorant. Kurds are certainly not a minority in Kurdistan (which should be its own country, but that’s a different topic). It’s clear to me based on that fucked up statement that you’re saying if Ukraine was a minority group, they should get fucked? Wow…</div>

    <div class="md">Lol first off economics and geography wont allow Kurdistan to be it's own country lol you do realize that that country cant exists surrounded by countries that hate Kurds with no access to the sea? Not to mention the fact that the usa would have to invade iran, iraq, Syria, Turkey and Armenia. Well you just described a false ally if Israel is aligning with our biggest rival in china and giving them technology. The Budapest memorandum wasn't a trilateral statement lol it was a agreement on security guarantees. So your views on American geopolitics are to support a country who helps our rivals. To help a minority group who is a ally of convenience with a perceived territory that is in 5 separate countries and one of those countries is an ally. All the while ignore  a country that is actually helping us by destroying the military capability of our second biggest rival so in the future we can focus on one. We get absolutely nothing for giving Israel weapons it doesn't make America safe it's the opposite we now have to bomb Yemen and iraq. While in Ukraine they have destroyed something like half of Russian active tanks prewar.</div>

    <div class="md">\>Lol first off economics and geography wont allow Kurdistan to be it's own country lol you do realize that that country cant exists surrounded by countries that hate Kurds with no access to the sea? Not to mention the fact that the usa would have to invade iran, iraq, Syria, Turkey and Armenia.

The Kurds were allies for a very long time with the US.  And we pulled out, fucking them over - this was my biggest issue with Trump's foreign policy, and was a travesty.  But my point stands that your view on them is quite racist "minority group shouldn't have their own country".

\>Well you just described a false ally if Israel is aligning with our biggest rival in china and giving them technology.

I don't think there's any evidence that Israel is "aligned with China".  A single instance of a collaboration is hardly a betrayal, even though I strongly am against the idea.

\>The Budapest memorandum wasn't a trilateral statement lol it was a agreement on security guarantees.

The Budapest memorandum is literally called "Trilateral Statement", nor was it a security agreement assuring their defense as a nation.  There is \*nothing\* in it that entitles Ukraine to a specific response from the United States (or others).  It's not an official treaty.  Read about it and stop preaching as if it was. 

\>So your views on American geopolitics are to support a country who helps our rivals.

Of course not, but your immediate generalization of a specific instance is certainly a \*little\* obtuse.  

\>To help a minority group who is a ally of convenience with a perceived territory that is in 5 separate countries and one of those countries is an ally. All the while ignore a country that is actually helping us by destroying the military capability of our second biggest rival so in the future we can focus on one.

I am 100% disinterested in supporting Ukraine, correct.  If anything, it is proving the military technology of the US works well (specifically Javelins), I guess that's a silver lining.

\>We get absolutely nothing for giving Israel weapons it doesn't make America safe it's the opposite we now have to bomb Yemen and iraq. While in Ukraine they have destroyed something like half of Russian active tanks prewar.

There are obvious benefits to being allied with Israel...?

Also please use some basic grammar and formatting, your responses are giving me a headache.</div>

    <div class="md">First off I have nothing against the Kurds. I'm just stating the obvious that what you consider Kurdistan is land that is in five different countries, and that it would be impossible for the Kurds to have their own country. Second it would be a land locked country with all of its neighbors hating them with no access to trade and having to guard against every square inch of boarder. Third kurds were a ally of convenience as a minority group they were subjugated for years and second class citizens. But they are a very weak without a centralized government with lots of factions. Also Turkey a more important geopolitical ally wouldn't stand for support of a usa backed Kurdish state. ( especially because it would take Turkish land)                                                 Israel has done more then just a one off collaboration. They have stood against USA's interests on more then one occasion. What have we got back from backing Israel? Our support has actually made it more difficult to work in the middle east. It has took years of work to gain the few allies we have in the middle east and had opened the door for china and Russia. You say their are obvious benefits that we have from backing isreal. What are they?                                                                                 No while the budapest memorandum didn't specify how the usa would respond, it did promise to come to Ukraine's aid should they get attacked. You are literally spitting hairs. You can call it whatever you want but the official UN title is (Memorandum on security assurances in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons) and it was a treaty that is registered with the UN lol.                                                                                          The fact that your are disinterested in supporting Ukraine, But are intrested in supporting isreal and the kurds show how inept your views are. Tell me what would be the end result for supporting the kurds be?  Is it going to be like with isreal where we have to alienate the region and basically pay them billions of dollars every year in assistance with no end insight with zero return on investment? Outside of oil something isreal doesn't have, and something Kurdistan wouldn't be able to export, because they wouldn't have access to the sea and all their neighbors would hate them so good luck with a pipeline. Not to mention most oil fields are in saudia Arabia. An ally that is shaky at best and would definitely be opposed to a Kurdish state.</div>

    <div class="md">We literally supported the Kurds for YEARS. But like I said that’s a bit off topic, but yes - it’s a travesty that the Kurds don’t have their own country. You’re using an off topic side comment I said in parenthesis because you have no force behind your argument.

I’m not fucking splitting hairs *at all*. Please read NATO Article 5. That’s the level of requirement and detail needed. A 30 year old (and vague) memorandum is 100% not what’s required to solidify an alliance. 

You think my views are inept because I want to support allies and people that worked with us for many years during the middle eastern conflict (which we also shouldn’t have been involved in the first place, but pulling the rug out from under the Kurds is kind of my entire point above). Like you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about.</div>

    <div class="md">Lol we never had a treaty with the kurds. And by your argument if we support a group for years we are obligated to them? If that's your argument then we have supported Ukraine with training since the 1990s and have supported them with aid since 2014. Second the usa has all sorts of treaties outside of nato. For example Japan, South Korea, and Israel are all NOT PART OF NATO. Yet we have treaties with all of them SEPREATE from nato. By your definition United states of America doesn't have a treaty with isreal it is a memorandum (also known as a agreement) lol dude you clearly have no clue what you are talking about. The isreal treaty is literally called ( the memorandum of understanding) so we should stop aid for isreal right now and never help them in the future as it's just a 25 year old ( and vague ) memorandum.

    <div class="md">The ( status of forces agreement ) is for any country that hosts us troops it dictates how us troops operate in a foriegn country. Not a defense treaty. ( Mutual logistics and support agreement) that's a trade treaty not a defense treaty. ( General security of information agreement) classified information agreement not a defense treaty. (Mutual defense assistance agreement) is a mutual logistic logistics support agreement. Lol read what those things mean it would be like me pulling out ( assistance of criminal matters agreement) 1999 yes it's a treaty with Ukraine but is not a defense treaty.

The money sent to Ukraine since the 1990s (and might I add, countless “regional partners”) is funny to bring up, because the US is by far funding the military effort in Ukraine. And I mean PUMPING cash into that war. This is separate from sending money to regional partners which we do globally on an annual basis. 

You say I’m wrong but you’ve not come up with one argument that refutes anything I’m saying.</div>

    <div class="md">Bro you literally can only say things that are wrong again per capita the usa isn't even close and if you combine Europe as a whole. Something you should do as thier combined gdp is only 15 trillion and usa alone is 23 trillion and the fact that they are basically one country if you factor in the European union. Europe has already outpaced United states. Second our defense budget is over 700 billion annually and we are saving cash by not only giving the equipment we are replacing anyways. But we if Ukraine wins we wont have to constantly send our equipment to europe or have as big of a presence and can focus on china. Look up how much it costs the usa to send a brigade to Europe. 1.19 billion dollars that's only about 4k troops. Imagine having to send 100k troops something we have done in the past to counter Russia.</div>

    <div class="md">Hmm you keep saying I’m “wrong” but fail to once provide a [source](https://www.ifw-kiel.de/topics/war-against-ukraine/ukraine-support-tracker/). 

Do you know what per capita means??

US contributions: 67.7 billion

US population: ~342 million

US contribution per capita: €198/person

EU contributions+countries: 144.1 billion

EU population: ~742 million

EU contribution per capita: €194/person

So no, the US 100% gives more per capita. 

Now you confused “per capita” with “as a percentage of GDP”, which you’re correct, the US economy is stronger than the sum of all the countries in the EU. But we’re also, you know, NOT IN EUROPE.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah they weren’t going to give up the nuclear weapons they had physically but no control over.  But that memorandum holds very little weight... It’s riddled with “shoulds” and no “shalls” or “wills”. Important distinction that you don’t care about for some reason.  There’s no obligation here, it’s not a strong security pact. 

Again… Russia is in violation but the US has no obligations here. Why do you think Ukraine is so desperate to join NATO?  It’s because article 5 *would* pull other countries into direct conflict.  

If you were right, wouldn’t we have declared war once Russia annexed Crimeria in 2014? Why not now?  It’s exhausting trying to explain all of this to you. My brain isn’t weird, you have no understanding in which you spew nonsense.</div>

    <div class="md">Why are you making the assumption that a NPT has anything to do with a security/alliance with Ukraine?????

Let’s make the assumption that your interpretation is correct - it says “should”. Very important word here. By every interpretation of this article the US has no obligation to support Ukraine.</div>

    <div class="md">If you want things to get better in the long term, if you don't want to fight a land war in Europe in the next decade or two, or have to fight China in the Pacific, both because of mutual defense treaties, then you ought to support Ukraine. If we don't, and Ukraine falls, then the world order shifts. Regional powers can, once again, annex their neighbors. China will be emboldened to invade Taiwan and perhaps other regions after. Plus other nations may take advantage of such circumstances to start their own smaller wars.

All of this is bad for us. International trade is how we enjoy the lives we lead. COVID should be proof enough that disrupting the economy, whether it be disease, famine, or war, is awful for everyone. We can't just close our doors and say it's not our business. It doesn't work that way anymore.

Therefore, it is in our best interest, perhaps one of our greatest interests, to support Ukraine and Taiwan. If we can prevent China from ever invading Taiwan, if Ukraine can win or make Russia hurt so bad it's not worth it, then we get to continue enjoying our cushy lives for further generations. If we fail in this, future generations will likely need to go to war in much larger and far more expensive conflicts. This is a potentially pivotal moment in history, we need to think about the future.

It is in our best interest to do this. Congress' failure to pass other kinds of laws and changes has fuck all to do with it. They can do both. We have totally unnecessary budget items we can remove if needed. We can afford just about any change you might want. The question is whether Congress wants to pass it. But if they tell you they can't because of funding Ukraine, of which a fraction is actual money, then they're lying to your face.</div>

    <div class="md">Taiwan I can see as a strategic partner due to their chip production but it's well documented that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe and there are tons of reports of misallocated funds and missing money. The US is footing the bill for the vast majority of aid to Ukraine while Europe has done very little even though they are neighbors. Most of NATO don't even hit their GDP spending requirements to be in NATO. The US has issues here at home that need to be addressed. The government cares very little about it's tax base in the US. That's all I'm saying, they don't do shit for us here but they print money out of thin air and send it anywhere else.</div>

    <div class="md">A lot of that is just incorrect. Europe has provided significant aid. The nations we're concerned about, bordering Russia, meet or exceed the 2% standard, and corruption is far from exclusive or special in Ukraine. Hyperfocusing on it like they're selling M113s to Iran or something is comical at best.

Yeah we've got issues here. I addressed that, see above. It still has fucking nothing to do with whether we help or not in Ukraine. If you think otherwise, you're wrong. If someone tells you otherwise, they're wrong.</div>

    <div class="md">If you want to know which side is the bad side, look at whoever is cheering on the death and destruction of others. As far as I can tell, and from everything I’ve seen, the Jews, just wanted to be left the fuck alone, and have their hostages returned. 

Perfect example, Ukraine. Look at the videos of all those Russian influencers, celebrating firing, rockets and killing people in the opening days. You shouldn’t be hungry for war, you should not be celebrating it, it should be the last fucking resort. if you’re the one going looking for it, welcoming it, you are the bad guy.

As for the palestinas vs the Jews… the Israelis were not the ones firing rockets blindly into civilian areas. 
 Biggest example we can identify with?: 9/11

 Wanna know who the bad guys are? Look at the ones who were celebrating and crying tears of joy in the streets over 3000 people being murdered.</div>

    <div class="md">Ya, look a little harder, plenty of Jewish officials cheering the destruction in Gaza. Likuds leadership helped prop up Hamas to ensure the conflict would continue.

Most Israelis just want to live in peace. Most people just want to live in peace. Netanyahu and his people have no desire for any peace that involves a palestinian state. Hamas is still worse, but the gap isn't very big.</div>

    <div class="md">The majority of the population of Gaza.

Are. Children.

The median age is 18.

40% are 14.


There might have been more older people but they were already killed, long ago.

If the median age of Gazans is 18, then how many of that 50% of the population voted this year, let alone in the last election?</div>

    <div class="md">...why don't the people who disappear in puffs of pink mist, in front of their children, prepare their children for success... gee, I dunno.

My gender non-presumed dude...

the argument, levied *constantly* is "they voted for their destruction".

In 2005. They voted for their destruction.

50% of people are not even 18. 40% are not even 15. Of the whole population.

The vote was 19 years ago. Do you know of any country that allows fetuses to vote? I don't. In fact, the voting age was 18.  
So now, 50% are not adults. And also, the people who *are* adults need to be 37 or older to even have been eligible.

Fun story, there's kind of an interesting missing demographic in Palestine, for one reason or another. Who knows. Same reason a bunch of kids are raised by their aunts or their grandparents, I guess... Perhaps it's a resurgence of spontaneous human combustion over the past many years?

So whatever you are imagining in the Leave it to Beaver "bootstraps" world you are imagining, it isn't that.</div>

    <div class="md">Weird unprompted gender comment aside, Even though this dates back to 2005 as the start point it's been 20 years. Thousands of rockets fired into Israel. Simply because of their ethnicity and religion. And yet nobody in Palestine has done anything to stop it. If Israel didn't have the power to protect itself everything that happened in Gaza would have happened to them 10 times over. The only reason you get to be on your moral high horse here is the fact that Israel had the iron dome to actually protect people. And even then despite the aggression they didn't invade until Hamas invaded their country, found out about a civilian gathering when they were already in there and went to massacre. If people of Palestine will not root out Hamas, then someone else has to. You cannot reasonably just expect them to tolerate this indefinitely. You're expecting them to tolerate whatever happens to them and not find a permanent solution. How do you justify that?</div>

    <div class="md">First, prove the earnest attempt at complete genocide, specifically by the Palestinian civilians. Not outside countries. Not other Muslims, specifically, how deep into the killing or expropriation of all Jewish land has Palestine gotten, exactly?

And what steps can be taken by Israel?

Deferring to a third party coalition force to do peacekeeping and management of the space between the two, and allowing aid into the region and letting people have regular lives.

It's not fucking hard.

Unless you genocide *all of the Muslim people there* do you think that killing women and children and infants isn't going to radicalize a whole bunch of people with nothing left to lose?

No, of course you haven't. You're either dense or just really want as many brown people to die as possible.</div>

    <div class="md">What do you mean prove? The records of thousands of rockets striking iron dome is public knowledge you could literally Google that right now. The trajectory where they intersect the rockets shows its origin. It's not even possible to pretend otherwise.

As for peacekeeping to mediate if that was an option why did nobody try to peacekeep or mediate the situation for well over 20 years? It's almost like your idealistic views of the world don't apply and other countries don't volunteer to put their people in harm's Way regularly. Who specifically would have done the peacekeeping?

You're worried about radicalizing people when you don't understand. The vast majority of Muslim countries are already radical. That's why women are property, can't get an education and can't vote. Everything you read about Christian extremist is generally baseline in these countries. They will stone LGBT people to death for existing. That's why all of your arguments come down to there should just be peace, and why you try to guilt me by saying I just want brown people to die. I've been a military intelligence analyst for almost a decade. This is the real world. Idealic solutions don't happen just because you want them to. You do not understand the massive, and I cannot emphasize this more massive cultural differences between most countries especially in the Middle East. Radical terrorist group was already empowered. The people made that decision. And you're saying this retaliation for their actions will radicalize them? That boat sailed, completed its trip, return to port, and sailed again. 

You understand nothing of their culture religion the geopolitical region or their values. But you asserted your own privilege moral standings on other people, not understanding how vastly different All people are on earth. Your suggesting the resolution that you want not the resolution they want.</div>

    <div class="md">>What do you mean prove?

Prove ***genocide***. Not "attacks", ***genocide***. That would be either the extermination of a people, the sterilization of a people, the subjugation and suppression of a people to the point of loss of culture and identity, or the removal and expungement of a people from their homeland. How far have Palestinian civilians gotten, there? In the complete decimation/sterilization/land-appropriation of Israel?

Those are the types of things that need to occur when using the word *genocide*, in the global forum. It's a higher bar than "firing rockets at", or it would be used all the damned time, in every damned conflict, every damned where.

>As for peacekeeping to mediate if that was an option why did nobody try to peacekeep or mediate the situation for well over 20 years?

Oh? It's been a lot longer than 20.

And I wonder why. Aren't there a *whole lot of countries saying Israel shouldn't start an incursion into Rafah*? Aren't there a whole bunch of Israelis calling for an end to the retaliation? What has the response been from Netanyahu? What would the response be from him if, oh, I dunno, there were calls to let peacekeepers in, to provide aid... or to deliver supplies and food... or to assess the situation? What would the response be, exactly?

>Who specifically would have done the peacekeeping?

Gee, I have never, ever seen a blue helmet, anywhere, in any part of the world, for any reason.

>You're worried about radicalizing people when you don't understand. The vast majority of Muslim countries are already radical. That's why women are property, can't get an education and can't vote.

Ahh yes. The "brown people need to die, because it's not my preferred god".

And of course it's Muslims, just by virtue of being Muslim. Has nothing to do with authoritarianism or totalitarianism, or using fascist rhetoric to control the population. Yeah, pictures of Iran in 1970 compared to pictures of Iran in 1980... can't tell them apart at all. Not in the least. You are shit at your job if your analysis is fundamentally incapable of assessing what actually happens or why. Got some dumbfuck "it happens there because of Islam but it can't happen literally anywhere else because my book also says to stone people to death but we just fucking aren't yet, magically even if my god says so" logic, there. Yeah it has fundamentally nothing to do with the leaders or political/socioeconomic climate... yeah... Jesus Christ.

>The people made that decision

Use your big analyst brain. Which people. When. What year. What is the current demographic. Why did that decision get made. What factors led to it. C'mon. Big boy thoughts. Cause and effect... did they just wake up one day and say "right, today we are killing every Jewish person on the planet"? There are plenty of Jewish people in Canada. As well as Muslim people in Canada. Why haven't there been more murders of Jewish people? Why hasn't Montreal just become a smoking crater? Isn't it in their genes? Or their religion? Aren't they hard-wired to genocide all Jewish people? And yet, somehow, magically, bars, strip clubs, churches, synagogues, and mosques all magically coexist in Montreal. Is it the poutine? I mean, it's hard to keep poutine kosher, with how much better beef stock is on fries and in gravy, and while not haram, I doubt it's halal in the true spirit of the word... But it is fucking good. Maybe it's the poutine.

    <div class="md">Yes it's easy. You look at the total number of attacks, and if they had hit how much of the population would have been devastated. If a majority of the population would have been devastated statistically you can prove they tried to genocide them. What part are you confused of?

Congratulations on also not answering anything about why somebody would peacekeep. Instead of answering the question you pretended Israel was at fault and tried to redirect The topic unsuccessfully. So I'll restate it again. Your solution was third party peacekeeping. State who would do it and why. You trying to pretend the UN would actually be useful considering they've done nothing and have offered to do nothing to help Israel at any point in the past shows that they aren't a viable option. Let's hear your next choice

Your little quip where you tried to turn it around is nonsensical. You're saying that people are trying to kill brown people because they believe in a different God. The situation is the inverse. This is why people shouldn't form opinions on subjects they're uneducated on.

Okay if Muslim being the state religion has nothing to do with authoritarianism fascism or otherwise, what percentage of Muslim countries give women and LGBT human rights?

As for your question of why it doesn't happen in other countries to Jewish people. It does you just didn't care enough to check. anti-Semitism has been on the rise globally. Another subject you're poorly educated on but still formed an opinion. The difference here is accessibility, they are closer to Israel so that's where they enact their anti-Semitic views. The people in the relevant countries you're talking about are the ones that perpetrate crime against Jewish people because of accessibility there. What other delusions can I shatter for you?</div>

    <div class="md">How about the one where I said anti-Semitism wasn't on the rise.

I saw a whole bunch of anti-Semites in Tennessee the other day.

Same kind that were in Wisconsin, a few months ago, and in Florida in the years before.

Were they all Muslim, too? It was all of the Muslims in Charlottesville, chanting "they will not replace us'"?

Anti-Semitic hate crimes are perpetuated in Europe and North America... largely by... Muslim populations? That's your take? It's all the Muslims causing that to happen? If we just... What... killed all of the Muslim communities around the world there would be no more anti-Semitism? Just gone from the face of the earth? All of it? Wow.

>What part are you confused of?

The part where that is not how genocide works, unless we can count the number of bullets fired per capita and use that to take everyone's guns away.

>Congratulations on also not answering anything about why somebody would peacekeep.

Gee, I have no fucking idea why countries would agree to mediate, versus allowing them to drag entire fucking continental regions into deep political unrest. No fucking clue. Remind me to keep you on speed dial the next time Germany gets uppity and says "we're just going to borrow Austria and Poland and these other countries for a bit". Why would anybody want to mediate that? Why would anybody want to mediate apartheid South Africa? Why would anybody want to mediate China / Taiwan? I dunno. Maybe I am just too soft and both sides should just be nuked off the planet, because Murica. Fuck Yeah!

>Instead of answering the question you pretended Israel was at fault and tried to redirect The topic unsuccessfully

I don't see what control the population of Palestine, currently cowering in the corner in Rafah has in the situation. Mind telling me how they are running the show?

>State who would do it and why. You trying to pretend the UN would actually be useful considering they've done nothing and have offered to do nothing to help Israel at any point in the past shows that they aren't a viable option.

Yes. 0 countries in the UN (how many is that, again?) have offered to provide support, under the banner of the UN. How many UN casualties have there been in Palestine, thus far? But no. Nobody with the UN has ever, never, never ever been anywhere near this conflict, ever.

> “‹The U.K. is considering a push to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations›, Foreign Secretary David Cameron said, as he tries to sell a plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza.”

Nobody is remotely considering getting involved... at all, in the least.

>You're saying that people are trying to kill brown people because they believe in a different God. The situation is the inverse. This is why people shouldn't form opinions on subjects they're uneducated on.

Jesus you are dumb. Profoundly dumb.

>Okay if Muslim being the state religion has nothing to do with authoritarianism fascism or otherwise, what percentage of Muslim countries give women and LGBT human rights?

What was the fucking state religion of Iran, in 1975?

https://www.npr.org/2012/02/16/146977562/foreign-policy-once-upon-a-time-in-tehran

What city is that? Where is that city? What is the fucking state religion?

Guess why I believe in separation of politics and religion. It's not because I believe that one day, Muslims might be elected. It's because I can't trust any right-wing authoritarian fuckers of any kind.

Turns out that Hitler was also bad for the Jews, and up until he started arresting the clergy, he was working with the Protestants as the official religion. Those Protestants must have been secretly Muslim, I guess.</div>

Is this an acceptable solution? 
To me it's that simple. 


Maybe the answer is yes, but let's not pretend it's anything else then that.</div>

    <div class="md">>Most Israelis just want to live in peace. Most people just want to live in peace. Netanyahu and his people have no desire for any peace that involves a palestinian state. Hamas is still worse, but the gap isn't very big.

The PLO warned the West that Palestine wasn't ready to have elections just yet, and Bush forced it through.

An Israeli terrorist murdered the one Israeli leader who had ever made any real progress towards peace, because he didn't like that it undermined his genocidal dream.

Netanyahu green lit the funding of Hamas by Qatar because keeping Palestinians divided undermined their claims to legitimacy.

Hamas is worse, but nobody wants to talk about how the fuck we ended up in this mess.</div>

    <div class="md">How the hell have we sank so far, that Americans are citing with the people that were screaming tears of joy after 9/11? 

Look at all of the Arab nations that surround Gaza. Not a single one, wants to take them in. Why is that? Because they cause internal strife and war and conflicts in every single nation they go into. Look at Jordan for first is sake and the civil war there. 

Look what happened in Kuwait… and when Iraq invaded, they were smart and kick them out because they were sympathizers with the Iraqi govt. 

Everyone says “you should read more” , I agree I should. And I’m not saying the Jews have not done fucked up things because they most certainly have but that is war. Every time the Palestinians haven’t offered peace they have refused. Every… single… time… 

Why? Why not settle for 90% of what it is that you want and then keep trying for more? Why subject your people to the intense suffering? - Because they don’t give a shit. Until the people rise up and overthrow Hamas themselves, it’s going to keep happening. 

I don’t blame the Jews, one bit for wanting to go in and wipe them out considering all the aid that they give them is just used against them. The Palestinians do not want peace. Full fucking stop. They want them eliminated, and they were pissed off because they were about to sign an accord with other Middle Eastern countries to help legitimize them and increase trade in peace. 

They could not let that happen, so they committed one of the worst Jewish atrocities since World War II. 

Now you can argue all you want about Netanyahu and if he actually knew it was gonna happen, and so on so forth… that mf needs to relinquish power, but that is honestly not the main point.</div>

generally agree with your comment, but not with this quote.  If Israel wanted to wipe out the palestinians, they could have done it already 10-fold.  They want to wipe out terrorism, not palestinians.</div>

    <div class="md">"Fourteen hospitals were directly hit. Several, including Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, appeared to have been attacked by Israel."

why would CNN include this line?  Your commentary seems to suggest that 20 hospitals have been "flattened" by israel. This is not the case.

the reason why both CNN and the UN articles are not so quick to blame the IDF explicitly, is because Hamas is making these hospitals legitimate military targets, by fighting out of them, shooting rockets, stockpiling ammo, logistics, etc.

This is a classic move in the Hamas playbook, and its purpose it to get useful idiots to spew propaganda about israel trying to destroy the Gaza health system, when it is truly hamas' doing.  no rational army would not attack these targets.</div>

    <div class="md">Its the equivalent of if native americans, whos families had moved to europe in the 1500s, started migrating to the USA and kicking americans out of their houses, off their farms, into controlled zones with no way to leave, and into concentration camps. I bet you would call any American who fought back freedom fighters if that happened, no matter how many murders, tortures and rapes they committed.


You’re right, the jews in Israel just want to be left alone by the rest of the world so that they can displace, segregate, torture and kill Palestinians with impunity. Im not a fan of Hamas, and you don’t have to be to see that Israel is the instigator in whats going on there. If they simply agreed to treat Palestinians like actual compatriots, to desegregation, and to the return of any land stolen in the last five years then Hamas would end hostilities. But they wont because they have the, frankly disgusting, nerve to think that because a three or four thousand year old book says Israel is their promised land, they have the right to murder and displace  anyone currently on that land to take it.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s okay to say you hate Trump. I’m a conservative and I hate Trump. He’s too anti gun. I liked Ramaswamy a lot. You probably get flak because you aren’t articulating the policies you have a problem with and are talking more about the candidate themselves. Conservatives vote based on reason and liberals vote based on emotion so saying to a conservative that you just don’t like a candidate is not really a reason at all to us. You need to mention what policies you disagree with. I hate that Ramaswamy isn’t a Christian but I don’t vote based on emotion and I like his far more pro gun views. I believe you can be whatever religion you want as long as you have good policies.</div>

    <div class="md">I think you’re thinking about the boomer conservatives. They are the ones who are culty about it. Younger more informed conservatives don’t like him. For the most part I think the conservatives who do want him back in office want him back in just because the liberals hate him so much so we view that as a good sign. But again, I don’t let emotion cloud my judgement, just because my enemies hate Trump doesn’t mean I should like him.</div>

    <div class="md">Ah yes. Let’s just ignore the actual elephant in the room that’s extremist Islam and its dedicated followers bent on killing all Jews. It’s pretty easy to ignore stuff like the Hamas charter calling to kill all Jews, recently revised for the TikTok foreheads. We can also ignore the 6,000+ rockets fired at Israel every year for the last decade+… maybe if we also completely forget Oct 7th.

So yeah, if we ignore all of that and pretend it’s just harmless jokes we can make this work!

    <div class="md">Why can't we just agree that both sides of the current conflict are being (and have historically been) terrible to each other?  They're both trying to massacre each other.  There is no "good guy" in the shit storm going on in Gaza right now.  Just a shit ton of innocent civilians that have been harmed on both sides.  Israeli citizens were attacked and kidnapped in a terrorist assault.  Citizens of Gaza are being massacred in retaliation.  Neither side is right here.  Just a whole bunch of sadness and further anger that will last for the foreseeable future being generated.</div>

    <div class="md">So just because others *may* (it is pointless to presume the actions of others in a similar situation until they are placed there, but that's a different discussion) respond the same way makes this response somehow not abhorrent?  Defending the actions with "well France would have done the same thing!" isn't really a good defense for the significant numbers of civilian death and displacement going on.

I'm not defending Hamas here.  Their attack on October 7th was abhorrent.  Them using their civilians as human shields is abhorrent.  Them stocking up all the supplies purely for their own use and letting their civilians starve is abhorrent.  But none of that means that Israel's tactics in this fight are not also abhorrent.  Bombing hospitals is abhorrent.  Telling civilians to flee to specified refugee camps and then bombing those camps is abhorrent.  An Israeli sniper shooting a grandmother holding her grandson's hand while trying to evacuate is abhorrent.</div>

    <div class="md">The only ones I see constantly trying to shoehorn in inappropriate holocaust comparisons aren't doing so in support of Israel. Why do you think they lead with these nonsensical 'genocide' charges? Nobody would be calling this a genocide if not to take advantage of an opportunity to beat the Jews over the head with more holocaust inversion. Talk about disrespectful to the real horrors.</div>

    <div class="md">I guess it's all Israel's fault Hamas used billions in international aid to arm themself rather than supply food, medicine, fuel to their own people. Hamas dug up Palestinian infrastructure to make rockets from their water pipes. Hamas broke the cease fire in the most brutal way possible. Then Hamas used Palestinian civilians as human shields to gain sympathy from well meaning idiots around the world. That last part is about you.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm literally as pro-peace as they come but realize that some wars are caused by assholes invading places and we need to help. (Pro Ukraine aid because it's less expensive than letting Putin win, pro non-military aid for Gaza and Israel because people are literally dying of dehydration and starvation in the 21st century there)

MarxistMemes is full of a bunch of do-nothing, holier-than-thou fake "leftists" who give the whole movement a bad name and frankly disgust me. Same story with socialism\_101. Genuinely LOOK at their pinned post to see the kinds of clowns they are. They're literally green MAGA.</div>

Are they "cheering for the genocide of Jews" or do they recognize that the Israeli government wants to eradicate the Palestinian peoples and see this as a moral and ethical issue?</div>

    <div class="md">EDIT: All the soy boys whining about my use of the word, "genocide".

Look, Hamas, and their masters in Tehran, want to kill as many Jews as possible. They have stated this. They have repeated this. They launch attacks in oursuit of that goal.

Meanwhile, we have the anti-Israeli crowd who invokes, all the time, that theres a genocide happening in Gaza. Whewn confronted with the absence of facts to substantiate such a claim of genocide, they, again, all the time, whine that there doesnt have to be a showing intent...its just happening.

So, on one side, you have a stated intent, a goal, an objective, to kill as many Jews as possible and eradicate the state of Israel..even if they are really unsuccessful at it. On the other side, you have a nation state that successfully wages war against maniacs that want to kill as many Jews as possible and eradicate the state of Israel.

We all know who is attempting to genocide in this conflict and it aint Israel.</div>

    <div class="md">Correct. Ruling that zionism is  form od genocide is as infamous as the UN's declaraton that zionism is a form of racism, lols.

The irony is that Israel will be in the dock now for years to come. Not China for its mass murder of Uyghurs. Not Syria for massacres of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Not Russia for deliberate bombing of civilians in Ukraine. Only Israel, for its efforts to destroy a terrorist group that killed a thousand civilians in the most brutal ways imaginable on October 7, 2023.

The court did not order Israel to stop fighting and withdraw from Gaza. It did not order a cease-fire. What it did order was described this way by the *New York Times*: “Israel must take action to prevent acts of genocide by its forces in Gaza and must let more aid into the enclave.” And by doing so, it lends credence to every claim of genocide, to every lie that Israel is trying to starve Gazans, to every effort to stop the IDF from defending Israel’s citizens.

In today’s Israeli press, there is a dispute as to whether Prime Minister Netanyahu alone, or the whole cabinet, recently approved the entry into Gaza of [thousands of tons of flour, enough for six months’ supply](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-with-ministers-in-the-dark-netanyahu-okayed-6-months-worth-of-flour-to-gaza/). So much for the idea that Israel wants to starve Gazans or is making war on civilians. But this fact didn’t make it into the “facts” upon which the court relied.

With this ruling, the United Nations system has emboldened and energized antisemitism around the world and added to the dangers facing the world’s only Jewish state. </div>

You committed genocide against everyone who was there before you and then complained about it when one group of people in the entire subcontinent found the strength to resist you.

Like Israel is a settler colonialist project. Saying Jewish people have a special claim to the area because of Kingdom of Judea existed which was conquered by the Babylonians, the Greeks, and finally the Romans is like saying Christians have a claim to it because of the Crusader States. If you count the history of Palestine beginning with the roman province named as such, they've lived there way longer than the kindom of israel ever existed in the first place. 

If they had just built a country thats safe, and just for Jewish people AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO LIVES THERE thats fine. But building an apartheid state where everyone who isnt Jewish is a second class citizen is guaranteed to create endless conflict.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude... Israel offered a two state solution. Your people rejected that and chose apartheid precisely because a system with two sovereign states would be a politically stable and humane solution that would fail to facilitate genocide of the Jews.

Endorsing a one state solution without an apartheid between Israel and Hamas is the same as endorsing the same arrangement between Israel and Nazi Germany. You are literally pro-genocide with only a wallpapering humane platitudes.</div>

    <div class="md">That just assumes that terrorism is innate to Palestinian character, which is fucked up. Its like saying germans are all nazis forever until the end of time and jews can't live with them without an ethnostate to protect them. 


Hamas didn't fall from the sky, just like the IRA, it exists because of a specific history and politics.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude... It's like saying that we are going to demiliterize Germany and remove the NAZI party from power; open a war tribunal and prosecute NAZI collaborators. Which is what we actually did do.

Hamas didn't just drop from the sky. UNRA knowingly funded them and the militarization of Gaza City for many years as they planed this attack. Hamas is just another organisation like any other that had zero difficulty recruiting employees from the general population.

And don't give me that history and politics crap. The same day Israel was reinstated everyone in the entire region started a military campaign to drive them into the sea. Since before they existed until now their behaviour has been identical but somehow you require me to believe that Israel's actions gradually made them this way? What, did Israel build a time machine, go back before they were reinstated and invent the Palestinian identity?</div>

    <div class="md">No. There are people who support the Israeli defence strategy.

There are also plenty of people opposed to their defense strategy but none of them are personally volunteering to conduct "altra-precise high Intel" military operations to provide a concise victory against HAMAS so their armchair opinions are pretty much worthless at best. At worst they are wallpapering over their HAMAS support with empty platitudes. As is the UNRA.</div>

Nuanced opinions on that topic are not welcome there lmao. Either you blindly dick ride isreal and pretend like the hamas attack just happened out of nowhere for no reason, or get lost.</div>

    <div class="md">My country isn’t at war, and Ukraine isn’t an ally. I as an American have zero stake in this conflict. I’m not “aiding the enemy.” I’m opposed to our country being stuck in long term foreign entanglements just as Washington warned against in his farewell address from office. 

This is exactly what I’m talking about when it comes to not being able to hold anti war opinions on Reddit. We get insane neocon/neolibs like yourself that think we’re “aiding the enemy.” I’m not going to support this war and I will not support this war with the lives of our own troops.</div>

    <div class="md">How is Ukraine not an ally? Do you not uphold democracy all over the world? 

You understand that a parallel could easily be drawn with your stance and WW2? 

Saying why should we want to help Poland after Germany invaded? They’re not an ally.

There’s a reason America doesn’t do isolationism any more - the flame of democracy shines bright but is also easy to put out and must be protected at all costs.</div>

    <div class="md">>Ukraine isn’t an ally

Ukraine, as a country completely dependent of western aid, is much more loyal than a mere ally, it's literally your puppet. Seriously, they will do just about anything you guys want as long as you help them. In addition, if you think about day one after the war, you can choose if that area will be your ally Ukraine or it will be your rival Russia.

Of course allowing Russia and China to keep expanding their sphere of influence and in this case even territory at the expense of the USA is an option - no one is legally obliged to help anyone here - but it's objectively not in your interest.

>I will not support this war with the lives of our own troops.

Has anyone ever even hinted that possibility?</div>

    <div class="md">Our own senator said that if we don't send money to Ukraine. US troops may end up on the ground for this conflict. My favorite argument for ukraine is what if China or Russia starts meddling in Mexicos politics and sends weapons and military "advisors" in to support their independence from America. You really think we don't step on their throat within a few days? Like really? Also, america has been at war in the middle east for 20+ years. Why do we get a pass for doing w.e the fuck we want with no consequences or complaint from other nations? Might makes right? Like wtf? Stop trying to virtue signal that oh mah gawd, putin bad man, russia evil those facists..MF we were the bads guys for some poor fuck for the last 20 years...</div>

    <div class="md">His opinion isn't anti-war. Also, I think most Ukraine supporters in the West are anti-war. The problem is Putin and the Russian Federation are pro-war, and so long as they remain pro-War and Ukrainians remain pro-Independence, there will be war. The cessation of hostilities requires one side to capitulate. 

I've not seen any significant presence wishing for the US or NATO to directly intervene since the ill-thought out calls for a no-fly zone.  We're mostly asking our governments to act as a proper arsenal for democracy to stave off the barbarian horde of Russian soldiers and the despotism they bring forth.</div>

Oh wait it does! 

Because the French only helped the US to fuck with London bankers and the British Crown.

    <div class="md">Not to mention in our early democracy your ability to vote was tied to money/property, skin color and having a penis. 

What wasn't fair is that the dudes with 3inchers got the same ability to vote as the heavy hitters (5.1"+). I know I'm super poor and have a micropenis, but one day I'll be a multimillionaire with a large cock. 

(Some people really think and vote this way)</div>

    <div class="md">1. Banned political parties?  Are you talking about pro-Russian parties?  It’s fucking wartime against Russia, why would you allow your enemy to fester within your own borders?  That’s like the US allowing a pro-communist movement during the height of the Cold War(we literally shut down entire countries let alone minor political parties), it doesn’t make pragmatic sense, it’s not realistic. I get that you’ve never lived in a country during genuine wartime because you grew up in a privileged golden age of peace, but still you act as if countries don’t radically lock themselves down during times of war.  

2. Banned religions?  You mean personal sanctions against religious leaders accused of aiding the enemy?  Ukrainian law guarantees freedom of religion, so frankly you pulled this point out of your ass.

3.  LGBT record, like that shits gonna get better if Ukraine falls into Russian control.  The only way to improve that is for Ukraine to survive and grow.  If Ukraine fails, that LGBT record only gets worse so your point is completely moot.

4. Tax stealing scam.  Listen bro I honestly doubt you’ve ever had a security clearance in your fucking life so honestly this is just you schizo ranting because you want to seem like your doing this for America’s best interests and not Putins.  

You unironically hate the US and are desperate to plunge us into WW3 by acting weak on a global stage.</div>

As opposed to the US. Its dual party system that doesn't allow different political parties, catholic/Christians are the only people to ever hold office, and a track record of treating lgbt horribly.</div>

    <div class="md">Lmao I’m flattered you care so much about me that you’d look into my comment history but frankly you’re just not my type.  Are you implying Hamas is a democracy that Israel is destroying lmao apples and oranges dumbass.

I’m pro-humanity, and both Russia and Hamas are war criminal lead terrorist organizations which wil churn through as many human lives as possible for their goals.

Peace through strength, if you can’t fight a war, can’t defend from one either.

As I told the other, being a flawed democracy back when we were a measly 13 colonies, a democracy so flawed only land owners could vote, women couldn’t, and assholes we’re allowed to own other people, did not stop France and Spain from helping us fight the strongest military in the world.

The only way they can improve is if they survive.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes France had its revolution and overthrew its monarchy because we just told ours to go fuck itself and won.  We were literally the rallying cry, the proof of concept, the ultimate catalyst of the French Revolution.  You make it seem like the French Revolution was a bad thing or that the US is even on the verge of such an event lmao.

That thinking will plunge us into war dumbass, it would make our nation look like fucking pussies on the global stage, our alliances, the very things responsible for this golden age of peace we are fortunate enough to live in, would be shaken to their core, Russian and Chinese propaganda will be so glad to prove to their populace that we’re unreliable and weak.  You’re chumming the water for future hostilities.</div>

    <div class="md">We have proven to be weak depending on who our leader is.

Russia moved on Crimea under Obama.

Trump sanctioned the Nordstream pipeline which crippled Russia’s capability.

Biden removed that sanction and Russia once again starts making moves. Now we dump billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars to a country that we have nothing to do with.</div>

    <div class="md">What fuck do you think the US has been doing in the years since Crimea was rolled by an unsuspecting Ukraine?  The war in Ukraine didn’t start in 2022, it stated in 2014 as a Russian proxy war.  Ukraine went from weak bitches who just gave up land without a fight to a nation capable of fighting the full strength of the Russian federation for two years strength in just 8 fucking years, and you bet your ass the US was there every step of the way, including under Trump despite his later deception in withholding weapons to Ukraine and fall towards the Russian sphere of influence.

Trump sanctioned the nord stream 2 pipeline, not nordstream 1.  Even with Biden lifting sanctions as a goodwill gesture, Nordstream 2 never entered operation even till the day it was ultimately destroyed, making your point 100% moot as lifting the sanctions made zero difference, not a single gallon is gas ever did nor ever will go through that pipe.

You lose one election and suddenly you lose all faith in your country and abandon all your fucking values.  What a fucking worthless American you’ve become.  America isn’t weak, we’re the strongest country on earth, you only think we’re weak because you yourself are weak.  Our biggest geopolitical enemy, the biggest nuclear threat in the world, is struggling against that “country we have nothing to do with”, we have some of the largest and most expensive naval loses in the last 80 years, nuclear bombers have been destroyed, thousands of images and videos of irreplaceable and irrecoverable Russian equipment destroyed, intelligence on the capabilities of the military that both Iran and China are founded upon, unlimited weapons testing and data collection.  

It costs us billions, but for Russia it will cost them everything,  they will be nothing more than a Chinese puppet state, they will be weakened beyond repair while the USA and NATO remain nearly completely hands off.  This is the least involved we could possibly be and even that is too much for your pansy ass.  I don’t know about you but I’d rather help Ukraine fight Russia than do it myself and Ukraine is more than happy to as well because it’s either that or slavery.

You are both morally bankrupt and incapable of pragmatism.  You are an American In Name Only.

On the other hand you could really stick it to them by demonstrating a way to use the warehouses of Vietnam era troop carriers and Desert Storm munitions (that we'll no longer have to pay to maintain) to give everyone healthcare.

I mean, and then of course getting some sort of bill for it passed by a house of representatives with a majority party ideologically committed to legislating nothing.</div>

    <div class="md">If there is money to be made then someone will do it. If you have factories and laboratories and employees all set up and trained to invent and manufacture new drugs, you arent going to decide to throw a tantrum and suddenly stop just out of spite because suddenly you cant absolutely scalp and abuse the market any more. There arent enough other markets to go into that are as abusive so at that point it makes more sense to just keep making and inventing drugs.</div>

    <div class="md">Come on, man.

True, we are sending existing equipment and material...that has to be replaced now. How do we pay for those replacement items - deficit dollars. Now, you want to argue that this aid to Ukraine represents money being put back into the economy...yes, after its been borrowed from another country...and thats if the Democrats (who have been screaming since the early 90s that we vastly overspend on the military) will ever support reinvesting in the military to replace this material.</div>

    <div class="md">Rather than imagining what I think, ask a question. Unlike the majority of virtue signalers around here that want to only send surplus equipment while talking a big game about sanctions and permitting Putin to veto our response, I do think that the US ought to be directly involved, both with the Navy and Air Force. I do think that we should have been transferrring F16s more than a year ago with the commensurate training and should have been pushing our NATO allies top do the same and to push tier 1 tanks into Ukraine as well.

Why? Because the US made a strong commitment, that Obama first and now Biden have reneged on, wherein in exchange for de-nuclearization that we would gurantee their national security. 

Lastly, Ukraine was not an "ally", not even in 2012 when Russia first invaded and Obama turned his back. Ukraine is nearly a third world country mired with unteneable corruption. We made a deal with them when the old USSR broke apart. That and ht efact that we ought to want to stop Putin in his tracks is why we should be helping Ukraine...again, not with sheleved weapons, but with contemporary systems and US assets.</div>

    <div class="md">Your desire for direct involvement directly contradicts with OPs desire for reduced national debt.  However I can’t say I disagree with your stance on giving more serious support.  I think ultimately it’s a propaganda thing, for example the Abrams tank has such an amazing record, however if one blows up, that image gets spread across the world.  US forces never lost a Abrams in combat I believe, but the photos of the few Abrams that were destroyed while in Saudi Arabian hands are still circulating propaganda channels.

There was a time when the USA was a young deeply flawed democracy facing off against the strongest military in the world, and because of the assistance from foreign Allies the US survived to build itself.  Ukraine is a flawed country, if you watch the Ukrainian president’s TV show that got him elected it’s literally like 35 episodes of him being pissed off and getting constantly screwed over at all the unending corruption in the country he is now the leader of.

Ukraine deserves the chance to become more than the flaws of their roots, and they are paying a lot of blood for that chance.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh it’s not just Hamilton that thinks you’re a pussy ass bitch, you should hear what Reagan had to say to pussy ass bitches who thought appeasing the Soviets was a good idea.



“Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy "accommodation." And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer - not an easy answer but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right.

We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, "Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." Alexander Hamilton said, "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace - and you can have it in the next second - surrender.

Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face, that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what then, when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better Red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet." And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.

You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin - just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.

You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, "There is a price we will not pay." "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." And this - this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's "peace through strength." Winston Churchill said, "The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits - not animals." And he said, "There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty."

You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.

We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.”  -Ronald Reagan October 27 1964</div>

    <div class="md">The vast majority of the equipment being sent to Ukraine is old and doesn’t need to be replaced, such as the old M1’s and some of the Air Defense systems being sent.

And much of the equipment that isn’t old would need to be replaced anyway, a lot of military equipment has expiration dates and would just be scrapped if not used, most notably missiles and the powder charges for artillery shells do have expiration dates and will be thrown away if not used by a certain date.</div>

    <div class="md">We used to stay out of these kinds of conflicts. Pearl Harbor was not a fun time though. Capitulation to dictators and strongmen ultimately comes back to bite the USA. And helping people defend their homeland from invasion is morally the right thing to do. Beyond that my point was that we’re not just throwing away this money. It does go back into our economy.

    <div class="md">But capitulation assumes an authority or high ground.  We blew up a Russian natural gas pipeline, then immediately assumed the #1 provider of LNG to the European Union, that's not very cricket.

Spurious to suggest that Kremlin would sucker punch u.s. territory.  Pearl Harbor happened in a pre nuclear world.

In my view, an organization of, "collective security against the Soviet Union" has served its purpose. That is to say, NATO should have dissolved an appropriate time after the Soviet Union's dissolution. Therefore we should seek to minimize, rather than accelerate related military entanglements. 

I'm not convinced of your claim that Pearl Harbor was a 'capitulation to strongmen' coming to bite us in the ass. If it always happens, as you claim, can you give a second example of a strongman ass-bite?</div>

    <div class="md">Wait are you referring to Nord Steam? As the perpetrator is still unknown for that. In fact the USA WARNED of possible sabotage weeks before hand. But if you’re going to commit a false flag attack it makes sense to warn the people you’re hitting well in advance right? As for when it’s come back to bite us. I mean the entire point of USA foreign policy in the 2010s was the appeasement of Putin in order to keep him from doing exactly what he is currently doing. And of course appeasing hitler worked out historically so well. Although I guess it was better than the Russians, who were allied with him</div>

    <div class="md">Sorry that was typed misleadingly. I was referring to this round of aid. And I don’t count humanitarian aid as I would consider preventing a mass famine or other humanitarian disaster a pretty high priority and something that would be happening anyway regardless of reason. The money we have sent Ukraine is still a tiny part of our gdp and not enough to provide free healthcare. Pretending like free healthcare is due to defending democracy and not from people voting against free healthcare is just shifting blame</div>

    <div class="md">I highly recommend you take a look at people’s profiles when you see controversial opinions like this considering it’s an American election year and trolls are out in force. One look at OP’s and you’ll see that his last several posts have been Russian talking points and one was even directly sucking Putin’s dick.</div>

    <div class="md">While a number of his posts are rather pro-Russian, this one here I don’t see the Russian connection. The comment in the post seems to be moreso a conservative opinion. It’s relatively common for conservatives to think the U.S. should spend more on itself and less so on other countries. While im not going to say whether that is right or wrong, I can say that this specific comment is not “Russian propaganda”. If you want some examples of actual Russian propaganda I recommend reading some of the outlandish things Dmitry Medvedev has said.</div>

    <div class="md">The closest thing the Russians have said is that they think the US should mind its own business, which doesn’t have the same connotations as what OP is saying and therefore is still merely a conservative viewpoint. Russians think the US is sticking their nose in other countries’ business whereas OP is calling for America to put “America first” as the republicans say. The fact that he is British doesn’t really change the fact that anyone can have opinions on how other countries conduct domestic and foreign policy.</div>

And weirdly enough this is not the only pro-Russia talking point he has been spouting.

The idea that we need to specifically end Ukraine funding because of problems in the US has been a Russian talking point since the beginning of the war.

It seems like he's getting away with posting a lot of garbage and misinformation on his page already, even without your approval.

The front page of [yerMawsOnFurlough\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/yerMawsOnFurlough_/) 's post historyincludes:  


-Conspiracy theory claiming only celebrities control public opinion in government and not politicians

-COVID memes about putting masks on babies immediately born

-Wishing Trump was elected

    <div class="md">Any honest person would first note Trumps military budget increases, the largest in peacetime history, have so far cost an additional trillion dollars. That's 20x more than has been spent in Ukraine, in exchange for no battlefield effect, just peacetime funneling of fuind into the military industrial complex. 

If your concern was taxpayer money being wasted in military, that would be your first target, not the money spent on ukraine, which is arguably the best military deal in history, and in any event a tiny fraction of Trumps spending.</div>

    <div class="md">We’re also financially supporting their entire government. I suppose that came out of the military budget as well? Out of the 75.4 Billion that we’ve sent them. Approximately 30 billion of that isn’t even related to military spending. And the US would have been just as secure if Ukraine fell to Russia. Russia is not trying to invade us. They’re also not fool enough to mess with a nato country, which Ukraine is not. So please, what treaty out here justifies sending 75.4 billion dollars worth of aid to a wildly corrupt country? Would that money not be better served addressing the needs of the American people through strengthening our borders and maybe actually fixing the healthcare system? 

I understand the argument of weakening our rival through a proxy, but I argue to what end? Who honestly gives a shit about whether these Russians and Ukrainians are killing each other? When does pouring money into neverending wars in foreign lands stop? It’d also be a lot easier to buy that horseshit excuse of sending old equipment we were gonna replace if the government hadn’t abandoned billions of dollars worth of said equipment in Afghanistan. No, there’s efficient defensive spending and then there’s just flagrant waste with the intention of writing it off on the American taxpayer in the end and quite frankly I find that insanely insulting.</div>

    <div class="md">Where do you think military equipment comes from/gets paid for by? It’s the American taxpayer.. Biden might not be handing them a pallet of 100 dollars bills but he may as well be  because it’s all funded by American tax dollars. It doesn’t matter what Ukraine actually recieves, it matters that if they receive so much as 1 item it has been paid for 100% by the American taxpayer. The government does not and has never made a single cent on its own.</div>

    <div class="md">Being rude and pretending everyone who disagrees with you is a ‘lying shill’ just makes you look desperate.

If you really want to convince me and other supporters of the west to your cause, it would be a lot more effective to simply show an article proving one of my points incorrect, or debate me cordially.

Acting like this puts people on the defensive, which (while satisfying or allies) only strengthens the opinion of the other side against you

Cheers!</div>

    <div class="md">Realistically, defense spending does go into the pockets of Americans. No one wants to admit that GDP increases during war. Redditors want to believe that money given to Lockheed disappears into billion pockets, but Lockheed directly employs 115,000 people, and indirectly benefits tens of thousands more. And that's just one company.</div>

Countries that are in NATO are our allies and we have an obligation to defend them. Ukraine is not in NATO. They have a long history of corruption almost as bad as Russia itself. They don’t get to suddenly retroactively join NATO after having contributed nothing.</div>

    <div class="md">Educated is apparently a relative term these days too. Are you not aware of how much the US puts into homeless programs, infrastructure, etc? Maybe do some research. I mean if you’re going to make a coherent argument at least make it logical and do your homework. No one is sending buckets on money to Ukraine either, we’re sending old weapons and equipment which is creating jobs in the US and putting money back into our economy because it’s being replaced by equipment manufactured in the US.</div>

    <div class="md">We have sent about $70 billion in aid to date and most of that was not weaponry.

We send an additional ~$60 billion a year to other countries in foreign aid. Yes, spending more on infrastructure and housing alone is not going to fix all our issues as there is waste and abuse of funds. However, at a minimum even not spending that money at all means less taxes and less inflation.</div>

    <div class="md">I didn’t prove shit.

But your profile proves you’re just another dumbass pretending to have all the answers.

I’m just sick of idiots like you, it’s that simple, the only point being proven is this country is tired of listening to braindead morons like you who can only point fingers instead of actually debating in good faith.

The republican party is currently the laughing stock of the world.</div>

    <div class="md">Real world knowledge? Russia invaded Ukraine, if they wanna defend themselves they should. Us arming them does not prolong the war, it prolongs their survival. America acts in bad faith all the time. That doesn’t mean Russia doesn’t have far worse intentions, they’re just less powerful. I don’t gloat, it’s a horrific war that hurts Ukrainians and Russians.

However, the "i want decent healthcare and shit" isn't mutually exclusive.  We can do both.  We just dont because there's money to made for rich people in not having good healthcare.</div>

    <div class="md">friendly reminder hat it doesnt matter if ukraine is in nato. It still benefits us to support them and weaken russia. We could also choose to leave Nato if we wanted, then we have no obligation to help anyone. But **should** we do that? No, it is beneficial to weaken potential adversaries while they are still overseas. If we waited until someone threatened the homeland directly we would be fucked. If a country is able to threaten/attack the US homeland then they messed up a long time ago.</div>

    <div class="md">Our allies in NATO fucking care and if they get dragged into war, so do we.

It's as simple as that.  Provide aid to Ukraine specifically so that the war STAYS in Ukraine and does not spill over to Poland or Romania, Latvia, Bulgaria, etc.</div>

    <div class="md">This is the answer.

The reason why we're able to discuss anti-war sentiments and bitch about where our money is and is not going is specifically because our money has gone into projecting our military power in regions across the globe and keeping those conflicts there and keeping them minimized as best as possible.

An uncontained conflict pulls in our allies and means that people here get sent overseas to actually fight and with how our recruiting goals are going, a draft may become a reality making that overseas conflict really fucking real for many young people here.</div>

We could end the war in Ukraine tomorrow if we wanted to. We won't, because it keeps Russia bogged down.

Also You.

Usually when someone starts threatening you with their imaginary internet friends, it's from their moms basement.

That's not a parallel and it shouldn't concern us because Ukraine has nothing to do with our interest.

They can do whatever they want without my money.

    <div class="md">Ukraine is nearly 5,000 miles from Washington DC, across the Atlantic, and nearly across another continent. It's historically Russian, was part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, has almost no ties to the West, is almost entirely interior, and other than being next to Russia, has no strategic value to us. 

The idea that we need to somehow forcefully address Russian aggression is equally ludicrous. Russia isn't even close to a threat. The Russian economy is less than $2T in GDP, the EU is 20. Between the US and the EU our economies are more than 20x the size of Russia. Russia has 120 million citizens and NATO has nearly a billion. 

This is a fucking border war that we stuck our noses into because what the fuck does anyone in DC have to do if they ain't killing someone?</div>

    <div class="md">Why would this prove your point, the actors are the same.

But the answer is 2014 was murkier, some little green men taking over russian speaking enclaves vs. The Russian army invading with the explicit goal of taking the entire country. I agree though, we should have lifted a finger in 2014!</div>

    <div class="md">Joining NATO is voluntary. The countries near Russia join NATO specifically to protect themselves against Russia. Ukraine didn't, and now here we are.  


And don't even get me started with the bullshit 'Russia had to invade Ukraine cus it was gonna join NATO', because  


* Countries with active territorial disputes cannot join NATO, and Russia has been occupying parts of Ukraine since 2014  

* If that *was* the objective, they failed, because their invasion caused two other countries to join NATO, and now almost every NATO country is engaging in significant rearmament. NATO is stronger than ever, *specifically because Russia decided to be the bully NATO was created to defend against.*</div>

    <div class="md">Because you agenda is clear. It’s not one or the other and every honest person knows that.

    <div class="md">You deserved this one. Your comment is especially dumb. Ukraine aid has literally no impact on your healthcare. The gov could give you whatever healthcare it wants at any moment - and aiding Ukraine would make absolutely no difference.

You are pushing Russian propaganda. 

I hope you realize that Putin is the 21st century's modern day Hitler. You are amongst the same crowd that protested us sending aid to the allies during WW2. You are literally amongst the worst people in history. Idk what else to say.</div>

Notice Russia has mainly sent prisoners (they’re not crying about clearing the national penitentiaries and having them murdered. Russia has an all time surplus of cash.

    <div class="md">The post is referring to foreign policy and you're commenting about a domestic issue. I think a ban is overkill but it might help you to understand that not just for reddit discussions but in day to day life.

They aren't dropping bags of cash at Zelenskyy's house right? The aid is in various forms which you can easily find them broken down if you read the aid packages. 

A large portion ($20b) is in the forms of weapons and equipment from Defense Department inventory we're planning to phase out. Another large chunk ($14b) is allocated for purchase of new items from US firms and the last big piece ($15b) is US support via training, Intel, etc. 

If you're concerned about health care in America which is a completely different issue (see false equivalence) I would vote for politicians and the party that supports domestic Healthcare improvements.</div>

    <div class="md">Okay but a free and independent Ukraine DOES benefit you. It’s not as simple as ‘money to other countries = bad’ 

Not only does a free and independent Ukraine prevent Russia from having a stranglehold on tons of prices around food, it also sends a signal to China around Taiwan…which currently has the best technology in the world around semiconductors and is crucial to security for everyone, and particularly the USA. 

I’m not saying they were right to ban you - clearly that’s wrong - but I am curious as to why you’re so invested in not helping a country that is an ally and that really needs our help? There are much better ways to get that money - raising taxes so that Amazon doesn’t pay 0 a year seems like a good place to start for example? 

Truly not trying to be argumentative; I’m genuinely curious where you’re coming from.</div>

    <div class="md">the US sending more money to a foreign country then helping you know, ourselves first is wild to me. reddit is a far left liberalist hellhole while twitter is a far right conservative hellhole. i get backlash on both because i dare agree with certain points on both sides. however this is one of the times where im more red leaning on, because people here in the us are homeless, starving and dying in the streets, san francisco is still covered in HUMAN FECES that only gets cleaned when a communist dictator shows up. things like that need to be fixed</div>

    <div class="md">Aside from the fact that military aid isn't cash infusions and isn't a factor of the actual budget of the country but instead a release of surplus and already produced (and paid for) assets to the partner country, usually with an accompanying debt, that frees up space for manufacturers to continue to manufacture those assets (and keep people working), its ridiculous that you were banned. I got a ban for "Misinformation" after I listed a number of countries without constitutional protections for freedom of speech, because letting people know that American Liberal Democracy is simply one flavor of democracy in a sea of other OECD countries is misinformation.</div>

    <div class="md">Because you're parroting useless bullshit that the right likes to echo while in the other hand they'll refuse to vote for any healthcare aid, any veteran or homeless aid, or any other shit that would actually help us out. The Ukraine war aid is spent against our defense budget which is already astronomical; If you're against the war aid then you're indirectly against our defense budget which is not something Republicans are willing to admit either.</div>

    <div class="md">The equipment thats being given as aid is already there. We are not procuring MORE stuff (well we are, but we would do this anyways after we decommission this stuff, so its either decommission the equipment or like. u know, actually use it). Moreover, and this is the real fun part, a lot of this equipment would have to be decommissioned anyways after it reaches a certain point. The US military has certain levels of shit that it will keep, whats being given away is literally the surplus. There is still a HUGE amount of shit that is earmarked for just US use, that stuff is NOT given away. 

Even past all this, its not like the US cant do both. We can. We are quite frankly rich af. And honestly thats a lot more infuriating than what most people think is happening. 

Like its not that we are being forced to choose between helping a good cause (and it is a VERY good cause) or healthcare, its that certain people and groups in the government are just dicks and they do not *want* to give better healthcare. Prolly cuz it would make them less money. Which is maddening.</div>

    <div class="md">I promise you that the Ukraine Aid is not why you don't have Healthcare, you are thinking of Private Military Contractors. They are not just giving Ukraine Pallets and pallets of cash straight from the US Budget, alright?

There's really no legitimate reason to be against supporting Ukraine, it's good for us Geopolitically, it's good for us economically, it's just a good thing to do.

The only reason I would imagine people here could summon up to be anti-ukraine aid is "But American Imperialism bad doe" when giving aid to a struggling nation that BEGS us for aid is about the furthest thing from "Evil American Imperialism TM" as you can get.

Either that or they are Vatniks and unironically want Russia to rule the world, so there's that.</div>

    <div class="md">There's short-term and long-term benefit. The short-term view, which many in the US have is inflation is bad, my grocery prices went up, and we need to fix this. 

The long-term view, is that Putin has made it clear he wants to invade Europe. He wants to expand his empire and is willing to sacrifice millions of Russians to get it. Ukraine is the first line of defense. After Ukraine come the Baltics, Poland, and general Europe. If the Western nations don't hold the line now there will be a full ww3. Then all hell will break out, drafts amongst other things, and people will be really pissed. 

Now it's clear why earlier Trump wants out of NATO, and the general maneuvering happening with totalitarian governments. I'm not sure what Putin did/has on these people but it's remarkable to see them all goose step in line.</div>

This is an account that constantly spams this at every opportunity. From his profile he is also not even American.

Probably was banned because they were tired of his bullshit.</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t know about banning, but that is a bit of a ridiculous false dilemma you were peddling.

The US is not sending Ukraine suitcases full of cash that  would have otherwise been destined for things like healthcare. 

Much of the value of the aid sent to Ukraine, is made up of the monetary value of the military hardware and weaponry sent, plus the cost to replace US stocks. 

So unless you can think of a medical application for HIMARs rockets and infantry fighting vehicles, the point was a bit of a ridiculous one to make. 

You kinda asked for that one.</div>

I told him in a comment "fuck around and I find out". Reddit after 2 appeals said I "promoted violence" and refused to see it any other way lol. 1 week later on this account, found a guy saying he wants readsit to be purchased by Elon musk to protect the "freedom of speech" we have hear on Reddit (lol).

    <div class="md">I know this is kinda unrelated, but just FYI the $60bn in aid to Ukraine isn't like a transfer of funds or something similar. The vast majority of that aid comes in the from of old US military equipment that was sitting around waiting to be scrapped. It actually ends up being cheaper to send this stuff to Ukraine than it would be for the government to pay to have all this old equipment decommissioned. The number quoted is just the monetary value the equipment had when it was new.</div>

    <div class="md">Of course, you were banned for saying something sensible.

Does anyone know how much of that bill will actually end up in Ukraine? Most likely, like the immigration bill, a singificant part of the spending is unrelated tothe stated intent of the bill at all.

Here's the thing, though...all of this "support" is actually just cover for not wanting to confront Russia. Sure, these politicians will rage on about how bad Putin is and how destabilizing the war in Ukraine is, but Putin has already vetoed any opportunity for the US to be squarely involved. That these politicians are only willing to do as much as Putin permits them to is, well, a derelicitoon of their offices and duty.

The second, and worse part, is that it is these same people who have gutted the US military. We couldnt muster a sufficient strength of arms to do anything meaningful anyway. Such a shame that they talk a good game about the danger Putin represents but because of their policies and spending priorities have sapped any ability to do anything meaningful anyway.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s more straightforward than that. This goes for your other comment as well:

Russia is led by a dictator who is intent on subjugating Ukrainians ( who he does not believe are a real people). They don’t want that, and are willing to fight him over it. I think that’s worth 6 percent of our *military budget* to support.

The question is more: why does this bother you so much? It’s definitely not proportionate to the amount of money we spend on it</div>

    <div class="md">Well, literally why the Russians are so skittish about NATO going right up to their border is they are like repeatedly invaded from their western frontier and it they always end up winning but it is never pleasant for them.   


I think if 80 years ago a couple million people rolled through your western frontier and murdered like 27 million of your countrymen you might be a little skittish about who your neighbors are.</div>

    <div class="md">So you seriously can’t comprehend how it is so provocative and threatening to Russia? NATO was created at the beginning of the cold war to defend against a possible Soviet attack. The USSR collapses and now what is NATO for? Who is left to defend against? Despite their lack of purpose NATO moves closer and closer to Russia. Now I don’t know but a military alliance with no clear purpose moving closer and closer would seem pretty threatening. And now Ukraine. Western military bases potentially being placed in a prime position to drive into the very heart of Russia. Just because you say its in self defense doesn’t change the fact you got a gun to their head.</div>

    <div class="md">You should listen to what the person who invaded actually says, because most of the time it’s straightforward language about Ukraine being a fake vassal country whose people belong to Russia, with the occasional “oh btw it’s really about nato” which apparently suffices to convince people like you. Not to mention, Ukraine wasn’t particularly close to joining nato (and in fact couldn’t based on crimea’s situation post 2014).

Also, answer my question, in your hypothetical, by stop it, you mean destroy Mexico and take its people? Because, obviously and unequivocally no lmao. Even in your own wishfully made up hypothetical, Russia is wrong.</div>

This is merely one of many articles about Russian Ukrainian negotiations that took place in March 2022. Essentially, the main terms of the failed agreement support it being about NATO and not ethnicity or historical claims. Sure Putin may say those things, but here are what his actions tell us. It is indeed about the threat posed by NATO.</div>

    <div class="md">What on earth is intellinews? This reads like a complete farce lol. Per the article, everyone actually involved was ready for a peace deal with comical terms and then the prime minister of the uk said, as quoted in the article, “let’s not sign anything with them at all and let’s just go to war” so Ukraine said yes master and fought. Do you really believe this shit?

Please do find the many other sources that aren’t transparent garbage.</div>

    <div class="md">Then you don't get to invade Mexico and violate their national sovereignty, no. And if Mexico thought they could get more out of an alliance from China than their neighbor, the US, that says a lot more about the US than it does Mexico.  
  
Also, you realize NATO is a defensive alliance, right? One NATO country can't just start wars and expect to have the support of all of it's neighbors. If Putin is worried about NATO attacking, then his problem is with the holes in his brain, not NATO missile installations. 

God, you're such a useful moron for the kremlin, lol. Are you doing this for free? Because then you're even dumber than I thought.</div>
