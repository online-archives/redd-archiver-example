    <div class="md">Dude, there are so many seemingly apolitical subs on reddit that turn out have very political subtexts enforced by mods I've concluded that this is not by accident and these aren't all seemingly random people who happen to be mods, but rather this is a coordinated standard operating procedure of Reddit as a whole to absolutely drive a narrative into the fabric of this social media platform. 

I sub to 3dprinting....3d fucking printing. A couple of months ago there was an event peddled by Adam Savage for some PC organization asking for "makers" (people who make things) to print a piece of a large bust and mail it to them. These pieces would all be put together to form a bust of Rosey the Riveter.  Everyone was excited....it was Adam Savage. Who doesn't respect him? Well, turns out that in the text on this organizations website they specifically say that (paraphrasing) this event isn't for men. Men could contribute, but they really didn't want to hear anything men had to say and it wasn't clear their contributions would be accepted because the event was to promote women and transkin in the community. So, I, like many others in the maker community was calling this out as needlessly divisive. We all want to see more people in this community, but not if those of us who are men are expected to sit in the corner and speak only when spoken to....right? I mean, what's wrong with pointing out the blatant misandric bigotry that absolutely would not be tolerated by reddit if it were misogyny. Right?

Fast forward to like a 3 weeks ago and a 3dprinting mod takes issue with something I said and then brings up my commentary about the Rosey the Riveter bullshit. Obviously this person has tagged me and is holding a grudge. Ends up I get a 3 day ban on 3dprinting and am muted because I called this person out on their bullshit. 

I can't fucking wait to find another platform where maybe this PC bullshit doesn't exist.</div>

    <div class="md">Thank you so much for writing all that. 

It is a brilliant example of how a bullshit narrative is being driven in a chamber of like minded morons.

Their own stupidity (Admins and Mods) drives alternate behaviours, e.g. /r/cringeanarchy used to be a sub about Neckbeards, now it's changed to a heavily right leaning sub.

The more they push the more people will resist.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree, it is disgusting that your mere subscription or participation in one subreddit can silence you in other reddits. This is what reddit wants though. The CEO of reddit was caught surreptitiously editing peoples comments during the US election, trying to influence the election toward the democrats. He was not removed, but they can't shut up about cleansing "Russian Bots" from the platform. What does that tell you? Vote with your wallet (it's your eyes they're selling, by exposing you to advertising) and go somewhere else. This place is not a 'neutral public forum.' I'm not sure it ever claimed to be. It's a cesspool.</div>
