    <div class="md">/r/politics has been a complete shit show for a while.  It was removed as a default sub in 2013 and is supposed to be excluded from /r/popular.

I've also experience first hand the battle cry of "foreign interference" to justify suppressing opinions.  In this case decussion of the recent great Facebook purge in /r/technology.

I recommend trying /r/neutralpolitics if you're interested in in politics decussion.</div>

    <div class="md">I personally haven't had a problem there.  The one thing I like is that each top level comment needs to cite sources so you have much less opinion driven discussion over there.


Also they explicitly state their goal is not neutrality.  At least they are honest about it.</div>

    <div class="md">forget this at your own peril. There is very little on this site now(other than in the smaller or niche subs) that was decided by the userbase. It is no different than going to any news website now - when you go to Fox, you see what Fox wants you to see - when you go to CNN/MSNBC/ETC you see what they want you to see, read what they want you to read and think about stories the way they want you to think about those stories.

    <div class="md">I hate to say it, but actual intelligent debate died a long time ago on reddit. Probably about 9 years ago I could have a debate with center-left libertarian types on /r/politics and others. I actually learned a lot from them. 

Nowadays politics aren't debated on reddit with the exception of a few heavily moderated subs. What actually happens is users try to prove that their "opponent" is their moral inferior, or a bigot of some form, or what ever other undesirable label. 

I used to talk about politics on a lot of subs. I have come to realize that it's just not possible to convince anybody of anything on reddit since users will stubbornly stay their ground and try to do anything possible to make themselves look correct. Not prove anything about their world view. Make themselves look correct. 

Therefor just pick a sub that you agree with and lurk. Don't comment. It's the best way to do politics on reddit.</div>
