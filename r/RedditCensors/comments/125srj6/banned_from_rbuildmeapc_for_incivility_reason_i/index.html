    <div class="md">Oddly enough, digg pulled this type of thing about a decade ago, and to much lesser of a degree than reddit is doing now.

Most people abandoned digg, and went to reddit.  I don't know where people from reddit can flee to, now. I originally liked it for the text-based no-nonsense sort of newsgroups layout, but it's turned into a total nightmare.  I don't know what has become of "left wing" politics on this site, but it doesn't match anything I see with anybody I know in person.  It's like a very small group of people are controlling the narrative of what they want people to think, and believe.</div>

    <div class="md">I learned that a decade ago the largest traffic on Reddit originated from Elgin Airforce base. The troops there were using Reddit to manipulate public perception through social media. Reddit scrubbed all mention off it, but screenshots are still on the internet.

I don’t think it is liberal vs conservative as much as mods have all the power and there are definitely mods in key subs who push certain mainstream agendas. Anything Pro trump, anti vaccine, questioning covid, questioning anything trans or other topics will almost always be censored and likely result in a ban.</div>

    <div class="md">It’t actually Eglin Air Force base. I think I saw something on it on Instagram.  
An internet search for ‘Eglin Air Force base Reddit’ will bring up a number of links.
Looks like a Reddit search for Eglin Air Force base also pulls up people talking about it..

I’ve also heard from a number of sources that many mods on worldnews are not exactly civilians…. But haven’t verified that.</div>

    <div class="md">That sub is part of the circle of default subs with general/neutral sounding names/descriptions that are really toxic political garbage.

You can say you respectfully disagree with someone, and get permabanned for "incivility" by a mod team with the communication skills of a toddler, while a dozen people respond to you in a cursing/raging conniption fit, and that crap stays up. 

Other generic default piss-bucket "I'm neutral" subs off the top of my head include news, todayilearned, teachers, justiceserved, instantkarma, politics, entertainment, music, greenandpleasant, happy(lol irony, some of the most bitter mods, ever), antiwork, explainlikeimfive, askreddit, whitepeopletwitter/blackpeopletwitter... There's several more, I'm s ure.</div>

    <div class="md">Great resource, although, it would be nice if they fixed it a bit better to keep most of the "removed within 5 seconds so not available" stuff.  Even better would be a p2p network allowing people to continue to comment on such threads of removed/locked stuff.</div>
