    <div class="md">I don't have any messages from you - just a ban with no reply.

You muted me and then stalked me here to "give more context" also?

Look, I'm happy to have a conversation with you about the ban, but lashing out at me because your automod made a mistake is absolutely ridiculous.

Let's recap what happened:

---

1. You "accidentally censored my comment" - oops, you made a mistake.

2. I noticed, messaged you about it, didn't receive a response, so posted another comment with links removed.

3. You showed back up, reviewed my comment, recognized your mistake

4. And then got mad at me for pointing out that my comment was shadow-deleted and banned me?

5. Then you stalked me to this post to "give more context"? 🙄

How is mentioning that my comment was censored (**when it was**) "being petulant?"

It's crazy how you guys power trip - this is probably the best example of it I've seen.

**Edit: Unbelievable... mod stalked me here to "give context" and then deleted their comment. What a trip.**

Out of respect for their privacy, I won't post their name, but [here's the "context" they gave](https://i.imgur.com/mxTn55U.png) (this never showed up in my inbox).

"*We're going to censor you because we accidentally censored you and you pointed it out.*"

Crazy!</div>

    <div class="md">I had no idea comments were shadow-deleted for posting any links.

I am used to comments getting shadow-deleted for ??? reasons so I try to repost and figure out what I said wrong in case I got caught in an auto filter.

It's hard to tell if it was deleted by a person or automod because I post and come back 20 minutes later and it's gone... then I post again and it goes through.

In this case I edited my repost to say, "My comment was reinstated below" with a link and (I guess) automod removed that one too (which had more upvotes).

What doesn't make any sense is a mod getting mad at me for mentioning that my comment was censored when I have no idea why it happened in the first place.

I mean, I don't mind them getting annoyed, but then censoring all my comments because I complained about my comments being censored? Banning me...?

Then stalking me into the RedditCensors sub to "add context" after muting me?

Just... why?</div>

I do know that reveddit.com has a method for notifying when a comment gets removed even when there's no private message.  (I haven't set it up for myself because I haven't had that problem *yet*.)

Just out of curiosity about that user that harassed you here, does he moderate multiple communities?</div>
