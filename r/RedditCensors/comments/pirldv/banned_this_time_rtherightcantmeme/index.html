&gt;Libs are dumb for not eating horse medicine

Ivermectin has two forms, one for humans and one for animals. Ivermectin is FDA approved for the treatment of parasites in humans, is on the WHO list of essential medicines, the creators won the Noble Prize, and it has been prescribed for years to not just treat parasites, but also to treat viruses in humans, including Zika and influenza. Like many drugs that are developed for one use, scientists and doctors later discover another use for that same drug. This is why Ivermectin has been called a "wonder drug." It is also being used right now by doctors all around the world to treat Covid in human patients and is going through clinical trials to prove its effectiveness. Suggesting that Ivermectin is "horse medicine" and doesn't work on humans to treat viruses is misinformation. I can understand the confusion on the part of people who get their information from /r/politics, Vice News, Rolling Stone, and their Facebook feed, though. 

&gt;Ivermectin proposes many potentials effects to treat a range of diseases, with its antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-cancer properties as a wonder drug. It is highly effective against many microorganisms including some viruses. In this comprehensive systematic review, antiviral effects of ivermectin are summarized including in vitro and in vivo studies over the past 50 years. Several studies reported antiviral effects of ivermectin on RNA viruses such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Hendra, Newcastle, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Semliki Forest, Sindbis, Avian influenza A, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, Human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Furthermore, there are some studies showing antiviral effects of ivermectin against DNA viruses such as Equine herpes type 1, BK polyomavirus, pseudorabies, porcine circovirus 2, and bovine herpesvirus 1. Ivermectin plays a role in several biological mechanisms, therefore it could serve as a potential candidate in the treatment of a wide range of viruses including COVID-19 as well as other types of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. In vivo studies of animal models revealed a broad range of antiviral effects of ivermectin, however, clinical trials are necessary to appraise the potential efficacy of ivermectin in clinical setting.

More proof that what they mean when they say "Follow the science" is just "Listen to the State and do what the TV says."

As always, people should consult their doctors before taking any medication or receiving any kind of treatment, and they definitely should not take anything formulated for animals or do something just because the TV and the government told them to.</div>

    <div class="md">Those subbredits are always a bunch of insufferable self-righteous cunts, and that's coming from me, someone who's far left in his beliefs. That doesn't mean I buy into their style of always being disingenuous bullshitters.

They know damn well the things they condemn, like medicine that obviously has human dosages, aren't what they say they are. They lose any chance of having a real argument/point or changing any minds when they constantly just lie between their teeth.

But they don't care, they just want echo chambers to be seething cunts in.</div>
