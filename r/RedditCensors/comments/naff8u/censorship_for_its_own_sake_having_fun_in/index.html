    <div class="card-body">
      <div class="md">This one really made my blood pressure spike, because it was such an obvious arbitrary power flex. I came across a photo post with the title "[Sherwood Forest, Nottingham](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/n7mzyi/sherwood_forest_nottingham_england/)," which I'm archiving as I post this. Other people pointed out that Sherwood Forest looks nothing like this, after which there was a long line of people saying things along the lines of "no, it's this place in England" or "no, it's that one." The discussion was going nowhere, so I decided to do a reverse image search on the photo, quickly got informative results, and posted them. This is what I wrote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Let's settle this. I took the image, inputted it into [Tineye.com](https://Tineye.com), and pulled up this stock image, over on Getty Images.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/padley-gorge-royalty-free-image/453944949?irgwc=1&amp;esource=AFF\_GI\_IR\_TinEye\_77643&amp;asid=TinEye&amp;cid=GI&amp;utm\_medium=affiliate&amp;utm\_source=TinEye&amp;utm\_content=77643](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/padley-gorge-royalty-free-image/453944949?irgwc=1&amp;esource=AFF_GI_IR_TinEye_77643&amp;asid=TinEye&amp;cid=GI&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=TinEye&amp;utm_content=77643)  
&gt;  
&gt;"Padley Gorge - stock photo  
&gt;  
&gt;Twisted trees, rocks and mosses in Padley Gorge, Derbyshire."  
&gt;  
&gt;On brief examination, this would appear to be that stock image, darkened with with the saturation pushed up. I doubt that this is a matter of photographing the same scene later in the day, which might have been an interesting choice, because the forms in one image match those in the other too well, one photo mapping too well onto another, point by corresponding point. Also, note that exactly the same leaves seem to be turning color. Even if two photographers could have found exactly the same spot to shoot from, and aimed their cameras in exactly the same direction, composing their shots in exactly the same way, colors would change too quickly in early autumn for this match to seem a likely one, I would think. A second photographer would have to arrive to take that shot implausibly quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;This would appear to be derivative image, produced through the use of Photoshop or some similar program, not a true, unaltered photo. I suppose that it might have make a nice wallpaper, though, were it large enough.  
&gt;  
&gt;Duncan Fawkes is listed as the man who took the original photograph.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine my amazement when I looked back, a few minutes ago (and just a few hours after I posted my comment) and discovered that the perfectly reasonable remarks you see quoted above were deleted by one of the mods. Which one? I don't know, but it would have to be one of the three you see on this list.

[https://archive.is/zWtqY](https://archive.is/zWtqY)

Note the complete absence, not only of anything violating the rules of the sub or of Reddit, but of anything that was even remotely controversial. I simply posted a reasoned argument for why I thought that the OP had posted a shopped version of Duncan Fawkes' photo, and almost instantly, it was removed. One can still see it in the most recent capture of my profile in Archive Today

[http://archive.is/HiDr1](http://archive.is/HiDr1)

but for how long will it remain visible, even on my profile? I don't know. What I do know if that I took the time to do a little bit of research to settle a question that people were trying to answer, and that my work went to waste just because somebody was having fun acting like a pr-ck.

There's no other motivation to be found. Who, exactly, would take offense at the mention of Padley Gorge, Derbyshire or Tineye? This is a case of a mod removing something just to f--k with a member of his sub, of a mod abusing his power because he wanted to act like a troll. I've sent a note in to the mods about the incident. I haven't heard back, but I'm not hopeful. I've never seen the mods in a sub on Reddit decide to be helpful when messaged by anybody, even once. My view of this site is getting darker by the minute.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** I just looked at the homepage for the sub, looked at [a pinned post](https://archive.is/FoYCB), and think I know who the censor was and why he censored my comment. This was payback for not absolutely toeing the party line on the lockdowns.

If so, that's certainly not a valid reason to remove a non-Covid related comment.</div>
