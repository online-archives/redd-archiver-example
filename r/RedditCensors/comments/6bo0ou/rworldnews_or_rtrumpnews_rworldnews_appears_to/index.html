    <div class="md">Some of these *could* pass under a generous interpretation of the "no US politics" rule, as they deal with foreign reactions and interactions. Others have absolutely no excuse: how certain candidates are said to be reacting to their potential nomination for FBI Director is a US internal matter; McCain's opinion of Trump is a US internal matter.

However, a charitable interpretation can not be extended, because the /r/worldnews' moderators have a long history of outright breaking their own rules to push an anti-Trump narrative, as [extensively](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/684p7s/rworldnews_headmod_maxwellhill_keeps_breaking_his/?ref=search_posts) [documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/63zjbm/rworldnews_headmod_maxwellhill_continues_to_break/?ref=search_posts) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/6asms6/rworldnews_headmod_maxwellhill_keeps_breaking_his/?ref=search_posts).

Aside from their many biases, such as their [extensive censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/search?q=%2Fr%2Fworldnews&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), the /r/worldnews moderators seem to be actively engaged in a massive active ideological campaign through selective application of their rules.</div>

    <div class="md">I find this shit incredibly scary. Not only are we being expected to just shut down our brains and believe anything we read based on 'anonymous sources,' but even if these sources *are* real the implications are alarming. The intelligence community is systematically leaking classified information to the press *in order to deliberately influence, create, and guide* news narratives.

 'Unnamed sources' in the IC, through compliant journalists, are dominating the media. The MSM has willingly given over the reigns of the press to people who just a few years ago the Left were decrying as pseudo-fascist, and the intelligence community is perfectly willing to dangerously destabilise the country they're pledged to protect because of a political outcome they found disagreeable. This should frighten anyone; the fact that so many are cheering it on gives an indication of how little genuine regard there is for democracy in the US anymore. </div>
