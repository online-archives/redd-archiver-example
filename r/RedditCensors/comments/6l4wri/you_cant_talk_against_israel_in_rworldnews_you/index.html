    <div class="md">Check out http://ifamericaknew.org/, lots of illuminating information there for anyone who is not familiar with the conflict.

The conflict is far more one-sided than most US media reports with far more transgressions from Israel.

A UN report is available here:

[UN Report - Israeli Practices towards the Palestinian People and the Question of Apartheid](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4dBqK3Z51-BeHJVRXVoSWRfZHc)

This is a small list of events from the most recent conflicts.

To give you an idea of the utter destruction going on in Gaza, here's a video of an area of the city being flattened by airstrikes. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c77_1406577312

This list is far from complete, there are thousands of videos like this, some even worse.

As you can see, the "war" is far more one sided than the media will let you know.

If you live in the U.S., call your state representatives and urge them to stop sending billions in support to Israel every year.</div>
