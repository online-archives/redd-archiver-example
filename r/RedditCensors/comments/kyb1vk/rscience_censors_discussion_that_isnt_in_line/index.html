Inb4 someone argues against the content of my comment itself: A) you are indeed an idiot, however B) that's besides the point. The point is that reasonable discussion is being censored on a sub that claims to be scientific. When you're enforcing a political agenda, however, you're no longer scientific. You're propagandist. 

This is the main science subreddit of reddit, and if this is occurring by the mods now (it was already occurring via brigading vote manipulation), I think that's the final nail in the coffin for reddit having any credibility of a site that values free discussion. Reddit is fascist website enjoying 230 protections while enforcing a personal authoritarian narrative.</div>

    <div class="md">there was an AskScience AMA like two days ago on the subject of vaccine hesitancy, meaning to clear up misconceptions and advocate for taking the COVID vaccines. I tried to ask a really basic question about whether my vaccination affects other people or not, since it's still possible to transmit infection even after being vaccinated. [Three separate attempts from three different accounts](https://imgur.com/a/Nl6b3yv) and each time my question was silently deleted shortly after I posted it. I even received a reply back from the mod team after I asked them about it. [The reply failed to acknowledge the posts and didn't even make any sense.](https://imgur.com/FVRti97)</div>

    <div class="md">your answer does not pertain to my question. I'm not talking about a weak version of the virus. I'm talking about, if you are vaccinated, and then you become infected with COVID afterward due to your exposure to the virus elsewhere, you can still transmit full-scale COVID infection to another person, even if you yourself experience reduced symptoms due to your vaccination.</div>

    <div class="md">You can be exposed and not infected as a result of being vaccinated.

You can also be exposed and infected for a much shorter period of time, reducing the risk of transmission.

A virus has to take hold in a body for a period of time before it gets to the point where it can be transmitted.  Vaccines reduce both rate of infection and transmission.

I guess we’re discussing semantics.  I define infectious as being able to transmit effectively.  If your body knows what to look for and contains a virus before it can effectively be transmitted then you’re not infected.</div>

    <div class="md">yeah, when I'm using the term "infection", I'm only referring very simply to the virus being in your body. That is, as long as it's in there and your body hasn't successfully fought it off, you're infected. By this definition, there is no vaccine that prevents infection. This is what I meant. You're right that vaccines reduce the timespan and the severity of infection, though, thus reducing the transmissibility. I acknowledge this.</div>

    <div class="md">I hate the from versus of debate because it's stupid.

It's a macro versus micro thing. A good analogy is smoking.

We know smoking causes cancer but in an individual case, there's no way of knowing if a particular cancer diagnosis was from smoking or not. Or why smoking doesn't lead to cancer in some people.

We can know there is a massive impact from the pandemic without having to worry about individual cases.

But there has also been basically no talk about QALY with this pandemic. Is it just to lock elderly people in a nursing home with no social contact for a year to extend life a few more years?

I honestly have no idea. But they are very legitimate questions that get completely lost in the stupid discourse about masks and shit. And yes, mask wearing should be universal. Shaming people for outdoor gatherings is dumb.

I think I've managed to have a view that pisses off everyone at this point so I'll leave it at that.</div>

Nah, you don't get to force people to wear something they don't want to on their own property. Public property is debatable. I can cite you ~20 charts of cases spiking after mask mandates.</div>

    <div class="md">They mandated it for hospitality workers and gyms. The former doing light cardio for 10 hours a day. The latter doing intense workouts. Retail workers, although not necessarily walking around all day like hospitality workers, are still wearing it for prolonged periods of time. This shortlist isn't exhaustive; use your imagination.

I think there are cons to mask use that vary with how long it's worn for. Think about it. There's a pocket of CO2 left inside the mask with each exhale, which is then inhaled in the next breath. Your quality of air is compromised. 

Each individual should calculate the risk/reward and decide for themselves.</div>

    <div class="md">You also exhale oxygen. So there’s a pocket of oxygen in your mask.

The amount of co2 to “compromise” your ability to breath would be considerable, and the masks aren’t tight enough for it. I can’t even understand how you would think it’s a problem.</div>
