r whitepeopletwitter (racist name btw)

all the news ones including:

r worldnews (I was instantly permabanned because I said I don't believe any country should be able to kill an unlimited number of civilians in the name of self defense/that we need to draw the line somewhere)

r news

r politics

all the regional ones including

r europe (I got instantly permabanned because on a highly upvoted post of an anti-far right march I said yelling in the face of the far right and calling them names is not going to make them say you are right I was completely wrong I now believe you, rather, hatred begets hatred, as history including the past 10 years factually shows, the more radical  the left gets, the more the far right movement has grown, and that if we want to decrease hate and hateful movements we need to increase critical thinking and freedom of speech across society).  

r canada (any meaningful criticism of the left-wing government is an insta permaban)

and most provincial/state/city subs

all the so called scientific ones including 

r science (I got insta permabanned because I replied to a black person and agreed to what he said: he said virtue signalling was not helpful, and I went into more depth in terms of why: I said the reason for modern racism is because of lack of knowledge of statistics and critical thinking: for example, people not knowing the concept of correlation vs causation, they tend to miss things like a minority group likely has higher rates of crime because of the variable poverty, and not skin colour, and so if we want to decrease racism we need to increase science and critical thinking instead of yelling at each other and calling each other racists).  

and all the covid related ones 

r hermancainaward (a subreddit that celebrated/celebrates the death of humans who do not 100% agree with the mainstream ideology, endorsed by reddit)

r witchesgainstpatriarchy (this and the bottom one are there to promote gender wars, confuse young people, attack the family unit, it reads as if a few unwell BPD-psychotic women gathered together and have a meeting place for their hate filled delusions)

r twoxchromosomes

and pretty much all the so called neutral ones like r pics r damnthatsinteresting, etc.. that make the front page. They state no politics allowed, but frequently the top voted posts/pics and comments are political, yet the second you stray even 1% from the hivemind you get insta-permabanned.

&#x200B;

**Basically, you spot a pattern. Reddit is a psy-op, all the mainstream subs are there to create hate and division, so people remain divided and continue to worship certain politicians, instead of coming together and uniting against the collective cause of their issues: the politicians who are trying to divide and conquer them and exploit their labour for their yacht-accumulating buddies. That is why anybody who meaningfully criticizes politicians, or wants to create meaningful change or increase scientific and critical thinking is instantly permabanned.**

To maintain an illusion of democracy and freedom of speech, reddit allows fringe subs, such as this one,  to operate largely uncensored. But the only reason they do this is because these subs get very little traffic: they do not influence public thinking. It is the main subs that influence 100s of millions of people across the world. As history factually shows, any time a fringe sub begins to gain ground and get a lot of members/readers, it is immediately 1984d. Just one example is r scienceuncensored. It reached 100k members and no new posts since 4 months ago. It was obviously culled from above. </div>
