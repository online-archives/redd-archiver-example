&gt;Just a quick reminder to everyone who, like me, is anti-censorship:

&gt;You can always reverse the censorship of any comment thread by grabbing the URL for the comment thread and replacing the "r" in reddit.com to a "c". Then just wait for the thread to process and you'll be able to make your own decisions about what you want to see.

After the comment was censored, I inquired as to the reason:

Reply from the mods and being muted.

It's clear they are not interested in following their rules, but instead enforcing their own beliefs and censoring away ideas that they disagree with. What's incredible is they're willing to censor away comments that simply allow others to, outside of their subreddit, see the comments that were censored away.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh I get why they removed it and why they were annoyed, but either make a rule that says "When we censor something, you are not allowed to post instructions for others to view the uncensored version" or admit that there is no rule and they just removed it because they want to steer to conversation to their own view.

I broke no rule, and they know it. </div>
