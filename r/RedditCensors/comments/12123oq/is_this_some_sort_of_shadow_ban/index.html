    <div class="md">I had no idea this mechanism was in place. So someone on a thread can post whatever they want, and the by blocking someone, the other person is effectively censored from being able to respond to anything, while everyone else can control the information and narrative?

    <div class="md">Yep. This only applies to threads they are the leader of, though. So if i were to block you then you'd still be able to reply to NuderWorldOrder above this sub-thread. If you were to block me i would not be able to reply to anyone in this post since you're OP.

If a third party responds to me, or Nuder responds to this comment, you'd be able to see their response, but not mine, and you would not be able to respond to them or vote. Occasionally it shows that you can vote but i don't think it works.</div>

    <div class="md">Wow…. That is such an obvious tool for absolute censorship of discussion.

The thread I was posting on was pretty obviously done to push an agenda.

Many people committed and the op went down the responses going after people in the comments.

I responded to one of his comment threads and part way trying to respond I suddenly was not able to respond.

I noticed the top comment of the thread had been deleted by moderators, as well as the specific comment I had responded to, so I thought that was the reason.’

Later I kept getting notifications that others were responding to my comments, but I could still not reply.

The next day the post was removed by the mods for breaking the sub rules and being in the wrong sub.
(Of course at that point nobody could respond).</div>

Are you sure it was removed? That says something like *removed by moderator*. If it says [deleted] and the username is also [deleted] that means you were blocked. That's what shows up instead of a comment when someone blocks you.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, at first the overall post remained, but the thread I was responding to said [deleted] and the username was deleted.

Other were able to keep responding, but I could respond there or anywhere else on the overall post.

I also couldn’t do a top level response to the initial post.

I got notifications that others were responding to my comments on the thread, but I could not respond.

The next day mods removed the whole post.</div>
