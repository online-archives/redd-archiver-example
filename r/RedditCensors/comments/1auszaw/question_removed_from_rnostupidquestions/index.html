    <div class="md">They already did: it was the "Summer of Love 2020"

Theirs did way more damage, because it was people's businesses that were destroyed in the grand tantrum of 2020. They're actually extremely lucky that none of them were shot and killed for acting out, but that's probably because they just so happened to avoid states with strong self defense laws 🤔🧐</div>

    <div class="md">Or it'll straighten the political landscape of America and get the politicians actually listening and working for the people. Hopefully they would get the picture before they let it get to that point. 

Again, I'm not taking either political party's side on this one. I'm just tired of politicians running this country to the ground while they have billionaires dicks up their asses during the whole process.</div>

    <div class="md">Here since it was removed there I will answer. Even though I’m a big supporter of Biden, I still think it should be illegal to start an insurrection like Trump did and whoever started it shall be punished. Apparently Trump is good at running from consequences because he’s been a con for his whole life.</div>

    <div class="md">Thank you, and before it was removed, I did get a decent amount of replies with answers similar to your own, which are excellent ways to have civil conversation even though short form social media barely passes as any form of real conversation. 

I also agree with your answer. Although I am not in support of biden, I think anyone who commits a crime should be held accountable. Having said that, I don't think I will ever be given enough accurate information to form a definitive definition of what exactly happened and who specifically I think should be accountable. I hold that true not just to Jan 6th but to the majority of the topics in the 24-hour news cycle.</div>

    <div class="md">No. One unarmed woman was killed that day. 5 people did not die that day. They didn't storm in, the Capitol police let them in. You can review the footage yourself. Did some get unruly? Sure. Doesn't qualify as an insurrection.</div>

    <div class="md">I can cherry pick video of protesters being unruly as well i.e when they flooded the Capitol building last year promoting a ceasefire in Gaza. Doesn't make it an insurrection. Take you emotions out of it.

Did you even read the link you supplied? It literally states what you said is inaccurate about 5 people dying that day. One person was actually murdered by a police officer.</div>

    <div class="md">It's not a "sensitive area". What makes it more sensitive than other areas of the building? He shot an unarmed woman. If they weren't being political about it he would have been fired and held up on charges. The same as they do for police officers in every other setting.</div>
