    <div class="md">The FBI/DOJ Uniform Crime Victimization Survey

There are some fantastic findings. Blacks rape over 3000 times as many non blacks as the reverse. Blacks actually commit more crime against Asians than Asians commit against other Asians. It’s amazing stuff.

    <div class="md">If you're talking about [The National Crime Victimization Survey](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf) then you just made that shit up. Table 12 shows that black people commit 21.7% of violent crime. This is not where the 13/52 joke comes from. Also your claim about rape is not supported here either.

If you're talking about the [Uniform Crime Reporting](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/102263/version/V7/view) program, their data comes from arrests and police encounters. Nothing to do with victims.</div>

    <div class="md">Your criminally low IQ is showing.

Your assertion of one allegation in one district of one city somehow disproving blacks committing a horrifyingly disproportionate amount of crime wherever they infect all over the world is hilariously stupid.

Good effort though I know you’re doing the best with what you’ve got 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🐵🤜🏿🤛🏻👱🏻‍♂️👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah thats just an isolated incident, but the jews are behind everything lol.

Anyways, the ol' IQ argument.

In regards to, Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study, the ONLY study with a longitudinal follow up:

"In both waves the wholly White adoptees had a higher mean IQ than the Black–White adoptees, and the Black–White adoptees had a higher mean IQ than the Black–Black adoptees, in line with the hereditarian model. Moreover, those IQ gaps widened between the study’s two waves, consistent with genes exerting greater power as the adoptees aged." 

However...

"A total of 25 White adoptees were in the study when it began, nine of whom were lost at follow-up. The lost adoptees had relatively low IQs, so the remaining White adoptees were unrepresentatively high in IQ, as Mackintosh observed [25]. One can prove this by comparing the original IQs of the full sample and the subgroup who were measured at both ages 7 and 17; the latter subgroup had an initial mean IQ of 117.6 (with a minimum IQ of 92) but the full sample had an initial mean of 111.5 (minimum 62). Because initial and final IQs had a correlation of 0.63 among the White group, the elite subgroup would likely have had their final mean IQ inflated by about 0.63 × (117.6 − 111.5) = 3.8 points. Meanwhile, the BW and Black–Black adoptees lost to follow-up hardly differed in IQ from the remaining adoptees, so attrition inflated those groups’ mean IQs by about only 0.2 and −0.7 points respectively.

Adjusting the final mean IQs accordingly (Table 2) implies smaller racial differences of 3.5 points (White vs. BW adoptees) and 11.7 points (White vs. Black–Black adoptees) in the study’s final wave. The former is only 1 point wider than the corresponding initial difference, and the latter is 3 points narrower. Hence, allowing for attrition, the IQ differences between the White and the Black adoptees were no larger at age 17 than at age 7, a sign that the apparent enlarging was an artifact and not a genetic effect."

Whites were also adopted almost year earlier than the blacks or asians in this study which has been documented to negatively effect IQ.

Furthermore,

"The other studies of Black adoptees [15,16] do not fit the hereditarian model nearly as well, as the race-IQ correlations they found were all either small or associated higher IQ with greater Black ancestry."

"there are two more oft-cited Black adoptee studies. One is Tizard [15], a one-page report spun off from a language-acquisition study. In that study 64 4½-year-olds took the Wechsler Pre-school and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) IQ test, of whom 24 “had been adopted into white families at a mean age of 3.1 yr” (p. 316). A total of 17 adoptees were White and had a mean IQ of 113.0, and seven were BW and had a mean IQ of 119.9. The superior IQ of the adoptees with more Black ancestry reverses the main result of Scarr and Weinberg. In Scarr and Weinberg [13], the BW adoptees lagged the White adoptees by 2.5 ± 3.5 points, while in Tizard [15], the BW adoptees outscored the White adoptees by 6.9 ± 6.6 points.

The other study is Moore’s [16], which assessed 23 Black–Black and BW adoptees, raised in White families, on the WISC. Like Tizard [15] and unlike Scarr and Weinberg [13], the adoptees with more Black ancestry had higher IQs: nine fully Black adoptees had a mean IQ of 118.0 and 14 BW adoptees had a mean IQ of 116.5. The resulting IQ difference is 1.5 ± 4.1 points, where the standard error is approximate because the standard deviations involved are pooled estimates."

    <div class="md">Wow lol, another dumb alt right red herring "No. Very few places/peoples on earth actually "invented" the wheel. /u/Daeres , one of the mods, has a lengthy post on it http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bgqyf/carts_cereals_and_ceramics/.
But here is the section on the wheel specifically
&gt; One is a specific one to our particular protagonist, who asserts that the wheel is a basic technology. I will have to be generous here and assume that they don’t mean wheel shaped objects, but something that is used in combination with other things as an actual method of assisted locomotion (wheels can move without assistance, but surprisingly rarely is this accomplishing much that’s useful). To my knowledge, the use of wheels for transport has been developed at best twice, and quite probably just once; the certain candidate for now appears to be a relatively small part of western Central Asia, and the possible other candidate is part of Central Europe, but the appearance of the wheel in both areas is so contemporary that’s possible that it represents one phenomena, or that one predates the other. This is a technology that then had to spread throughout the entirety of continental Eurasia, and much of Africa. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians Hittites, and Mycenaeans did not invent chariots. The Chinese did not invent chariots. The ancient Britons did not invent chariots. The Romans did not invent chariots. The ancient peoples of India did not invent chariots. Every single one of these famously complex societies was reliant on the invention developed in one part of the world. None of these people were ‘smart enough’ to sit down by themselves and realise that wheels can work when going across flat areas. Does this make the ancient Babylonians stupid? Does this make the precursors to the ancient Greeks stupid? Does this make China’s ancient cultures and societies stupid? The use of wheeled transport does not, it seems to my non-engineer brain, seem to be an intuitive piece of reasoning whatsoever. In addition, if Subsaharan Africa (in any of the three earlier definitions) is full of ridiculously large flat areas, somebody maybe ought to tell the enormous, malaria-infested rainforests that dominate Central Africa so that they can find new gainful employment. Or the mountains that rear from the earth like a great crocodile under most of East Africa, right up to the earlier mentioned home territory of D’mt and Aksum. Oh, certainly there were flat bits in Africa, but by asking them to independently develop the wheel you are setting them a task that only at best two places in the entire world have matched, and we don’t even know the names of the people/s that achieved this feat. I don’t think the wheel as a mode of transport looks so simple as our protagonist suggested."</div>

    <div class="md">Lol I actually never did that, thats just your inability to percieve nuance and poor reading comprehension. Im not surprised though, because your entire position is predicated on a lack of understanding and perversions of truth.

Edit: Not a single point where I used the phrase "ancestors culture".

Edit: do you guys have a script where you have to use the phrase "low IQ" in every other comment?</div>
