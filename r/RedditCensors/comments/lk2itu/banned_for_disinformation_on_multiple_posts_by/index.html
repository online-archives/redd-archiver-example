Facts and opinions (based in reality) which they don't like, are considered "disinformation" apparently. I wonder if admins give a shit about censorship and mod abuse. I see plenty of misinformation and lies get upvoted in places like politics, politicalhumor and presidentialracememes. They do nothing about that, why? The post I made joked about how Democrats act like they are powerless, even when they have power. Yeah, they they don't have the supreme court (partly thanks to Pelosi, Schumer and Ginsburg), but they still have the house, senate and executive.</div>

    <div class="md">They banned me for "disinformation" too, but I'm pretty sure it's just a blanket ban excuse. I've noticed other left-leaning regular users missing around the same time, so it seems like they're going mask off and just banning left-leaning people from their sub, while rule-breaking neoliberals have been given a free pass.

Although I did criticize neoliberals before I got banned twice in the past month, so maybe the mods are delusional enough to actually be neoliberals. It would explain a lot.</div>
