## Summary

I've found evidence for 5 submission bots on r/MarchAgainstTrump. These accounts are responsible for over 4800 posts or 39.5% of all submissions to the sub. Most or all of these are controlled by a moderator.

1. Wondermonkeydans - Moderator and bot master.
2. theIastjedi 
3. cereal-reposta 
4. Micro_West
5. thisisnatyocheese 


[This chart](https://imgur.com/RwKypZC) shows total daily submissions and submissions from those accounts.

***

## What are bots?

"Bot" refers to an account using some type of automation to post, vote, comment, etc. I'm sure most people have seen u/AutoModerator before.

These accounts are like regular Reddit accounts. Real people can sign in and use it like any other account. In this case though, a program is signing in to submit posts.

***
## How do submission bots work?

Here's a few examples:

1. They search places like Google/Bing news and post the top results.
2. They follow the RSS feeds from sites like The Washington Post and post new articles as they come in.
3. Reposting from other users on Reddit, like copying from r/EnoughTrumpSpam and r/PoliticalHumor.

***

## How do you identify a submission bot?

I look for several things, but the most obvious sign of bot usage is how often they post. Spammers and karma whores might submit a lot of links, but if they're human, there's generally a gap between posts, and they don't post around the clock.

***
# The Evidence

I analyzed 12,244 submissions from r/MarchAgainstTrump from 2017-01-28 to 2017-05-07

These are the top 15 accounts with the most submissions:

Following, is some of evidence and a break down for each of the 5 accounts I've identified as using bots to submit.

***
# Wondermonkeydans:

Current moderator and top submitter for the sub with far more submissions than any other account. Most of these submissions have since been deleted.

* Unlike the other bots, this is their personal account, and they also use it like a normal user would.

* From March 4, to May 2, they made over 2100 submissions to MarchAgainstTrump. Averaging over 35 submissions a day. 

* Most of these are concentrated between March 14 and April 27.

[Chart of daily submissions and wondermonkeydans submissions in MarchAgainstTrump](http://imgur.com/vUy9LrQ)

Here is one of many instances, where they made submissions faster than what's possible without a program.

9 submissions over 4 seconds (including 4 in 1 second):

### Micro_West

* 478 submissions, all to MarchAgainstTrump
* 1 comment ever, in r/LifeProTips (now deleted)
* Began posting The day Wondermonkeydans stopped: 2017-04-27

In fact;

* Wondermonkeydans last post on that day was at 16:14:21
* Micro_West first post was at 16:44:11

[This chart illustrates that](http://imgur.com/k6jxpWD). Notice how similar their post activity is.

Micro_West averaged over 50 submissions a day until a few days ago. 

Shortly after I [presented this evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/69fzzi/manipulation_automation_and_shenanigans_are/dh7wh6i/) to MarchAgainstTrump moderater u/luck_panda, Micro_West stopped posting and began deleting all their posts. 

Here's [an archive of their user page](https://archive.fo/V2LlY) made about 35 minutes after I made that post. 


Here they are making 4 submissions in 1 second (one of many examples):

* 2017-05-04 19:59:17 - MarchAgainstTrump (Micro_West): ["'I'm President! Can you believe it?' Trump gets excited after AHCA passes House"](https://www.reddit.com/comments/699xn0)

## Former moderator bcfc1003 confirms wondermonkeydans is botting. 

&gt; I'm a former mod of the sub and I can confirm that there's all sorts of upvoting and posting bots going on. Some of the mods have posting bots (I think there's 3 or 4, not too sure on that one) and there's upvote bots as well.

#
&gt;Not written it down but I've seen it in a discord chat before. **They are wondermonkeydans and cereal-reposta**. There's another one but I can't remember the name. If you look at their posting patterns you'll see. Their top mod admitted they're using bots as well.
Guess all I can say is watch their patterns. They spam posts back to back.

[(archive)](https://archive.fo/qiYfO)

They also made this comment and deleted it before the archive got it:

    <div class="md">Reddit would give a shit if the bot were posting stuff outside of their narrative. But within the narrative, it's ok. Possible reddit even supplied the code for the bots.

    <div class="md">One of the problems with allowing things like this is the other side will eventually learn these same tactics.  In essence they created an arms race.  So we're currently heading in a direction where both sides will start heavily botting each other.  That will destroy what little integrity this site has, open up opportunities for other sites to scoop up reddit's disenfranchised members and sour the milk for potential advertisers.  

I mean the moment information like this goes public and reddit gets accused of mass botting to boost their figures... advertisers will start steering clear of the site the same way they ran from youtube.  

So the problem really should be addressed unless reddit wants to become the next MySpace.  </div>

    <div class="md">I'm sure you can ban people, but they can come right back and bot some more.  I mean anyone dedicated to shitposting with a bot could flood multiple areas all at once and more or less pollute the social environment till it becomes toxic.  The mods would be constantly burning out trying to prevent it.  Which would sour the reddit milk so to say.  The_Donald recruits new temp mods every month because they are constantly under attack.  So other subs would have to do the same.    

Another scenario is... you get rid of all the conservative views, but then the SJWs will just go on witch hunts either suspecting conservatives are hiding among them or lashing out at one another for not having the exact same opinion.  We've all seen them eat their own and that will also lead to an eventual death.    

It appears these people with their agenda have diversity in everything except diversity of thought.  This website looks more like tumblr everyday.  </div>

    <div class="md">Reddit deserves to die by the time this occurs. Its clearly morphed into yet another tool of the mega corps which is the exact opposite ideology it was founded on. 

Reddit had become Facebook 2.0 and its only a matter of time before the real reddit loyalists migrate to another open market platform. 

The only question is whether any loyalists are still around or if reddit has become so faecbookized that it's simply too late to get those same people back. 

My bet is that most have gone back to /pol/ and that the reddit experience which was once so great, has reached its inevitable conclusion: mainstream blah. </div>

https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/587h8f/rthe_donald_claims_its_not_botting_but_has_over/?st=J2MCAFUY&amp;sh=c2e518f4

Then I realized the top comment is right, they're not botting in the script sense, they're just mindlessly upvoting without looking at the content. 

I got another post about r/marchagainsttrump botting mixed up with TD botting because I'm acomplete idiot who scrolls through the front page too quickly.</div>

    <div class="md">Look.  The OP is correct in that these are obviously bots.  I verified myself that one of them posted 3 articles in 2 seconds.

See?  I'm already different from t_d.  I'm willing to research and agree with facts that don't favor my political ideology.

"The other side will eventually learn"

You act like both sides haven't been doing this for the entire campaign.  It's obvious propaganda and bullshit.  Both Hillary and Trump have had shills here since at least the start of t_d.  In addition, somehow Trump has managed to turn 4chan into his personal army, which is not something most people familiar with 4chan would have expected.

The difference is Hillary's shills and liberal supporters tend to be based on facts.  t_d posters start with glaring projection and flat out lying.

Not that I'm in favor of shills on either side.</div>

    <div class="md">Everyone knows CTR went waaaay beyond *correcting the record*.  I think CTR/DNC tactics were the catalyst that turned this election into a shit show.  That and our fake-fucking news that isn't doing their job.  They are screwing over the American people by allowing rigged debates and interviews, and becoming propaganda machines.  If nothing else, there is clear push-back due to this propaganda.  It's harming truth and trust.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; One of the problems with allowing things like this is the other side will eventually learn these same tactics.

Yep. Remember when all the SJWs/mods/etc were clamoring for more censorship power? They were so happy when mods got power to censor. Then the_donald showed up and started using SJW tactics of censorship and these SJWs got banned from the_donald and they started whining and crying and creating shitty subs like bannedfromthe_donald.

If politics and these idiot SJWs didn't support censorship so much, the_donald wouldn't exist in the first place and even if they did, the culture of censorship wouldn't exist and the mods on the_donald wouldn't have been able to get away with banning everyone they disagreed with.

    <div class="md">This is so true.  

I've noticed liberals in general don't tend to think ahead before making decisions.  Like when they destroyed part of the filibuster system thinking that Hillary would be the next president only to have conservatives take over everything and use their weapons against them.

It kinda like dating a girl who cheated on her boyfriend to be with you.  If she'll do it with you then she'll do it to you.  So it's better to play fair or fuck whores without emotional attachment.  </div>

    <div class="md">Exactly!

It happens to liberals all the time.  They join the group because they want to part of some cause they believe is noble.  Then the group narrative changes, they don't agree with the new narrative and find themselves being labeled the enemy.  The tools they once thought were fair to use are now used against them and they realize (all too late) that it's wrong.  

It's "good intentions" instead of good actions that lead people to ruin.  </div>

    <div class="md">Since I'm not sure about the risk of specifically linking TD, you can find the citation for the below data by searching TD for  "over 6,000,000 subscribers"

TD is at a minimum competitive with politics for advertiser-generating site share. Closing TD would lead to a temporary surge as it would be relatively big internet news, but the temporary gain would not be commensurate in the long-term loss from losing TD. This might be the only true impact of its closure, but it can be said to be objectively derived. If reddit closes an area that they sell advertisements for, they can no longer make money from it. 

Thanks to repeated blog posts, the reddit administrators as good as explicitly described the methods they would use to prevent TD from being able to reach the front page, and the several occasions of clear administrative-level voting system changes to affect TD are well chronicled, the most infamous being Trump's automatically-set-to-zero presidential portrait. There is not a confession, but the results are sufficient evidence of deliberate intervention. This post provides further evidence to that point. 

Finally, reddit is likely fearful of consequences that would come from closing TD. I think reddit would recover quickly enough, but the quite appropriate fear would be that its closure would lead to a power vacuum. Certain subreddits would be trolled to inoperable states. Administrators and moderators would be doxxed and targeted with harassment. The site would probably be hit with black hat attacks, making dealing with all the trolling even more difficult, people like Chuck Johnson/Pax Dickinson &amp; Mike Cernovich would likely assist in lawsuits being brought against reddit, which while ultimately fruitless would cost the site more to deal with than the plaintiffs. It could also be a boon for competition, and if one site took hold fast enough that alone could kill reddit.

That's their fear. I don't think it would happen, but you can understand why they would be trepidatious about the risk. </div>

Reddit banning the site where POTUS did his AMA would be a public relations nightmare. 

Bad for business.

So the admins simply try to bury it, again and again, with shady software "updates",

while allowing / encouraging actually abusive subs to run amok.

    <div class="md">- It's there but reddit changed rules at least two times already to keep it off the front page. You'd think that t_d consistently reaching top means a good part of reddit agrees with it (democracy and all) but since reddit admins are severely anti-T, they cannot tolerate it.
- A previously paid feature - subreddit filtering - was made available for free specifically due to t_d.
- Something's fucky going on with subscriber counts as shown by the advertiser page. Numbers to advertisers are shown bigger than to subscribers. Even if it's just a global bug or something, t_d's number disparity is the biggest – 400k versus 6 million.
- Also, t_d is kept off r/popular but anti-T subs aren't.

All in all, reddit *would like* to remove t_d (there even were discord screenshots confirming it), but t_d got too big to fail. Reddit would need for t_d to somehow fuck up, bigly. That, or to plant "evidence" themselves. Knowing that Spez was editing people's comments willy nilly, anything's possible. While trying to label Pepe as a "hate symbol" is not reddit's work, it's one of the ways to do it. Remove t_d because it posts "racist" symbol, for example.</div>

It won't show on popular, the admins have tweaked the algorithm many times to keep it off of /r/all front page, they completely weigh the votes differently as well. 

They don't ban it because it is one of if not the most active sub here and they want that ad money and to keep 400,000 (at a minimum) angry people off other subs.</div>

Do you really think it's about the narrative or about what drives revenue and what doesn't. 

For example, if it went against the narrative but brought lots of advertisers, do you think Reddit would allow it? </div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Possible reddit even supplied the code for the bots.

With a basic understanding of the reddit bot community (if you want to call it that), you'll see that there is already code out there for stuff like this. Just need a few modifications to make it work the way you want it to.

Possible? Technically. Plausible? No way. Can you imagine the PR disaster that would ensue if that were to get out? In the end, reddit, inc. cares about reddit, inc. first. There's no tangible reason to believe that reddit, inc. is involved with this.</div>

I have no idea because I don't post in T_D but I can imagine, I used to see the post on frontpage every day and now they're always showing up first thing on the second page.
&gt;there also must be some kind of algorithm to keep the number of subs below 400k.

That hasn't do much with actual bots and more reddit algorithms but good luck proving that one.</div>

This is not irrefutable evidence, it's a good indicator there's something fishy going on but that's about it.

Then look at the numbers on r\esist, r\MarchAgainstTrump, or any of the other dozens of anti-Trump shill reddits. There will be dozens of posts with &lt;100 upvotes and one with 20K+ that's on the front page. That's what a few shills in control of a giant upvote botnet looks like.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm looking at the front page of The_Donald right now. 2K to 14K upvotes per post, 23 to 801 comments per article. 400K subscribers and 3,350 online.

I'm looking at the front page of MarchAgainstTrump now. 10 (yes, ten) to 285 upvotes per post, zero to 58 comments, **except for two posts with 20K and 26K upvotes, both of which made r\all.** 53K subscribers, 1,300 online. 

Now, the front page of r\esist. 7 (yes, seven) to 274 upvotes per post, **except for two posts with 30K upvotes each, both of which made r\all.** 83K subscribers, 236 online.

r\esist is even more blatant than MAT. A sub with literally 7% of the active users and an average upvote count in the dozens can vault two articles to all with an upvote count *unachievable by a sub with 14 times the active users*?</div>

    <div class="md">I don't know about that.  I think they are just using different tactics to different ends.  MAT bots seem to be for the sake of karma-whoring.  That's the only benefit to submitting articles en masse and not using the same bots to upvote every single post.   t_D has been dedicated to pushing all other content off the front page.  There were times when every single front page post in All was a t_D post.  Pretty obvious bullshittery IMO.

    <div class="md">The reason the front page was all T_D, *which was only for a few hours one day,* was when Reddit changed "the algorithm" to keep T_D articles off the front page but screwed up the code and made EVERY front page article from T_D instead. They "fixed" it in a few hours so that it had its intended effect of censoring T_D.

T_D has been artificially banned from r\all for months, and r\popular was created specifically to keep it off the front page. Upvote botting wouldn't do anything even if it did happen.

Think about it. T_D is the biggest non-default sub and the most active sub. Is it really a surprise that it would thus dominate r\all organically unless they deliberately censored it, which the admins admit to having done on multiple occasions?</div>

    <div class="md">Not comparatively. Spez already got caught hiding the TD numbers, and MAT got caught being an almost entirely bot populated sub. I mean shit, trump won dude. We don't need bots. We had the votes.

More importantly though, "they did it too" isn't actually an argument. We're adults. I shouldn't have to tell you that two wrongs don't make a right. Supposing even in the wildest fantasy that TD is a bot sub, which it isn't, that doesn't make MAT legit. If you want to complain about TDs bots, scrape the sub, find whatever evidence you can and make a thread about it.

This thread, however, is about MAT being almost entirely fake</div>

    <div class="md">bro i audit governments and work hard as fuck.  im working a shit job so i can learn how governments operate in the hopes of getting into politics. assuming i support bernie is dumb as fuck. hes a senile old fool.

i fucking love trump too. saw him at a florida rally a few months ago.

i disagree with supporters on both sides at this point. everyone has an opinion and they always overstate it. i dont need that shit. i appreciate hannity rush and tucker and that is about it. everyone else talks out their ass. 

they memed yea. but the 50 million people in the rural parts of america give 0 fucks about that. silent majority did more than memes. adults were the bulk of the vote. the youngsters getting involved just was the deciding swing to trumps favor. 

its similar to obama using fb to win. yea it helped a bunch but wasnt as significant as you give it credit imo.

when i say the war isnt over, i mean every shitlib talking point is being refuted. argued for days. thats a waste of time and man hours. people take shortcuts and try to use bots and push stuff to refute it, they think they need to go to the enemy level to win. i believe its better to ignore it and move on. ignore the noise, focus on the goals. we dont have the time or resources to waste on arguing with idiots who cannot be convinced they are wrong.

we only have 4 years dude unless good starts happening. get the tax reform out asap and make healthcare agreeable for more people. thats a good start. the economy will boom if he can nail those 2 things. worry about nothing else until you are good on those imo.</div>

    <div class="md">My point was more along the lines of that the GOP definitely has equally-sketchy shit going on, and pretending that the DNC is fucked up but the GOP isn't is nothing less than a smear job. I don't defend how the DNC operates, but I also don't pretend like the Republicans are any different in the dark.

You're not one bit concerned with transparency, truth, or accountability. You just want to *win* out of sheer partisanship, and are completely willing to apply a double standard if it suits your needs.</div>

    <div class="md">To address your first point, yeah definitely. You'd be a fool to claim any political group ever doesn't do sketchy shit. I meant more how reddit/GOP was doing more typical dirt digging while the media/DNC was doing some wayyyy sketchy shit like slanting news and straight up rigging the election against Bernie (not that I like the dude but doesn't matter). 

As to your second point I mean yes, to an extent. I want to win of course. And unlike most people here, I'll admit I'm okay with taking a few shortcuts if the net benefit to America is positive. The thing is, I really do believe Trump will drain the swamp. But part of draining the swamp is transparency, which is something I missed since I didn't get it after our last president immediately sealed his records after taking office.</div>

    <div class="md">You were *literally* just saying how you "meme'd your way to the White House." Now you're telling me "Reddit is too liberal, we would never operate here." So which is it? It can't be both. Or are you too mired in the doublethink to realize the inherent contradiction there?

Thing is, Reddit isn't actually that liberal, on the whole. I say this as a registered Republican. It may lean left, but it's far from a monolithic community; it has pockets of pretty much anything you want, if you know where to look. If there's a liberal lean in the user base overall, it's because the users are generally young, and young people are generally more liberal.

And yet somehow, in this "liberal" site, it's nearly impossible to get a word out without some Trump-stumper jumping into the thread with vitriol about how we're all "cucks" and "shills" and whatnot. But sure, keep telling yourself that is everybody else that's the problem. </div>

Okay idk what you're talking about for the rest of your post so I'll address this. I mean the bots wouldn't work on Reddit. The Donald was fueled by real, live people. Bots wouldn't function in this climate, only real people made it happen. Aka the silent majority isn't so silent anymore.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; I mean the bots wouldn't work on Reddit.

Not quite sure what you mean by this, considering that the very post we're commenting on is proof that bots *do* work on Reddit.

&gt; The Donald was fueled by real, live people. Bots wouldn't function in this climate, only real people made it happen.

Even if the posts in T_D were made by real people, they still purposefully gamed the system in bad faith. As I understand it, T_D operated by getting their entire userbase to just upvote *everything*, which basically turned the sub into a conveyor belt to put shitposts on the frontpage. Maybe the voting was supplemented by bots, or maybe it was just real people with a comparable capacity for independent thought as bots (which is to say, very little). It doesn't really matter, because the end result was the subversion of an algorithm that assumed that a sub of that size would never be able to act with that degree of cohesion. T_D found the flaw in the system, exploited it, and the mods finally patched it when they updated the algorithm. The algorithm wasn't modified to suppress T_D itself, it was modified to cut the legs out from a Reddit-breaking mob behavior of which T_D was the innovator.

&gt; Aka the silent majority isn't so silent anymore.

Except you're so very clearly *not* the majority. You lost the popular vote in the election. Trump has [an absurdly low approval rating.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) You're not a "majority" by any definition, you're a *minority* that has gotten extremely good at making a lot of noise.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh yes, the tired old "allege massive voter fraud without a shred of evidence" argument. Please. If you seriously believe that, then I've got a bridge to sell you. If you actually gave a shit about the democratic process, you'd be pushing for campaign finance reform and anti-gerrymandering laws. But no, you'd rather blame it all on the boogeyman.

Voter ID laws aren't just racist, they fuck over everybody on the lower end of society. All those laws do is make people jump through a bunch of unnecessary bureaucratic hoops in order to claim their *constitutionally guaranteed* right to vote. If you're poor, if you've got to work two jobs, if you're in any sort of situation where you don't have a lot of disposable time to navigate a labyrinth of paperwork, you're much less likely to make it to the polls. We don't have enough Americans voting as it is, and you want to make it even harder? Come the fuck on. It's a smokescreen.

You won the fucking election on a technicality and you're *still* alleging fraud? Are you kidding me? Even when you *win* you play the victim card. Un-fucking-real, you are. You're so deep in denial that you can't even begin to comprehend your own inconsistency.</div>

    <div class="md">The thing about Reddit, and most of the internet, is that the majority rules.  51% of people can nearly completely silence the 49% because no conservative post would get traction.  Its called "tyranny of the majority" and it's actually why the Electoral College and the senate exists.

It sounds like you just really don't like the culture of T_D, and that's fine, but there is no contradiction between calling Reddit overly liberal, and T_D attempting to take credit for "memeing Trump to the White House"</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; 51% of people can nearly completely silence the 49% because no conservative post would get traction.

I'd say that T_D is pretty far from "silenced," even after the algorithm changes. "Normalized the volume" might be a better description, because those algorithm changes were basically only made because T_D exposed a flaw in the algorithm itself: if you had a large enough sub and you just upvoted *everything*, you could basically make a conveyor belt to get posts to the frontpage of r/all. The algorithm was designed with the assumption that a group of that size would never act as a monolith, but clearly that assumption was wrong. It's the "Zerg rush" approach to visibility, and it undermines the nominal purpose of the algorithm of selecting quality content. The way I see it, T_D found an exploit, and the admins patched it.

&gt; It sounds like you just really don't like the culture of T_D, and that's fine, but there is no contradiction between calling Reddit overly liberal, and T_D attempting to take credit for "memeing Trump to the White House"

You're right, it is the culture that I have a problem with. I'm fine with opposing political views, even if I disagree with them, but it's their behavior that I find intolerable. The brigading, their paranoia, and their constant antagonism towards anybody who doesn't 100% agree with them; it's all just a political palette-swap of every intellectual sin that they project onto the Left. If there's one thing that I can't stand, it's hypocritical self-righteousness, and T_D embodies that to it's fullest extent.

Did meme'ing work as an effective marketing tool? Maybe, maybe not. Hard to say, really, in something as complicated as a presidential election. I'm sure the meme war seemed effective *to the people waging it*, but how many minds did it actually change? Did it actually sway people's opinions, or was it all a self-satisfying circlejerk for Trump's base? I've seen plenty of political memes on both sides of the spectrum, and I've rarely ever had a reaction other than to roll my eyes and say "*this* shit again?" Jokes and insults make the side that tells them feel good, but they just alienate the people who aren't already on that side.</div>

    <div class="md">I'll be real, that's kind of sketchy. And I honestly haven't seen that stuff before. But until somebody gives me proof the other side isn't doing that (which they won't because you can't prove that, and r/politics is heavily biased anyway) it's just too hard to say Trump has an upper hand.

To be clear, I'm definitely not saying there isn't bot involvement. But during the election, man we had energy there that you couldn't find anywhere else. There's a reason the donald got banned from the front page. I simply can't chalk that up to bots.

Also, it's worth mentioning that pro-Hillary sources have egregious examples of similar posts.</div>

    <div class="md">Well as far as tD getting banned from the front page I meant it's more because it's human user base was simply just hyper-active.

I guess to clarify my point I mean that honestly I think everyone is using bots. And until I see a clear, large-scale pattern of "bots" favoring one side it's ultimately a net-zero. Logically speaking, if both sides spend $5mm on bots, it essentially evens out no?</div>

Oh, and I'd agree with you on the banning of TD from the front page. It was the abuse of the sticky post mechanism to push a single sub's ideology onto /r/all that got them banned.

    <div class="md">You've cherrypicked three such posts in a week? 

Look at the entire front page of T_D at any time. Right now the lowest # of comments is 32 and the highest is 790, with the average being maybe 100. Looks organic to me.

Now look at the upvotes on the T_D front page. Every post has over 1500 upvotes, most have several thousand, and a few have over 10K. That's what organic activity looks like.

Then look at the numbers on r\esist, r\MarchAgainstTrump, or any of the other dozens of anti-Trump shill reddits. There will be dozens of posts with &lt;100 upvotes and one with 20K+ that's on the front page. That's what a few shills in control of a giant upvote botnet looks like.

    <div class="md">oh yeah, and how many of those donations were organic and came from actual people who live in the state of Georgia where the election was held??? The answer is 5%. Let me say that again, **only 5 % !!!** So Ossoff essentially got every cent of his donation money from all over the country, and only got like 8,000 people to donate who are actually real voters and supporters. And the state that sent the most was California. That's a joke. 
##The democrats got their hollywood celebrity puppets to drum up support from the  ENTIRE COUNTRY and the best they could do was roughly 180,000 donators 
##from a pool of 350 million possible people?????? 
#Wow thats sad, and it totally refutes your false narrative. </div>

    <div class="md">Jesus are you still here?  What a lunatic.  Reading a purposefully placed question mark as a Freudian slip?  It was more of an invitation to prove what you were saying.  But you can't do that, because you're a liar and a fucking moron.

I'll see you in 36-48 hours when you can think of something you think is clever to say.  Something like this, perhaps:

&gt;HAHAHA I can't attack the librul with any facts or substance so I'll seize upon that question mark!  Checkmate, librul!!!!!!!!!!

And, I mean this with all sincerity, please, go fuck yourself.</div>

    <div class="md">Of the special investigation going on into his connections with Russia? The shady firings left and right? Take your pick as Trump falls apart as we speak. 


Oh wait, I already know your stock answers:

A. Hur dur Shillary is worse than Hitler blah blah blah. I voted for the billionaire candidate because he had my interests at heart.


B. Just mad that we won*


C. This is why Trump won. When you call parts of America idiots, racist and sexist, they get sick of it. That's why we voted for the racist, sexist, idiot, to prove a point that we aren't!!1!1!


D. Something something cuck, something something islamists something something EIGHT MORE YEARS. 

Take your pick. </div>

    <div class="md">I agree that it has been forever since we have thought Trump was done, and he has done well in spite of that. And if I came across rude I apologize, just that 9/10 I get a response telling me that someone's removing white culture or that Hillary is the devil. She may have been a poor candidate, but at some point it is beating a dead horse. 

But I mean this Russia stuff is pretty suspicious, even if Trump isn't actively involved. Just the number of ties back to Russia, and ties that seem to have been at least attempted to be hidden, makes me suspicious. 

And for me this isn't a party thing, I just am not comfortable with the thought that Russia could have interfered with our election. Democrat or Republican, we all should at least take steps to ensure that we are not being played, right? </div>

    <div class="md">I mean I like to think I can learn things from passively-aggresively pissing people off, usually I just get told off and banned. No I mean it's definitely suspect but when you look into it it's a really far stretch to think Russia fixed the election considering how many avenues you have to go through and Hillary didn't even get elected and the Democrats fixed their primaries (and that we DO know).

Nobody is comfortable with Russia interfering with anything domestic but the fact is like what 17 agencies investigated the Russia connection and found no evidence of collusion? </div>

He fired Comey because he was being a giant douche for far too long now. I'm surprised he made it out of January.

    <div class="md">oh dude, yes seriously, I had to ragequit watching television that's how angry I was!! Stephen Cold-turdt made me so incensed that now I can't even leave my house because l'm incapable of interacting with the public due to my intense anger issues. I promised myself that I would never watch television again but I was so tempted that l tried a workaround and looked up some highlight video clips of Cold-turdt on my phone. Needless to say, that just made me lose it harder than ever. I broke my phone into a million pieces with a ball peen hammer. This is proving to be quite perilous because a food supply will eventually run out and now I can't order takeout food! There is a very large spare fridge in the garage that I keep my Costco bulk frozen food items in, like neapolitan ice cream, mini vienna franks, hot pockets and such, and that will sustain a person for awhile, but alas this only a stop gap measure that won't work in the long term. My mother had stepped in to rescue me to a degree by bringing over care packages and my clean laundry. However that all ended when she told me that she didn't think that my hatred for Cold-turdt was a justifiable reason to behave the way I have. I SNAPPED! I'm talking I have the power of greyskull and rhythm is a dancer level of SNAP! It's getting kind of hectic when Cold-turdt can turn even your own mother goes against you. What else do you have left after that??? So you know what I did?? I snatched the heavily tin-foil covered plate of chicken tenders she had made for me right out of her hand and put it into the microwave! And I proceeded to set the timer to 77 minutes and 77 seconds, pushed the start button, AND I TURNED MY BACK AND SLOW WALKED AWAY. 

My house burned down as result and I was killed by smoke inhalation. A brilliant scientist lived next door to me, discovered what had happened, and he took advantage of the opportunity of a free untraceable corpse. He re-animated me by shooting me up with 77cc's of a special super male vitality formula. Now I'm a kind of Frankenstein monster/ Solomon Grundy person with insanely severe anxiety issues who can get triggered faster than any known snowflake alive. I have won several highly prestigious quick draw triggering competitions like the San Francisco International Celebrity Safe Space Tournament at Yale University To Benefit Hollywood Refugees In Canada Invitational. As we speak I am in the process of being officially recognized by Guinness World Records.I also have super powered shit posting and trolling abilities now, but the drawback is that my whole body is a cerulean green color and the only sound my mouth can make is

    <div class="md">You were supposed to have a wave in 2016, kiddo. Did you forget already? Do you not remember your favorite FAKE NEWS outlets like HuffPo spreading bogus garbage about how Trump "could cost Republicans the House and Senate", landslide this and that, and so on? They tried their DAMNDEST to get any and every Republican to abandon ship and focus on their own races. And how'd that work out? You lost fucking **everything** at every level. Even if Trump hadnt BTFO Hillary, the GOP would still have the House and Senate. That's really, really embarassing for you.

But we're all supposed to believe that even though your calculus was completely buttfucked then, it's correct now? Heh! </div>

    <div class="md">God damn, are you this pedantic in real life, or only on the Internet?

And 2016 was never supposed to be a "wave."  The republicans were always polling to keep the House and Senate.  And the "calculus" as you call it, was actually pretty accurate when it said Hillary would win by a couple of percentage points, it just didn't factor in 80,000 voters in three states that flipped the EC.</div>

    <div class="md">oh yeah, and how many of those donations were organic and came from actual people who live in the state of Georgia where the election was held??? The answer is 5%. Let me say that again, **only 5 % !!!** So Ossoff essentially got every cent of his donation money from all over the country, and only got 10,000 people to donate who are actually real voters and supporters. And the state that sent the most was California. That's a joke. 
##The democrats got their hollywood celebrity puppets to drum up support from the  ENTIRE COUNTRY and the best they could do was roughly 180,000 donators 
##from a pool of 350 million possible people?????? 
#Wow thats sad, and it totally refutes your false narrative. </div>

    <div class="md">The problem is that you're associating this with a regular House race, which it's not.  Historically, no one gives a flying fuck about special elections, and voter turnout is minuscule.  Most of the American population, Democrats and Republicans, don't even know it's happening.  When the vote is nationwide in 2018, you will see a huge turnout.

And we already have the results of the first round of this election to prove you completely wrong.  Osoff already got 92,000 votes out of the 192k that voted.  So your 10,000 number of people who donated in-state is meaningless.  The votes will be there, even if Osoff doesn't win, to get him this close in such a red district shows where Democrats are.</div>

My 10,000 number is a direct response to your baloney number argument!!!!!!!! There is no logic whatsoever in your above response. You are either delusional or a troll. 2018 is going to be such an epic BTFO'ing of the libtards that it will make history</div>

    <div class="md">Did it seriously take you all day to come up with such a stupid response laden with The_Donald buzzwords?

Your 10,000 number is meaningless.  90,000 people voted for Osoff, who raised 8 million dollars for a *special election* that people don't usually give a fuck about.

There's a special race in fucking Montana where the polls have narrowed to a single digit lead for the republican, where your orange God emperor carried the state by 20 points.  They even had to send Pence and one of the little trump trolls to campaign because it's being fucked up so bad.

People all over cant stand what Trump is doing (or not doing), so you're going to see a lot of blue in 2018, gerrymandering or not.</div>

    <div class="md">Most of those donations came from national donors.

And I won't argue with your point that the liberal ideology is dying, because you made no point, you provided no evidence to back up your thesis.  You just spouted your opinion on something, which I'm not going to argue with.  If I did, it would be tantamount to saying "nuh uh!" and what's the point of that?

If you want to have a real discussion and provide some evidence to back up your claim, then I'm game.  

For instance, I could point out that Democrats have won a majority of total votes in the past few Senate, House, and Presidential elections, but the way things as divided it has led to less elected officials from that party.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, because that ideology is compacted in a few small areas. Democrats are not eager to test their ideology in a hostile environment - thats why they started their safespaces. (And also why straying from the path is punished - i think this one is obvious, but if you want examples give me a poke.) I dont see how race has anything to do with it, but thats also just a Democrat thing i guess; drag race into everything. They are the party of the KKK after all, old habits die hard. We are not just Americans, noooo, we are Latino, black, white, native... And Trump is the racist, obviously. Fucking sexist white male that he is. 

The Democrats lost power in every facet of government, they will lose more in the future. Screenshot this comment and think about it when it happens. 

If youre gonna REEEE some more, get some cardboard and write some angry stuff. Theres bound to be a disgusting, dildo-studded, pussyhatted, grotesque and vulgar riot... I mean protest, going on somehwere. Yet they call us deplorable, hilarious. 

Here is some room so you can have the last word, some people love having the last word: </div>

    <div class="md">What's hilarious is that the left is so opposed to voter ID and investigation into voter fraud. If they're really so sure there's no voter fraud, then they'd let Trump investigate since they know he'd be wrong and just let him embarrass himself. The pushback from the media on it is quite telling.</div>

As far as him talking about

and

    <div class="md">Almost all big cities in the US lean to the left. It's no surprise Hillary won the pop vote, but that's exactly why we have the electoral college. And don't give me that 'unfair' bullshit. The democrats basically start each election with 99 guaranteed electoral votes from four states. (Cali, NY, Wash, Ore) The republicans literally have to win the swing states to even have a chance to win. </div>

    <div class="md">The left (which includes establishment Republicans) have been trying to start a race war for the last 30 years. 

This shit has to stop. Trying to insinuate that the US is somehow a majority racist country is absurd. Its one of the least racist countries in the US and less that 1% of people in the US could truly be labeled "oppressed". 

People need to calm down. 

Shit is just fine in the US. Everyone has american privilege which is the best privilege of all. </div>

    <div class="md">Yep, black on white crime is more common than the opposite as well. But the world is messed up at the moment. Teaching people about Islam is considered islamophobia. Telling people that were all Americans is racist because if youre not focussing on skincolour youre not acknowledging their oppression...

When morale is low people will take up that offer not understanding that they are just being lied to and will be giving up their freedom in return for security and stability.

    <div class="md">Nope, Russia can barely handle itself. The only thing they want is to prevent terrorist from attacking them, stopping the Qatar-Europe Pipeline going through Syria and avoiding WWIII, their economy sucks and they can't afford to get into any conflicts with anyone.

It's also not a conspiracy, they are doing it right in front of you. The most well known one is George Soros who is practically bragging that he's trying to destabilize the U.S dollar. The same guy who bragged about being the cause of the destabilization in the Ukraine. 

There's a guy called George Webb who is doing investigative journalist work researching the cause of countries destabilization like Libya, Syria, Haiti and now what's going on in the U.S. He's a Bernie supporter that's been making daily videos on youtube since last year.

I'm going to link you a cliff notes post that some person on reddit that has kindly made which has links for all the videos with each summary part. I recommend starting at part 1 if you truly would like to know more.

http://archive.is/gx6yQ

Even if you are concern trolling me here, I'm still going to post this so other people might check it out.

edit: Going to link [another site](https://idraintheswamp.com/) which records more facts that correlate with the George Webb series for another source. </div>

    <div class="md">What your saying is valid and I do believe the billionaire class is trying to influence the world to support their agenda. What that is I have no idea (most likely to profit). As to all the misinformation on social media I'm going to agree with our intel agencies. It seems as though a foreign entity (most likely Russia) is trying to cause Americans to be divided. A weaker divided America will make it much easier for Russia to get their sanctions lifted especially since they may have put a pro Russia president in the WH. Why do you think there are so many connections to Russia in this admin? What would our bi-partisan intel agencies gain by lying about that? If the intel agencies lied about that and the truth came out the people would completely lose faith in the justice system on both sides of the aisle.   </div>

    <div class="md">it's something i've actually done. when that stupid fucking bidenbro sub sprouted up (which was so obvious they were trying to manufacture meme magic) I posted the video of Biden groping children and it got a bunch of upvotes (I don't remember how many exactly, I want to say 40, but I didn't look after the first hour) and it took the mods 6ish hours to remove the video and ban me. this was around 1pm PST too, not the middle of the night.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree with you, I would suspect ALL other political subs do this. Question is, are the upvotes in posts based on users or by bots? This (and stickied posts) were part of the reason T_D got pushed down with the algorithm. Shouldn't these subreddits be punished in a similar way? I also am anti-Trump, but there seems to be a blind faith following in the majority of political subreddits that is very disturbing to me. </div>

    <div class="md">im super pro trump. still think both sides are botting too much. here and twitter. impossible for real people to talk to each other.

gridlock. idk whos responsible for botting on either side, but the result is just gridlock and progress stops.

as a trump guy my only issue is there is there is only one t_d and 20 anti trump subs botting. doesnt seem fair. i dont really want to see either at this point. idk if the libs are in the don or people have just gone crazy (or crazy people think its ok to act crazy) but they are stooping lower and lower. constantly fighting to be at a lower level than each other with their insults. i can sort of understand, because it is kind of maddening to argue with bots all day, but things are so extreme they just post to get reactions at this point.

its fucked up. go back to work. cant help the needy if we arent working and just sit around manipulating data all day.</div>

I appreciate your honesty, most of your side isn't willing to admit to any sort of fault, whether it's yours or just that of your party. Mine either for that matter...

My concern with t_d is when they over extend themselves into more serious, curated subreddits like /r/conservative. Memes and hyperbole have a place but not outside their subs, left or right </div>

    <div class="md">i mean im a born republican but my party makes me a bit sick. i see the left as far far worse tho.

donald is the wildcard, and i hope it makes both parties reform. unfortunately it seems to have made both parties try to use him to establish themselves as better and stronger without the reform.

its all a joke at this point. someone gets banned from the don and the note is 'muslim spotted'. people react and say thats racist. 

like who gives a fuck. its all fake offense and triggering online.

nothing will get better if we dont think critically, look at what has to change, and fix it. nothing will get better if we spam senators phone lines and town meetings and subreddits. 

drain the swamp is a great idea. the greatest  from his campaign imo. but it feels impossible at this point. no one is willing to concede any power or admit any fault.

i really feel like i got to get to DC. they need fresh blood. if i cant do that, i will get involved locally. i already audit my county and know the local politicians. its just so much fucking work, but anything is better than staring at bullshit on the internet all day. ya feel? we need to stop yelling and take some responsibility for our own neighborhoods and faults.</div>

    <div class="md">I get the sentiment. But you have to admit, you guys must feel more represented than us. For a majority of us democrats and liberals, our representatives won't even hold townhalls anymore, citing 'violent liberals'. 

No constituents ought to feel ignored by their government. It's how uprisings start. A lot of folks say it will never happen, especially from liberals. But if you push someone enough, they'll do what it takes. The one thing democrats had that republicans didn't was that they towed the line between both parties, and were too afraid to outright alienate the right. Trump/GOP has no problem alienating the center-left/far left and I fear for their well-being should good sense not prevail.

Alls well that ends well, best of luck to you and yours, mate. Welcome to the new administration, same as the old administration is how the saying goes, I believe.</div>

    <div class="md">oh yea man. im still on cloud 9. i love the fact that he won and will remember it forever. im glad i get a bit of representation now, and know i might never again. i am prolly the definition of white privileged in most peoples eyes. parents did well made a cpl mil. took a risk started their own account firm. 2 person team, occasionally some help. still i am armenian and my great grandparents lose their land, home, families, and were forced to leave the country during the turkish genocide. other side is the poorest of irish immigrants.  im white privlidge, but that shit is not free. that shit was 100 years of saving every penny, something i still do. invest every cent. its just who i am and i cant be faulted for it, i try my best.

there already is an uprising man. i can see the kids burning down their campus. burning down pipelines. spamming news and media. i believe it, i can see it. its just not being fought with ar-15s.

and no i dont feel bad when town halls are canceled. especially when a bunch of loud mouth idiots gather and go to a meeting in mass and shout shit. that is now how debates are won (well maybe trump won some that way) but not locally. you need a spokesperson, a plan, and a well constructed criticism and solution. i see websites posting telephone numbers to call representatives. thats the worst. if someone actually has enough motivation to do that they can find the number. these websites just encourage botting and people with no clue to clog a line of communication with their own representative. he doesnt want to listen because he has to deal with bullshit all day, just like anyone like me on reddit arguing with mostly bots.

its boy who cried wolf. like with flynn. if you are against every single member of trumps team and fight him at every corner, why would he listen to advice saying flynn was corruptable?

democrates alienated me along time ago my friend. when i finished my masters and the only option left was a shitty job. my starting salary is not enough to pay for my parents house property tax. its less than their insurance premium for 3 people. how am i suppose to succeed my parents when i am given an education and nothing to do with it. i attended a high school that has ranked #1 public math in science multiple times in the past decade. i know how to think. i literally lost job chances at big 4 firms to immigrants who got booted from the lottery anyways. they were cheaper, and more likely to work 80 hour weeks and not complain. how can they complain when it means their visa is gone. corporate abuse. financial systems do it too. corrupted and 2008 will repeat eventually. hire foreign slaves. manipulate the market. take avg peoples 401ks. market crash when the boomers hit retirement... not good. many like me will not be able to keep their parents housed and cared for.
 
the game is clearly rigged against me. but i am telling you far more people have it worse. but i have good ideas. i can help people , just need a chance.

i have no problem alienating most of the left. if anyone quotes anything without doing research on it i can just disregard. if you arent reading the executive orders yourself, you dont deserve to have a voice this loud. people just like to argue against things they dont understand and it is holding us all back. regresslive liberalism. where are the JFK era liberals? remember when liberals were all about the working man? the working man with 1 representative voicing their concern? now they dont work, and all the men go and voice their concerns at the same time into megaphones. dont wonder why i chose to ignore it. its just noise.

i am rooting for you man. i really am. im not interested in helping the liberals fix their problems. i want to help the needy and those around me. my town, my neighbors, my friends, my family, my party. thats my circle of control. i hope you can get involved and come up with some good plans to move your party forward. you fix your problems. ill try to fix ours. and well meet in the middle in the future hopefully. do whats best for all, but im not to sympathetic after this election. sorry. its been rough.

i really dont care about identity politics. what you want to call climate change. what you want to call terrorism (from islams, white people, nutjobs, christians, BLM, anyone). i just dont care anymore.

get good jobs to people. help the poor. rebuild schools and inner cities. fix the prison cycle. stop federal dependency for individuals and corporations. and stop burdening everyone in the 80-250k range with the bill. stop letting people abuse the handouts. the upper middle class doesnt have any more resources to pay for it. i have health insurance but dont even have the time to see a dr. nearly everyone i work with does 60 hour weeks and is in poor health. the people i audit grind 40 hour weeks for pensions in mindless gov jobs.  i just dont see how thats helping anyone. red tape creates work for white working slaves. we can do so much better.

idk i can go for days. we got lots of issues. at least we can agree on that. i think we can also agree that neither of us are bad people, but is hard to get stuff done when everyone wants to take charge. need structure and opportunity for all. less bullshit and noise.</div>

    <div class="md">Applause to you, man! From a liberal! Folk like you are trying to keep the aisle 'undivided'.

It's really rare when I can say that I wholly agree with the values you've presented, despite your status as a T_D supporter. Though I have to admit, I do not fit into the typical stereotypical "liberal" position. I do hold *some* conservative views.

I wish more people could see things as you and I do. Personally, I do not believe taxing those in the (I shift here) 80-100k range unduly is fair, though I must say 200k and above, there is no reason that I can find that would exempt them from more taxable contributions than the poorer. I say this as someone who grew up, and is currently (and fervently trying to escape) the sub 50k earning range.

&gt; get good people good jobs

I couldn't agree more. I know we have a lot of issues, and I know we will never EVER settle them. But it's times like these we have to take what we can get. If for one moment, we can hold our WWI-esque Christmas Truce, then I am satisfied that the upper echelon have retained their humanity.

Climate change, unfortunately, I can not budge on. It's an inevitable, horrific truth that will only worsen in my worldview. Terrorism from ISIS, in my eyes, is a result of our actions from pre-9/11 times and onward. Karma, one might say but I believe military action is the only way to vanquish it; again, here I depart from the typical liberal narrative.

Seriously, I wish more were as well-reasoned as you. Unfortunately, I view our president as a buffoon and a traitor, bur your views and those who see things as you do: I see that. I respect those beliefs even if I cannot bring myself to ascribe to them myself.</div>

    <div class="md">Don't take this the wrong way by thinking that I'm trying to say your ideas are wrong but something to consider is maybe you haven't just done enough deep research yourself to fully understand what is truly going on. That you might be just seeing a facade top layer of information put out to dis-inform everyone.

I was sucked into this as well and I would consider myself to be more of a moderate person rather than left or right only. I spent enough spare time to look at the facts and not just what someone claimed was true, even when I thought they were legitimate sources at the time.

While yes, terrorism groups including ISIS have been spurred by our actions, it's not just a reaction-response only from them. We have had corrupt officials help make these groups bigger as they wanted to use them as tools to achieve their personal agendas. So while these corrupt officials were part of our nation, the rest of us aren't responsible for these crimes. 

Check out George Webb on YouTube, [this is a good place to start on day 84](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioFGJmrvai0). He's a Bernie supporter who has been doing deep investigative work on recent events that have happened in the middle-east, and other places where a lot of shady things have occurred. 

If you have time, I suggest you watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDK1aCqqZkQ) about man-made climate change that interviews Dr. Patrick Moore, PHD in Ecology and founder of Greenpeace. They discuss what's real and what isn't and why.

The fact is that our nation needs both conservatives and liberals to have a healthy functioning society. The liberals create and the conservatives implement, without each other the society stalls and starts to decay.

Ideologies are nothing but a label that describes the type of personality you have. More open minded, artistic but chaotic people are usually Liberal and More close minded, orderly and stable people are usually Conservative. They aren't something to be used as a tribal division where you should divide yourself into groups with other people who have similar ideologues. All it does is create polarization and either makes the two different groups fight, or one becomes the slave of the other. *edit: Free speech is required for both types of people to come together and have a discussion about what is the best way to improve our society.

Check out Dr. Jordan Peterson if you want to find out more about the psyche behind what is going on in today's western culture.

[Here's an interview by Dave Rubin(liberal) with Dr. Peterson.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJSJcPKA1Ug&amp;t=1s), who's a psychologist and tenured professor of psychology at the University of Toronto.

Again, I'm not trying to convince you to change your mind. Just trying to share more information for you to help make a more informed decision about your stances. </div>

    <div class="md">Thanks for the sources. I think you are saying smarts doesn't matter because both sides can be correct.

I tend to focus on the worst outliers when I refer to the liberals, tho I know at the end of the day we are still the greatest country and full of the greatest people.

Just so frustrating to see his misinformation you are talking about. Makes my blood boil to see people riot over trump. They need to listen for a bit and not be so rash.

Honestly I do believe many politicians want our downfall. The only path to global leaders and global power is with our downfall. Once you have all the money and power in America that is the only next place to go.

Maybe I'm a nut but I believe high ranking officials on both sides want this downfall to consolidate control. That's why it's so great that a guy who sells hotel rooms and shit won. Fuck em both. Michele could have run in 2024 if Hilary was in for 8 and it would have been 48 years of bush Clinton Obama presidents. That is fucking insane. We need to reset a bit.

The politicians don't represent their constituents like they should. None of the biggest names got there by just being good people.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, I really think term limits needs to happen sooner rather than later. These career politicians stay in power by crook and hook, they get offered so much lobbying money that they can just throw it at their next campaign and silence their opposition. Repeat that a few times and you get a swamp creature.

If you would like to find out the real truth of what is hijacking the "liberal side" even though they aren't classical liberals anymore you should watch this, it's only an 18 min. long video but it's well worth your time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTxmKc80wUw

Jordan Peterson has spent probably 30 or 40 years studying this and when you hear what he says and explains how the "regressive leftists" function, it really hits you in the gut. </div>

    <div class="md">Thanks man. I know there are plenty of old liberals out there. Non sjw types.  

The reason I give such a high number is because in the Tristate where I grew up 100 to 200 k is middle class. For example in Florida where I livenow a 200k job is 400k equivenelt in New Jersey. So I can't ever save up down here and move back home. The scales are a bit broken is all I'm saying. My 15 year experience managers pull in the same as my brothers starting salary up there.

Trump is just himself man. He's no buffoon. Buffoons don't make it to the White House. Bush was thought of the same way. They are both authentic. I even see Obama as more of a buffoon. Sure he can talk well but his policies are egotistical bullshit. All he did was healthcare and drone strike. Both premiums and body counts are up way to much for me to consider him smart. He's a smiling face and reads off a TelePrompter. I see that as worse than a guy who says what's on his mind.

We gave Obama a chance. Maybe not a fair one but we didn't fight. I think trump is a pawn. He knows little about politics and how info is used to destroy, instead of money. Both sides should be using him to get things we all agree need work fixed, instead of arguing over the extreme things we disagree on.

I hate how he presidency has become four years to shove your shit through the houses. The GOP has trump by the balls a bit, his only ally even tho he hates half of them. If the dems and media worked with him a bit I bet we would get more accomplished. They are forcing him to a corner and to choose a side. We all are doing the same, and no one wants to be neutral.

Thanks for the response and best of luck.</div>

As a T_D poster, I hope OP could do this same kind of investigation toward T_D and reveal the evidence if bots also truly run rampant in that sub. This way we can come to a fair and fact based conclusion rather than just brush things off as "well the other political subs do this too" I just want some damn integrity and if reddit admins won't do it then its up to the users.</div>

T_D doesn't even need bots. The numbers there are huge to begin with, but more importantly, why WOULD T_D bot? Trump won. There's no incentive to do it, and nobody who would be interested in financially backing it.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes SIGNIFICANT botting. As in "contextually related to the conversation we are currently having"

We have Brick Bot, a bot that gives you a brick to add to Trumps Wall.

We have Coat Bot, a bot that gives every patriot a coat.

I think theres a "Bill Clinton is a Rapist" bot.

And I think theres also bot that reminds us how many miles the trump train has taken.

Those are bots, but those are not the bots that we are talking about. Theyre just gags.

You're talking about Pro-Trump inflation bots, of which TD doesn't have. There's no evidence of it, and you're more than welcome to scrape the sub (as several people do every day) for the data and show evidence, but you won't find any because nobody has. The only shady bots in TD belong to the /r/marchagainsttrump guys and Shareblue and theyre used to downvote every thread and every comment. And those are not our bots.</div>

    <div class="md">What sucks is that while OP managed to track down the fraudulent nature of r/MarchAgainstTrump it was easier because it opened as a dead sub and continues as a dead sub. When such a significant percentage of the activity is centered around the same group of accounts it's much easier to put the pieces together.

There is almost certainly the same kind of fuckery happening in subs like r/politics but it's far more difficult to put it together because any shilling/botting/rulebreaking can hide among each other.

While I haven't found any real lead on it, and I'm trying, I'm fairly certain there's some shilling/botting for The Independent going on in there (and maybe other subs too). The most trashy clickbait,, sensationalized headline,  no-content articles get upvoted to 20k/30k/40k or more very quickly and almost always gets gilded (payment for posting perhaps?). It's almost *always* The Independent when that happens. That can't be a coincidence. 

The mods are really passive about that stuff though. I'm 100% convinced they know that sub is going to hell and is compromised content wise and is just trying to clean up the comments section.

Last year I rooted out several accounts to the mods in r/politics that were very clearly sold accounts or caved into shilling. It was painfully obvious when you go from casually posting in science based subreddits ovr 3 years to exclusively posting several Trump hit pieces daily in r/politics from only 1 or 2 sites. 

Now the shilling is becoming more sophisticated and using a network of accounts to avoid that. They still have to make up some phony account activity to look legit on the surface but even some minor investigations can root them out. Another account I rooted out in r/politics last summer has a single comment that got like 3-4 karma. Very first post was in a reposted r/AskReddit thread and it was the top comment of the originally posted thread. Almost certainly coordinated with whoever posted the thread initially.</div>

    <div class="md">This happens in so man subs for all kinds of special interest groups. My favorite is talking about controversial things and writing a corporations name in and then a short time later having an argument where they defend the company to the extent of saying it's not the companies fault for making money and people dying because of it. Bots/ paid internet presence are the new craze. Pretty soon your whole Reddit experience will be fake. Every user will have their own entire universe of bots instead of real people. Everyone will be so fucking proud of being in while being so disconnected from reality. All the big money ideas will rule. </div>

    <div class="md">Bots and shills.

Someone who doesn't know this comes to reddit and sees this crap ( a form of lying) on the front page every time they visit.

They then get a false impression of Trump being unpopular. Basically this is negative astroturfing. 

If someone is willing to put in this kind of effort on reddit, think of all the negative coverage in the mainstream media. Same thing.

In fact, I think of the recent elections in France. The media took it easy on Macaroni while going after LePen like a pack of dogs.

The media is pushing a narrative about Russian election hacking. But they themselves are the biggest election hackers.</div>

    <div class="md">Pretty good research into this. Do you know if there is a concrete way to get at voting data, otherwise they aren't "breaking" any rules, just posting through bot accounts. 
Will advertisers flee if the "primarily political" posts run into higher frequency and more rampant posting on several subreddits? Because if this is allowed on march, and t_d isn't, that'd be hilarious. They'd obvy circumvent this, and it'd just escalate. 
Now what would be true bot mastery would be kicking this into high gear, with mass vote manip and posting on both sides, that'd be a real spectator sport. 
Oh well, reddit has been shit for a while. Can't wait for the next semi-anon public forum to spring up. </div>

    <div class="md">Just throwing this out there, but don't all the news / Politics / link sharing sub posts consist 90% of RSS feed bots?

If you go to any news sub, it is literally just an RSS feed of all the major news organizations. It's completely pointless to read them now, as the points don't do anything anymore to help rate which news is more important to people through the voting system.

As well, this research doesn't do much to look at which particular stories are being pushed the most through vote manipulation, which is the primary concern. Votes and views control what content most users see, not whether a link is posted via an rss feed. 

I guess what i want to say overall is: This is a lot of research into something that we already knew. Thank you for putting forth the effort to create a good visual representation of how pretty much any and every news sub works, but you have not really touched on the subject of how they are abusing votes to create pseudo editors of the new pages on reddit, and you haven't been able to provide information on which stories or which story sources are being pushed the most.

It would be more interesting to look at what they are posting, and see if there are any correlations with certain domain names, and see if those domain names are owned by related individuals or the same individual. That would be more interesting.</div>

They only allow domains that almost universally support their anti trump agenda.

    <div class="md">To late, OP. Neutrality is no longer a part of Reddit, it's pretty much a propaganda machine at this point. There is only one dominant narrative on Reddit and it's censoring other perspectives. So people wont mind the blatant usage of bots and other dubious tactics because they're already onboard with the narrative. </div>

    <div class="md">Annnnnndddddd reddit will do nothing because that sub is devoted to hating Trump. The dirty open secret, which has been proven time and again, is that reddit has been flooded with bots engaged in anti-Trump behavior and the people running reddit do not care.

    <div class="md">Im fascinated when the other side INSISTS that TD is all bots. 

This, by the way, based solely on the fact that they just CAN'T believe that we have that many numbers. No evidence. Just a refusal to believe it. Meanwhile, someone is scraping the TD sub every single day, and everything checks out. The only bots they find are anti-trump downvote bots. 

So the bots in TD arent even our bots. And we get accused of astro turfing. Typical leftist projection</div>

I go onto that subreddit and resist all the time and talk major shit because it's obvious as fuck they force several post a day to the front page. It's so fake the comments are always pro Trump ffs , it's absurd! AND HYPOCRITICAL!</div>

    <div class="md">As someone who works for a eCom company, just about any online statistics are completely false in regards to followers, subscriptions, impressions, clicks, posts, etc.

The Left is completely destroyed and demotivated right now. Only the most ardent and loud are left, screaming up a storm of non-existent "imminent threats" and the like. It's all robots.

I have no worry about the direction of this Proud Country under the leadership of the God Emperor Trump. He is doing the job in a brilliant manner for anyone paying attention.

Truly in for a great next 7 1/2 years 'PEDES! Never forget that Trump is a man of America!</div>

    <div class="md">It doesnt make any difference in this case but its worth noting that userhistorybot does not keep track of poststhat were deleted. Its not reading the live feed and keeping track.

That matters if analysing somethings.

For example r / jokes removes jokes that are pro trump . I looks like i havent posted many places except  the donald however in reality i post many places but the moderstors remove the posts because they are protrump.

I have probably posted 50 pro trump jokes to r jokes yet only one joke survived the anti trump moderators.</div>

This just in, a top Reddit mod is a Trump supporter. Fantastic evidence there, guys. Fuck's sake. Never mind chatlogs of mods coming out and saying they wish they could just eradicate the sub. Fugg lmao</div>

    <div class="md">All of these links lead to comments that say, "Look at how many upvotes their posts have, that can't be real!".

That's not evidence of anything, it's just general incredulity. This post proves that the implicated accounts are doing something that's physically impossible for a human to do.

See the difference? I mean, I suspect that some users/entities in r/T_D are doing this too, because it's a sufficiently large community, and many of the users there feel their community needs to look big and well-supported to "oppose" the rest of Reddit, but.. Nobody has really proved that to the same standard as this, and you're just making your positions look dumb by saying they have.</div>
