    <div class="md">You just explained this entire sub and any situation where anyone defends themselves or others. Are they all Karen’s? 

The common meaning of Karen is someone who shows off their entitlement by demanding something. Usually something that doesn’t actually affect them. I left out the part about white women but hey I’m not arguing that here. I never demanded anything, never showed entitlement, I guess you could argue that I did defend someone when it didn’t affect me but I’d say my comment was showing the hypocrisy of hate speech which has affected me. 

Notice how you have a different meaning than me, Wikipedia, 13 thousand people on urban dictionary, the other guy who replied to this post, all the lgbt people from the thread I was banned from? Kinda proves my point. 

Good thing being annoying isn’t a rule because people without **average temperament who put themselves in this situation** to comment on my post would get banned. Who knew... your argument even applies to you.</div>

Hell, you can be gay and choose not to date or have sex with men and marry and have sex with a woman instead.

    <div class="md">Basically a joke to **you**. Just like that “slur” is a joke to me. Who are you and who am I to decide what is and isn’t a joke? Well it’s decided on a very basic definition that isn’t based on your opinion but on the opinion of the victims and abusers of words. Stop telling me what you think a word means while I’ve posted evidence from multiple places of what the word means to a lot of people.

**i never once said they are equal, read better**</div>

    <div class="md">**new mod message**

“Racism against white people doesn’t exist in any meaningful way”

https://imgur.com/a/QLow1tj

Banned because of Mods opinion. **mod then proceeds to break the subreddit rule and attempt to personally attack me.**

Muted right after

https://imgur.com/a/0cnOXT1

Just an FYI. Refer to my previous post. You can call me Karen all you want it doesn’t bother me. I couldn’t care less about participating r/pics and am completely okay with being banned for bigotry if stating the f word breaks the rules. The reason I’m posting this is because I clearly haven’t broken any rules and a mod decided based on their opinion that I did. 

All I did was defend someone getting harassed by dozens of people for stating that they think “Karen” is offensive, that person btw deleted all their comments. If that makes me entitled I guess I’m a Karen.

    <div class="md">Sorry didn’t realize the point of this sub was to quit bitching and move on when mods abuse their status to censor opinions. 

I also didn’t realize by pointing out that abuse and letting others come to their own conclusions, that I’m demanding something based on my privilege/entitlement or that I’m trying to solve a problem that doesn’t remotely affect me. Seems like you have no fucking clue what makes someone a Karen but are attempting to use it as an insult. 

Thanks for proving one of my dumbass points. You have your own meaning for a word outside of what the word meant when it was created and what it means to the majority.

    <div class="md">Hahaha unironically calling someone a Karen while being part of a sub made up of Karen’s (based on your inaccurate definition). Hmm actually, complaining about something legitimately wrong being done specifically to you is not what makes someone a Karen. 

Ironically coming from a literal Karen who cried about a show not making money. Hahaha

Im guessing that you a someone who gets called Karen when you are acting like one, so you have started thinking that it's people being discriminatory against you bc you are a middle aged white women. When really it has nothing to do with how you look and everything to do with how you act.</div>

    <div class="md">Never been called a Karen before this. I have been told that I can’t say a word because it is offensive to people. Looking at it logically, taking a words meaning like women/bundle of sticks/cigarette/tired and a few people turning it into an insult meant to offend a group, is considered offensive. So logically a word that was literally created to offend white women and is only used by the majority to insult people might be offensive to at least one person. 

The stupid hill to die on is to say Karen doesn’t offend anyone.

Edit: you saying it has nothing to do with race or gender means absolutely nothing. Again that’s based on your opinion. I can link Wikipedia and urban dictionary that has 13 thousand people who define it targeting white women specifically. Like I said. Evidently a word used a relative few in an offensive way makes that word offensive regardless of how you, personally, define it.</div>

    <div class="md">It seems like your entire opinion is based around the fact that Wikipedia says its targeted towards white women. Pretty sure any race can be a Karen, because it has nothing to do with skin color and everything to do with attitude.

    <div class="md">Wikipedia, urban dictionary (again 13k ppl think this vs 1.5k downvotes), media articles, reddit threads and comments, and even with the definitions that say it’s only based on attitude - Karen is a woman’s name. 

Oh and I’d go as far as to say the mod who banned me thinks that as well since they said and I quote “racism against white people doesn’t exist in any meaningful way” which to me implies they are defending the word Karen targeting the white race. I mean why else would any rational person bring that up?

It’s meaningless to the overall argument as I’ve stated before but post the origins of the word Karen since it has nothing to do with race. 

I don’t get why you are even arguing this in any form. I’ve stated multiple times that my position is that Karen can be offensive to some. That is the most rational assumption without even going over any arguments. The only reason anyone would ever deny that is if “racism against white people doesn’t exist” or because they use the word Karen all the time, don’t use it in an offensive way, and don’t want it to be a no no word. Very ironic because I used the same argument years ago when I was told I had no opinion because the word I used with a different meaning was offensive to some people.

Hate speech - abusive or threatening speech or writing that expresses **prejudice against a particular group**, especially on the basis of **race**, religion, or **sexual orientation.**

Particular group is white middle aged women like you’ve agreed. 

Race - white women as outlined by several sources. You can’t even argue that most sources don’t say “white” in the definition

Sexual orientation - definitions include “women” but the word is also a woman’s name so...

Seriously it would be easier to argue that the earth is flat than to say Karen isn’t offensive to anyone.</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t even want to convince people that it’s hate speech, I used the definition of hate speech to prove that I can be seen as offensive to some people. No one has even come close to agreeing that it is or might be offensive to at least one person.

I tend to use exaggerated points/arguments to reveal obvious conclusions that I initially state.

    <div class="md">No my point is that the word is used an insult that many have linked to race and gender which means the actual racists and offensive people have offended at least someone using that word.

An obvious argument is looking at another slur that has multiple meanings. If one homophobe offends an lgbt member with a slur that person now associates the meaning of the word to be offensive. It doesn’t matter what you or I think the homophobic word means. It doesn’t matter what you or I think Karen means. if there is a large number of people who use and know the word to be an insult someone’s race and sexual orientation, then it is offensive to at least one person. That’s the very basic entry level argument that is so logical that, again, earth is flat is easier to defend than to disagree with. 

Again, The entire point of my initial comment was to show the people bullying one guy for saying they think the word is offensive to them was to prove that it can be offensive to at least one person (didn’t think I had to specifically say 1 person instead of “some”). That’s it. Full stop. 1000% logically sound.</div>

    <div class="md">Sigh. Let’s just go with yes

 but here’s my terms of service style explanation that has to cover every tiny issue. My point is that if it can be offensive based on racial and sexual orientation discrimination to one person then the OP shouldn’t be getting bullied because of some random opinions as it’s most likely commonly used in that way. 

*like the f word is commonly used as hate speech even though it was/is used by the majority to mean something else*

Edit: I’ll end it here. If you can’t dispute that the f word was used by the majority to mean something other than hate speech and you can’t disprove that a majority of people use Karen racially and targeting women, then the argument is pretty much over apart from little jabs that won’t progress the discussion anywhere. You’re the one who hasn’t disputed any of my points while I dispute all of your opinions and arguments with logical evidence and sources that you can check for yourself. You haven’t moved the discussion at all.</div>

    <div class="md">By stating my argument and evidence a billion times so that you can properly respond to them? Lmao. What do you want me to do? Change my opinion because you told me to and not because you made any arguments? All this thread is, is me basically talking to a brick wall that occasionally doesn’t block the sun from my eyes. 

If you can’t even form a counter argument after being directly called out for not having one... why would you ever claim I’m the reason this “discussion” hasn’t moved forward. Christ</div>

    <div class="md">The mod literally said you're trying to equate the two words, and then your rebuttal to that is you playing victim and crying because someone called you a Karen. You even pulled up sources to try and villify the ppl calling you a Karen. I just don't understand how someone can get that upset about being called out for using a homophobic slur, and then double down like that. Like you really wanna use the word faggot that bad? Go ahead, but don't be surprised and get upset when people call you out for using the word.</div>

    <div class="md">Hahah. My “rebuttal” was calling out the mod for enforcing a non existent rule. It was meant to point out how stupid the mod is by asking how that specifically breaks the rules. I’ve been banned without breaking any rules before. Telling a mod I didn’t do what they are claiming never works. 

I never equated them and even said fag is worse but please, don’t take what I say literally, don’t understand the very basic point of my response, and please do fall for low level bait. 

“Pulled up sources to try and vilify” 

What? I pulled up sources to prove that Karen is an offensive word based on examples of what makes other words offensive. People also called me Karen after I sourced anything and you’re implying that I care about being called Karen. 

“Called out for using a homophobic slur”

So just saying fag not directed at anyone is using a slur? Did I just slur? I’m so sorry. 

Yes I’m crying my heart out like a Karen because I was unrightfully banned on a subreddit that you are a part of which is literally full of Karen’s based on most of the definitions in these comments.</div>

    <div class="md">You have to reach critical mass in society to be taken seriously about protecting speech or anything else. There are lots of individuals and groups that would love protection under the law or acceptance in society that don't get it. It seems reasonable to not over regulate or get overly sensitive in our culture. When we do pass laws, we seem to scope them to a thing, not a group. Ie race, sex, sexual preference. This also seems good. 

You'll just have to keep fighting the good fight and assemble all the Karens to make your case to the people. 

What does the group identify as though? What is the acceptable, non pejorative word for karen?</div>

    <div class="md">I agree -- Racial and Gender discrimination is scoped at its highest level and isn't specific to races or genders. 

This is not true with other groupings though. The phantom limb syndrome people nor Karen's enjoy legal protection. If they seek to do so, there is a clear path other groups have taken to reach legal protection.

E: to be clear, the flaw in your argument, is that Karens are neither a gender, race or sexual orientation.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree with you too and I agree with your edit to certain extent. There’s obviously a difference between offensive words considered hate speech from a historical POV (ie persecution, murder, etc) and groups who want protection can get it. My argument however is simply that Karen can be **offensive** to someone. From my understanding hate speech carries that historical aspect that most slurs don’t have so that is not my argument (anymore, idr if I’ve said it is).

The point I make is that if you look at other offensive words that have multiple meanings, while they are not equal in offense, they are very similar in terms of what makes them offensive. ie it doesn’t matter if the majority use the an offensive word in an inoffensive way (fag is a perfect example although many slurs also work like cracker or gringo), if a small minority use it offensively, that is to literally offend or hurt someone. 

That’s why I keep saying it doesn’t matter what any individual person or group thinks the word means when there is evidently a large group of people who use the word racially and targeting a specific gender. I agree that the word is used by a majority to not target specific race or gender and the few times I’ve used it hasn’t been offensively towards a group. However looking at this objectively the argument I made is pretty logical.</div>

    <div class="md">Thanks for the response. I think we're not too far off. The only thing I think that objectively makes the words different from each other is time. None of the banned slurs or non banned slurs started off banned, they were all commonplace to the degree that society had to change to accommodate it. Karen is so new it hasn't had time to go through the process naughty words go through to become unusable. This could happen, if the karens band together and advocate for change, while their opposers are still using it. 

Of course, you could also get into the question of choice, but I'm not sure how I feel about that. It is not a choice what gender, sexual orientation, or race you are. You choose to be a nazi or a karen, so those are different in that way. I don't really believe in the idea of free will though, so for me, that line is extremely blurry, but I understand the point people make with it.</div>
