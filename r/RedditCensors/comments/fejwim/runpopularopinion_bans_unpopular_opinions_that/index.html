If you post, Bernie is the best ever or Hillary is amazing, you're fine. You'll fall through the cracks. But anything that goes against leftist narrative? You're gone. I was permanently banned for voicing my opinion and I'm sure many others have too. Reddit is a fucking awful platform and it didn't use to be this way. 

I'm just waiting for r/TheDonald to be banned after it's censorship and quarantine lol. How the fuck do you even do that? It literally has NOTHING to do with anything against Reddit policy but they don't like anything they don't agree with so it HAS TO GO apparently. It's fucking horrible, I'm shocked that this sub is still here in all honesty.</div>
