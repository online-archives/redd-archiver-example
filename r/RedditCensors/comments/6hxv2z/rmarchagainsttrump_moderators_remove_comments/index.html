I won't speculate on whether this was an honest mistake, but it naturally resulted in misinformation and spread to reddit.

Almost 10,000 people saw this graphic and took it at face value. [Users who pointed out that this was inaccurate had their comments removed](http://imgur.com/a/Jo2yx) and the thread was locked.

This is dangerous behavior, and sadly it's becoming par for the course.

    <div class="md">These people are holding onto a thread and everyday some of them have their threads break.  When this happens they lose their minds to different degrees and this false hope they put in the MSM lies... and only makes their fall that much worse.  Because there's nothing more dangerous than a weak ideology and false hope.  

This is what Nietzsche was worried about when he said "God is dead and we killed him."  Nietzsche wasn't a fan of the god theory, but he knew the value of having a metaphysical belief at the top of your psychological hierarchy.  he knew that normal people were weak and needed such. 

People with metaphysical beliefs at the top of their hierarchy have a foundation that can never truly be destroyed, but people without metaphysical beliefs are very vulnerable to psychological collapse/nervous breakdowns as their ideologies can be challenged and destroyed.  Which can bring into question all their beliefs and leave them in despair or a personal hell.  

Those people who are angry and rioting in the streets... they worshiped government and now government (their god) has betrayed them and that brings into question all of their beliefs.  They cannot psychologically withstand the fact that their god has, in their eyes, betrayed them and it is shattering their reality.  Look at the chaos these people live in.  They're so lost they don't even know what is real anymore.  They believe in 50+ genders, that a man is a woman as long as he dresses as a woman and all sorts of other madness.  They desperately seek a holy grail (virtue) to cure their sickness.  Yet they will never obtain it and as this reality grips them they descend further and further into hell.

Throughout all of humanity's history... we have believed in the metaphysical and used such belief to set rules for how to treat one another.

The Bible and many other faiths have warned that those without metaphysical beliefs will end up attacking those who do, but I don't believe they're doing this just out of smite.  I believe it's also the drowning man syndrome.  These people are desperate, drowning in their own hells and grasping onto anyone who isn't drowning in an attempt to either bring you down with them or desperately use you to bring themselves back up.  

If you pay close attention you will realize... they are not seeking the approval of one another.  They seek the approval of the metaphorical father figure which is those who disapprove their actions.  

An example would be a movie/tv show where there's the hardass father figure like Red from That's 70's show who always disapproves of what his son does, but on those rare occasions where Red looks at his son and gives him his approval... the music changes and they share a very special moment where the kid finally feels validated.  Suddenly whatever he suffered is okay because his father approves him and thus he knows he has done good and can be at peace with himself.

Sadly that's just not going to happen for liberals.  So everyone can just look forward to those children losing their shit for the foreseeable future.

    <div class="md">God is the human conscience (ability to discern right from wrong). The bibles god (new test) is based on the conscience of the selfless jesus christ, so the god is about kindness and treating others the way you want to be treated. The korans god is based on the conscience of the sociopath mohammed, so the god is all about submitting to it, and blindly following it without question. Whether the writers of the bible and koran knew it or not, their gods are just interpretations of human conscience. Human conscience is what seperates us from wild animals, and is the catalyst for free will/choice. Choice between doing whats right/good/honorable vs doing whats wrong/evil/dishonorable vs doing neither. Choice is what makes humanity unique (not intelligence). </div>

    <div class="md">I would disagree.  The Bible discuss 2 main gods (Yes, Christians I know there are 3.)  God the father and God the son.  God the father is wrathful and God the son is forgiving.  

Mohammed changed dramatically as he got older.  He started off somewhat strange and as he became a successful warlord he became more aggressive in his stance.       

There is no human conscience as a collective as each culture brings their own values to the table.  Christianity spread the sanctity of life to the west but the middle east and many other areas of the world do not share such a belief.  Human life simply doesn't have great value in most parts of the world.  That's why they can slaughter each other and enslave one another with such disregard.  That's why a woman's life is not valued as strongly as a man's.

This is overwhelming proof that there is no collective conscience.  That's just something you have convinced yourself of because you probably want to believe people are "good", but you are wrong.  People are just people and their culture influences their behaviors.  

I do believe that some people may have shared similar values to your own when they created the Bible as the Bible is a collection of stories.  People told each other stories to pass on knowledge long before things were written down.  Then they believe in gods to create a father figure who will look down on you and punish you if you do not comply with the lesson of said story.

Where your human conscience theory again gets destroyed is when we compare the Koran to the Bible.  These texts have dramatically different views of what good and evil is.  The Bible teaches you to forgive your enemies and turn the other cheek.  The Koran demands complete obedience and Heaven is not something that is just given to you... you must earn it and one of the easiest ways to earn it is to kill the infidels.  

So really your intelligence is what separates you from animals.  It's cute that you think conscience (heart) is what separates you, but we can see many examples in nature where animals show great concern for their offspring.  Also, you even mentioned this, sociopaths and to a much greater degree... psychopaths are living proof that conscience is not a requirement of humanity.      

Your brain is the most sophisticated thing in the known Universe.  It seems emotional that you would dismiss it in favor of feelings.  </div>

    <div class="md">Christianity has one god. The Father(god), son(jc), and holy spirit(possibly another interpretation of human conscience). Notice how the civilizations that embraced a religion with a defined right/good as nuturing life and spirit and a defined wrong/evil as destroying life and spirit prospered tremendously more than civilizations that embraced a religion that did the opposite. The most successful civilizations ever to exist followed Christianity, polytheism (greeks, romans, egyptians), or Buddhism all of which define right/good from wrong/evil. While civilizations that have never prospered and have never contributed anything remotely beneficial to humanity are islam, satanism, and nihilism all of which teach that universally evil things are actually good (like rape, murder and pedophilia) and universally good things are actually bad (like free will, freedom, free thought). My point is that conscience was a step in evolution that brought us prosperous human civilizations. 
  
Your confusing conscious(self awareness) with conscience(ability to discern right from wrong) i think. "People told similar stories before written records"(or whatever you said im on mobile and cant see). Where did they get the idea for the stories then? They unknowingly (or maybe knowingly) came up with the stories in order to better explain what they interpreted to be right and what they interpreted to be wrong, aka conscience.  
  
What makes us unique is not intelligence but conscience. Intelligence still binds the mind to a cage of probabilities towards a set purpose. For example a computer ai exponentially faster than the human brain in all aspects of thought would still be bound to probabilities in carrying out the most beneficial sequence of actions for whatever purpose it perceives to be important (genetic algorithms), while a human can do things because fuck it why not. Why is that? The reason is free will. Free will is the ability to CHOOSE what we deem right and wrong and neither, aka the conscience. Conscience is not an emotion, its something else (which is why so many religions are really just humans trying to explain this phenomenon unknowingly or not).  
  
A perfect example of what makes humans unique is in the matrix 3:  
Agent Smith: Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why, why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting... for something? For more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is? Do you even know? Is it freedom? Or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself, although... only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep fighting. Why, Mr. Anderson? Why? Why do you persist?  
Neo: Because I choose to...  
  
Further proof is the way in which the left works. Ever wonder why liberal media shits on christianity and nuclear families? Ever wonder why the left protects islam despite it seemingly having completely opposite views? Ever wonder why degeneracy is pushed so hard by the left? Ever wonder why the left wants to normalize pedophilia? These things all seem random unless of course the philosophies are all being pushed in order to eliminate humanities ability to choose right from wrong, aka conscience. Which in turn eliminates free will and choice. Humans without free will and choice are slaves/pets/wild animals. In other words the leftist/liberal/progressive/feminist philosophies are tools used to eliminate free will through the destruction of the human conscience in order to enslave the human race to the global elite.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; My point is that conscience was a step in evolution that brought us prosperous human civilizations.

I like where you're going with this, but I don't know if we can call any set of rules an evolutionary step.  It's definitely a positive and productive move.  

&gt; Your confusing conscious(self awareness) with conscience(ability to discern right from wrong) i think. "People told similar stories before written records"(or whatever you said im on mobile and cant see). Where did they get the idea for the stories then? They unknowingly (or maybe knowingly) came up with the stories in order to better explain what they interpreted to be right and what they interpreted to be wrong, aka conscience.

I meant to use conscience.  It's understandable that people like to believe they are inherently good, but good is an objective term.  Say my family and I were starving in India and I found a cow and slaughtered it for food.  To my family I would be good because I provided food, but to Indians I would be evil because I killed a sacred animal.  (At least I think it's sacred.)  

That's why we call ourselves "the people" because people are associated with good.  Those outside our tribe are called "others" etc because they are not the people and therefore a possible threat.  We associate ourselves as good, but outsiders as possibly bad.    

People told each other stories, and still do, as a way of passing on knowledge.  Philosophy likes to cover this in great detail.  Moral stories are very popular to tell because they teach people to treat each other well instead of submitting to their more primitive emotions, like anger, and destroying each other.  Humanity has a very long history of warring with one another over resources and those instincts are very much alive in today's society.  "Punch a nazi" is a good example of people submitting to anger rather than discourse.      

Just about every Disney movie is based on some old story mankind have been telling each other for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

&gt; What makes us unique is not intelligence but conscience.

I get the feeling free will is going to be associated with positive behavior, but what if I told you your actual free will is limited?  Most of what you do in life is due to learned behaviors.  The whole religion thing is proof of this.  You learn that life outside your tribe is valuable.  That's not something you inherently know.

If your mind functioned off of conscience without intelligence you would be a very primitive creature.  You would be driven by emotions and instincts alone.  Mankind has already told the story of how this bad in several ways.  Perhaps this will be familiar to you.  Think with your mind and not with your heart.  To think with your heart is to think with your conscience and to be impulsive.  To think with your mind is to use your intelligence and often your intelligence prevents you from making rash decisions.

I've been known to purposefully attempt to emotionally compromised others in debate for the simple fact that once a person becomes emotionally compromised... they stop thinking rationally and they start making mistakes driven by their emotional minds.  This is your conscience overriding your intelligence.  No matter how intelligent a person is... once they become emotionally compromised I can manipulate them very easily because they stopped thinking with their brain and started thinking with their feelings.   

The struggle to survive is what drives a person forward.  I don't believe it's a matter of free will.  The drowning man syndrome is proof of that.  I understand it's a hard concept to swallow, but you don't have the free will you think you do.  You're just saying these things because you're comfortable right now.  Let me take away your creature comforts.  Let me make you hungry or angry over a period of time and your personality will dramatically change.  Your morals you think to be the foundation of your being will collapse and you will become someone entirely different.  

Many soldiers suffer PTSD during war time and one of the reasons is prolonged exposure to fear and anger cause a person to change.  You become something much different and your brain changes in these ways to adapt you to survive your circumstances.  Then people come home and return to their old morals and have to look in the mirror and realize what a monster they were during war.  People struggle with that because they thought, like you, they were conscious creatures with good morals, but look at the horrible things they did.  They find themselves overwhelmed because they know they did something terrible yet cannot justify it to themselves.  They can't distinguish the fact there is a difference between the mind at peace and the mind at war.  Thus they cannot forgive themselves.

I don't wonder why the left is crazy.  I understand they gave up on rationality and went straight to emotionally driven fallacies and identity politics.  Don't claim to know why, but you may be right.  I don't know.  Their desire for world domination seems reasonable.    

I do know this.  Anyone could be made into a monster.  Some mindsets are quicker to fall inline than others, but anyone can be made into a monster.  People who understand what they really are tend to swim in the shallows of their being because they know what lies in the depths of their abyss.           

I know I am capable of terrible things.  I know I am capable of becoming a Nazi or any sort of ruthless killer.  I understand that the moment all these creature comforts disappear and desperation sinks in... my mindset will change I will become what I must to survive.  But since I know this I also know what to look out for and be wary of.  I know how to identify these traits in others and I know when to look out for these traits in myself.

Why did you remove these comments?

Is it because they disproved the narrative you were trying to create in [this post](http://imgur.com/a/AuHte) that you've since deleted?

    <div class="md">I've been noticing the trend of my former peers caring about facts and objective truth being replaced with caring about opinions and creatively worded articles to support their feelings. It's scary because they're all now advocating for punching nazis and have since changed to calling me a nazi. I've pretty much always had the same views/principles (everyone should leave everyone alone and the only time we should force someone to do/not do something is if it is OBJECTIVELY harmful to others, which of course has room for debate) and was "their army" on social media to argue their point because I tend to cite facts and show holes in the logic. 

Now, I'm a nazi needing punching. </div>
