 And it has been removed. I received the ban message 16 hours after making that post. I have been posting to this sub frequently for years and never had an issue before. I replied to the ban message with:

&gt;???


&gt;What did I do to deserve a ban, let alone a permanent ban? I have been posting here for years without issue and have never received so much as a warning as far as I can recall. So first offense for whatever I did that I am unaware of, is worthy of a permaban? So confused.

It's been 8 hours and no reply as of yet. I know that isn't too long but last I checked they had a number of mods.

I just reread the rules and now I see the source rule and wonder if it is this that caused it, though a perma ban still seems extreme. I don't recall that being a rule there, maybe it is more new or maybe it was always there and I just forgot, but like I said I have posted there a bunch and never had so much as a warning. I recall interestingasfuck requiring the source of any claim in the title. 

At any rate, if sucks. I have experienced this elsewhere on subreddits I have posted a lot of content to and post often to and all of a sudden bam permaban and so much for that, be it art, pics, videos outrun, ~~whomesole~~, mademesmile, presidentialracememes, politicalhumor or a number of other political subs. Now autos. *Not banned from music or trance but any new posts there appear to be autoremoved, despite having posted to both subs plenty in the past without issue and I get no response back from mods when asking why my posts aren't showing up. My posting behavior has remained pretty consistent and I was posting a lot even back then when my posts were accepted. Makes you wonder.



And I wonder what brings it on, hall monitors or someone else wanting to see users punished and restricted from posting or mods paying no mind and giving in to bogus reports and or overreacting. Maybe it's mods arbitrarily enforcing rules with political bias. No idea but I guess it's the thanks users get for participating and contributing to subs which helps the community grow.</div>
