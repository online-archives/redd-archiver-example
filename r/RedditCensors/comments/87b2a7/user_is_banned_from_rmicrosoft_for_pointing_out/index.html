    <div class="md">What if he is wrong on both counts? The title is misleading, and failure to maintain a balanced account is telling - his actions indicate a lack of caring about Reddit rules.

His understanding of the TOS or their changes over time is also false and misrepresents reality.

&gt;5. In the Code of Conduct section, we’ve clarified that use of offensive language and fraudulent activity is prohibited. We’ve also clarified that violation of the Code of Conduct through Xbox Services may result in suspensions or bans from participation in Xbox Services, including forfeiture of content licenses, Xbox Gold Membership time, and Microsoft account balances associated with the account.

and 

&gt;When investigating alleged violations of these Terms, Microsoft reserves the right to review Your Content in order to resolve the issue.

It's right there in the TOS, Ctrl-F it for yourself, there's nothing misleading about quoting Microsoft here.  They ban language and sexy video chat with your partner (a section I didn't quote for you and encourage you to find if you are interested) and admit they will watch your skypes to investigate.  </div>

    <div class="md">No. He isn't spamming anything. The mods know he's not a spammer for the same reason we know that; they looked at the content. If they didn't look, then they're doing a shit job at moderating.

We can all see the article is genuine and it is indeed organic content. Just because he wrote it on his blog and posted a link, rather than writing all the text in a reddit post, doesn't mean he's "spamming." 

But that's my opinion. We're in this subreddit to post where we feel censorship is occurring and discuss/debate it </div>

    <div class="md">Half of that guy's posts are to his personal blog where he asks you to give him money which many would consider spam. Also if you frequent technical related subreddits there is a constant stream of people who do nothing but submit their personal blog articles that either copy content from other sites or post their own poorly made and poorly understood information.

In this case I'd say it's poorly understood and mis-represented. As people have commented in the other subs the guy submitted to, this was already in the old TOS and it's for PUBLIC displays. They aren't going after you for talking naughty to your GF on a private skype call, they're saying you can't use obscene language in public areas which seems fair for a service which caters to children as well as adults.</div>
