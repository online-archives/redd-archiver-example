    <div class="md">It's a bullshit summary if you're arguing for inefficacy. Even the Surgeon General who was citing it backed off. They were only trying to prevent people from hoarding and buying masks in a way that would limit health care providers.

From roughly August on, no one's been citing that study because even *they* know it was bullshit. 

What kind of special do you have to be to put an old shit study about med students in a training/low intensity setting above the real world successes of efforts in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, an much more recent data from *this fucking year?*

If anyone's trying to pretend science only says what they want it to, it's probably the kook waving around an old, unrelated study that has even been called inapplicable by its authors.

Clearly *someone* has never done an actual fucking lit review.</div>

    <div class="md">You seem to have zero scientific or academic ability/education, because what you're doing here is incredibly unscientific and idiotic. 

The ways you're trying to discredit this study are ludicrous. 

&gt;What kind of special do you have to be to put an old shit study about med students in a training/low intensity setting above the real world successes of efforts in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, an much more recent data from this fucking year?

I haven't done that. This study was a single example I gave **in this post**. The full write-up I linked to, and which I was banned for, and which is the topic of this post, has tons more, including recent ones, including a Nature article with commentary from numerous experts. Commentary which criticizes the attitudes of the majority of redditors, including the abusive psychology mods. 

&gt;unrelated study that has even been called inapplicable by its authors

More blatant lies with zero citations. You're disgusting. Exactly the type of person I wrote my full write-up about.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok. You want a real broadside? I'll get back to you.

Masks have efficacy and anyojr saying otherwise is full of shit.

They're not perfect, but any argument that they provide less or equal protection than going unmasked is utter horseshit. 

I'll pick through your trail pile later and rip it apart.</div>
