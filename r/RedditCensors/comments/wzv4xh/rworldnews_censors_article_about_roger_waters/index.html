I search 'Russian hit list' on just worldnews alone and I see many results. How do you explain this hypocrisy?

Edit: if you search Dugin on worldnews, you will see multiple threads with people cheering on this woman (they call fascist) being killed because of her political opinion and I have no love for her or Putin but that is morbid and hypocritical as hell.

The story was also covered here:

https://thegrayzone.com/2022/08/25/roger-waters-ukrainian-govt-hit-list/

And here: 

https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2022/08/25/wwmt-a25.html

And here if you prefer a video:

https://youtu.be/oXJa_1V_4Ys

Edit: I sent a message to mods there 3 days ago just after they removed my post and they never replied to my inquiry. I just now see I got a message from them an hour ago saying I am permanently banned and no reason given. Likely for my post here documenting their censorship and arbitrary rule enforcement. My guess is someone messaged them about this post here in hopes of getting me banned there.

These type of mods are helping to ruin reddit imo (including those who give in to report abuse) and I wonder if admins even give a shit. My guess is they don't care about mod abuse and censorship, perception manipulation via astroturf/brigades and narrative and discourse control with help from mods (especially supermods) and automod with algorithm used to censor, just as long as they uphold the neolib/neocon dem status quo embraced and promoted by Atlantic Council/CIA types. I'd love to be wrong though about the admins.

The abovementioned efforts out political PACS, think tanks etc and their cronies and power hungry dupes in mod positions, is why Reddit looks nothing like it did back in 2010-2012, it doesn't even resemble Reddit pre 2016. It's appears to be a liberal establishment / security state / NATO propaganda board, used to distract, divide and manufacture consent. Change my mind.

They also since removed: 

https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/x1yvb4/roman_ruins_reappear_from_river_in

Without explanation.

And looks like they may have even gone back and removed another post or two I had posted there previously and that were actually upvoted.</div>

Not any moreso than the majority of posts on this sub and that is the title it gave me when sharing the article to reddit.


&gt;If you had actually read and understood the article, you would know that (1) it's just some random website that lists people they don't like, (2) the article itself calls everything rumors, (3) the article itself calls those rumors "debunked", "baseless", or on "shak[y] grounds".

I have read it along with these two articles covering the same topic and I suggest you do as well. I don't think you read the article  or you did and are just being dishonest about what it covers and is saying - it is saying there is truth to this and enough to warrant genuine concern and you just outright dismiss it, I wonder why that is.</div>
