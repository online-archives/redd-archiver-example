    <div class="md">All Canadian city subs are like this. The mod's have lost their damn minds, because the narrative they have been told to craft falls apart at the first sign of inspection. The users, generally, have no idea that the mod's think they are useless shits and can't defend the narrative, so the mod's create these idiotic rules to protect the narrative.

The rule "To make sure you aren't a troll", can be more accurately stated as "To make sure you aren't going to go against the narrative, and cause our users to start thinking for themselves and questioning things"</div>

    <div class="md">Not really when you look at it from their side. I have been around for a LONG time, so let me give you my insight of how they all seem to work .

They spend a lot of time making sure the narrative is true for the masters. I can't speak for vancouver, but for Toronto it has gone something like this:

The mods, all crazed leftists, have worked hard to make sure that the sub is essentially a mirror of opinion from the Star and the CBC. Several users, will actually work for the rags themselves and are tight with the mod's. Whether there is any quid-pro-quo I don't know, but the mod's make sure that the narrative being pushed by those rags gets repeated and repeated in their sub. 

 At first, the M.O of them would be to simply attack any poster that goes against the narrative or pokes holes through it. First they will mass downvote you, this is for two reasons, 1 - get you beneath the limit for being able to freely post(a way of slowing you down from speaking) and 2 - discourage you from speaking such things.

 If you persist in "wrong think" and haven't be discouraged despite having to wait 10 minutes to reply then they would slip to method two. You'd still get downvoted past the viewing limit, but now there will be some people that will actually respond to you and ask you questions about your P.O.V(instead of the name calling during the first step). This is to keep you engaged in the hidden thread, 6 questions to you can keep you busy for a full hour and again hopefully get you discouraged from continuing in the thread because it is just a waste of time. 

Finally, assuming you stayed the course and didn't get discouraged, and continued your "wrong think" ways then you will find some "random poster" that hasn't been involved the entire thread suddenly shows up and gets VERY abusive towards you, name calling, insults, etc all just trying to get you to return  fire. The second you say anything outside of merely being polite to the person calling you every name in the book, the mod(who was the random poster all along) switches accounts claims you have broken rule 3(being civil) bans you and removes the thread to remove the evidence of who it was. If you message the mod afterwards claiming innocence, or that you didn't say anything nearly as bad, or you were defending yourself you will be muted and ignored. 

The problem here is that it didn't stop people from making other alt account's, or new posters coming from other subs, or even just new posters thinking they were in a legitimate discussion. As the mod's cracked down on "wrong think" they pissed more and more people off and had to do the above more and more and it become blatantly obvious the entire process, not to mention the process took a long time which exposed the mod's alt account to others. So they went to the newer version of it.. 

 The new version is to just filter all new users. If your first couple of posts are in agreement with the narrative - the filter gets lifted and away you go.

 If not, then the filter remains. If you inquire why your posts are stuck at 1 and you can't see them when not logged in, they will either tell you what they did(you have to stay in filter purgatory until you give up and go away) or they will then claim you are avoiding a ban and ban you immediately for it. If you try and discuss with them, or defend yourself or prove they are wrong, or ask for any evidence of their claims they will mute you for 72 hours... 

Sorry for the long post, but the amount of censorship that happens on reddit isn't something that can be explained in a couple of lines. 

Also sorry that you got banned, but really there was little lost on your side. MetaCanada is the only real Canadian sub anyway even if the mods there canbe shits, they are at least honest shits which is more than I can say for the other subs.</div>

    <div class="md">This is true. It is important t to keep in mind that just because the sub is called r/Alberta or r/whatevercanadiancity, doesn't mean it's an official representation of anything. All it means is some dipshit thought of making the sub first, and they are always predominantly liberal as reddit is. I'm a centrist and sympathize with a lot of liberal points aside from the fact that they need to control public opinion to the point of censorship and not being able to even consider anything aside from their own opinion. Anyways I digress. The point is official city subreddits are usually garbage to push a political POV</div>

    <div class="md">Sorry to hear that, but what did I tell ya? 

They got the NPC moniker because they are so entirely predictable. 

Not that I am suggesting you break the rules or anything, but it seems to me that when one side flouts the rules, makes them up on the spot and biasly enforces them - that means there are no rules, and there is absolutely not a single reason any user on this platform should give a rats ass about what the mod's say, or the admins, or anyone... I couldn't blame anyone from making dozens of alts, using proxy's, spamming the fuck out of whatever subreddit, heck - if the admins allow AHS to post child porn to subreddit to try and get them shutdown(The reason why WRD is so fucked) then it is clear that anything goes and I see no reason why it shouldn't be dealt back to them. 

If someone wanted to fight you and you both agreed to boxing rules, and then the person kicked you between the legs, you wouldn't continue merely boxing would you? Of course not, you'd stomp them in the grapes as much as you could for payback. I see no difference here.</div>

    <div class="md">I think what's going on is that they are censoring voices skeptical of the lockdown. And the way they're doing this is they don't allow any new posters. But the way they talked to me was pretty rude. A few weeks ago there were some articles on there that were posted that were - intelligently and respectfully - skeptical of the lockdown. But I don't see any now.

I wasn't banned for doing this, I just posted something about a local best buy. But I noticed it wasn't getting any activity. 

So they are shadow banning is what they are doing. I think that's wrong and very unfair. And maybe dangerous.</div>

    <div class="md">All that should matter as regards participation in 'area' subreddits is whether you reside in that area or not. No other determining factor is logical, and no justification whatever can be made for preventing, say, a resident of Vancouver who has yet to contravene Reddit's site rules (as demonstrated by the fact his account is extant) from using the subreddit of his area of residence.   

Consider it a corollary to the factor determining suitable content (i.e. does it pertain to the area in question or not). Let us say you *are* a troll: assuming this website allows trolls (and that you are still using it is proof), if you are a troll from Vancouver making posts about Vancouver, what possible argument can be made for (shadow)banning you from the Vancouver subreddit? The onus ought correctly to be on someone to make, say, VancouverNoTrolling, or SeriousVancouver for such niche purposes.

Given that Reddit admins are no longer practising such a 'hands-off' approach to the website as in the past, such protections as this are the least they can grant their users - it hardly behoves them to have the 'front page of the Internet' have subforums ostensibly concerning a given residential area in actuality being fiefdoms accepting only such content and posters as pleases a minute cadre of moderators (who are never so obliging as to outline their capricious rules such that they can be followed).</div>
