Wife and I did a Johnson Protest vote and now we think Trump actually did a pretty good job and find it silly how much the Democratic party just cries.

    <div class="md">Try testing the comment in an old r/politics thread. If it gets removed right away, then you're hitting some filter. (Things that start out "You're" often hit it, such as "You're evil".) If that's the case, try posting paragraph by paragraph and see which ones get removed.

    <div class="md">That means the sub also isn't counting your downvotes (even though reddit is pretending otherwise). What you might have to do (if you care) is bite the bullet and say something pandering about Bernie Sanders to get you positive upvotes. Once you're in the positives, the time filter (and secret negative vote filter) is lifted.

Or just use an alt to get an upvote on whatever and then test the filter with that account.</div>

    <div class="md">It's the equivalent of someone who can't take no for an answer.

Our country can't and won't fall apart with one bad president - we've already survived for hundreds of years.

People were screaming "doomsday!" as soon as Trump was elected... I spent the first year trying to explain that it's okay and that if our democracy was so easily destroyed it would've happened already.

I figured it would taper off after that, but it simply never did.

They were literally talking about impeaching him [BEFORE HE WAS EVEN THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE](https://www.politico.eu/article/could-donald-trump-be-impeached-shortly-after-he-takes-office-us-presidential-election-2016-american-president-impeachment/).

^ you can't even make this up.

&gt;Could Trump be impeached shortly after he takes office? Donald Trump isn’t even the Republican nominee yet. But his incendiary rhetoric, most notably about killing the families of terrorists and bringing back torture, has critics on the right and the left discussing the most extreme of countermeasures at an unusually early point in the race.</div>

    <div class="md">♥️ I don't agree with everything on either side, but it seems like we have to follow the policies that are the least bad.

Unfortunately I think the democratic party has gone off the rails as of late.

The Republican party is certainly saying some stupid b.s. occasionally, but nothing like the left IMO.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm exactly where you are, always have been pretty left leaning, I never really considered myself a Democrat, more of an independent, but I would choose dems over Republicans any day of the week. Hell I was all on the Trump hate train during the election.  Now I cannot bring myself to support the DNC, they have outed themselves as corrupt, vindictive, lying, anti american, anti constitutional bullies and I see that Trump is actually not that bad. 2020 is the first time in my life I will vote for a Republican, though I don't really see Trump as a true Republican, he is pretty liberal and has brought the republicans a bit closer to the left imo on a ton of issues. I think there are many people like me, and many of us chose to stay silent irl because of all the hate that we'd get. I checked that site that shows everyone who donated to Trump (I think its http//racist.watch) and so many in my highly liberal area have donated. So unless the DNC straight up manipulates votes and stuffs ballot boxes, or the economy tanks hard in the next year, I don't see how Trump is not going to get reelected.</div>

    <div class="md">Yea you are full of shit.

Trump isn't that bad? Obstructing an investigation into a foreign nation attacking our elections isn't bad?

His campaign manager giving polling data to the Russians on 3 states he won by 18k votes total isn't bad?

Violating the emoluments clause to use the office of presidency to enrich himself isn't bad?

Using congressional aid as leverage to gain a political advantage isn't bad?

Having his personal lawyer meet with foreign governments bypassing government protocols isn't bad?

Alienating our western allies while cozying up to eastern authoritarians isn't bad?

Allowing Erdogans body guards to assault US citizens on US soil isn't bad?

Allowing SA to brutally murder an American resident isn't bad?

Scolding his security for not beating a protestor isn't bad?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm in a ton of pain recovering from surgery so I don't really have the strength nor desire to go over everything right now and Im a little all over the place but most of what you say is twisted or seen from a different angle. For example, how did he allow SA to kill anyone? He obstructed an investigation into himself that was fraudulent by simply not cooperating.  I don't know what you're talking about as far as allowing Erdogas  bodyguards to assault a US citizen. I don't believe that he violated the emoluments clause and I also don't believe that he did anything wrong in regards to asking Ukraine to investigate Burisma, There's absolutely no evidence of wrong doing on that part.</div>

    <div class="md">Has he though? One of the biggest selling points for Trump in the midwest/rustbelt was the revival of the Manufacturing Core in the United States. I am not sure how closely you follow economics, but the US Manufacturing industry has gone from Weak and Fragile under Bush and Obama, to being on it's death bed under Trump. 

Regardless of where you stand politically, US Manufacturing is not coming back. We've seen [stagnant manufacturing growth in 2018; This year we are actually seeing contraction in the Manufacturing Industry.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/business-confidence) We are two months away from an [official Manufacturing Recession](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/the-manufacturing-sector-just-fell-deeper-into-recession-ism-pmi-2019-12-1028730787), which by definition is six consecutive months of a economic decline in domestic manufacturing.

So who has benefited most from Trumps fiscal policies? For the most part, large international corporations [that were able to bring in foreign profits from overseas with minimal tax burdens.](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-12-19/companies-repatriate-1-trillion-since-tax-overhaul) I think Trump will lose the Midwest and Rust Belt swing states in 2020 for this reason, and that might be enough for him to lose the 2020 election.

Edit: That moment this subreddit downvotes hard facts because it doesn't fit their narrative. That's a yikes from me dawg.</div>

    <div class="md">All I know is that jobs are plenty, we have record low unemployment and regular people, on average are making more than they were before. The economy in general is doing great and I belive that Trump is trying to get some of those manufacturing jobs back, hence the trade war with China, though I'll admit I don't know much about it and honestly with AI becoming more prominent we should probably look at alternative solutions to this problem. I would say outsourcing our labor and manufacturing as little as possible is a good step though, and I was under the impression that Trump was working towards that goal. At the very least, by getting rid of needless, business killing regulations he has helped reinvigorate the job market and our economy.

I don't think he is our greatest president, but considering the alternatives he is the best we've got and I'm happy to cast my vote for him if it's going to he between him and any of the DNC front runners.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Using congressional aid as leverage to gain a political advantage isn't bad?

This is exactly what Biden did (and for more money).

Trump asked about it and apparently that's unacceptable.

The Ukraine leaders supported Trump in this too which is quite telling.

They could have easily said "yeah he tried to pressure us" but they didn't.</div>

    <div class="md">Bro lookup the democratic socialist convention for some comedy gold. 

Most of reddit spends their time whining and crying about "the rich."

It's easy to look up and lose gratitude - that's what's happened.

Quite a few college aged kids aren't proud to be Americans anymore. 

Most of the same kids think America is super racist randomly too.

This rhetoric is so damaging and completely untrue.</div>
