      <div class="md">Recently even one of Reddit's founders, Steve Huffman wrote an announcement complaining [about Reddit's alleged Russian bot/troll problem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/) After [examining some of the sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/dvb8uhs/) of the pro-Hillary, American Democratic whiners that keep this myth alive, I found that the allegedly powerful Internet Research Agency of Russia with its puny $1.25 million monthly budget [is directed toward domestic and international audiences](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) and thus even all that small million dollar sum wasn't directed to interfering in the 2016 American election. Meanwhile [the Clinton campaign spent $1.2 billion and the Trump campaign $612 million](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-russian-interference-affect-the-2016-election/), so by comparison even if Russia invested $1.25 million solely into the American election, it still wouldn't influence much. Infact on Reddit the only thing I have noticied time and again is that on almost every subreddit if you don't simply circlejerk against Russia and support the media war mongering against Russia, it will be bad for your karma and ["because having higher karma is desired, users behave in ways that will get them karma"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130214071406/http://jeffdechambeau.com/redditing-to-the-mean.html), which in this case involves bashing Russia. In my real life workplace and day to day conversation there is no concern for finding a Russian under everyone's bed contrary to this internet political discussion furor. 

All that Russia misdirection has allowed the arguable largest national vote brigading and botting group to get far, far less attention than they deserve: the Turkish brigaders, trolls and botfarms. In thread after thread I noticie the top voted comments are mostly Turks having a monologue with other Turks, it is a surreal and pathetic scene:   

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/85a3q3/turkishbacked_forces_have_taken_full_control_of/

https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/83lvb0/turkish_mosque_attack_with_molotov_cocktails_in/

Practially all of /r/syriancivilwar(a really shitty ultra-censoring sub full of mostly nerds thousands of miles away) and /r/combatfootage is a never ending Turkish state propaganda wankfest ever since Turkey invasion of Afrin dubbed with the Orwellian title "Operation Olive Branch" started. 

Have Russia/Russians ever been able to turn /r/worldnews, /r/europe into circlejerks of their state's official talking points as much? Russia may have a weak and tentative state social media program, but the actual Russian population is not fanatic to turn into millions of footsoldiers for the program. Russia also cannot get 20,000-40,000 people in Germany to attend a Putin rally, but [the fanatic Turkish diaspora can turn out those numbers when Erdogan visits the Turkish immigrant colonists of Germany](http://www.dw.com/en/erdogan-demos-and-counterprotests-put-cologne-on-edge/a-19440544) who have no intention of assimilating. Turkey has a state social media program and the ultra-nationalist population to back it up. To give an idea of how fanatic the Turkish population is, watch this old AKP election video titled [Millet Eğilmez.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80J0FCe69to) A [text description by the anthropologist Jenny White](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/02/02/the-turkish-complex/) who focuses on Turkey:  

&gt;The AKP video for the 2014 local election showed a mysterious stranger in a foreign-looking trench coat cutting the rope that held up an enormous Turkish flag. As the falling flag’s ominous shadow floated across the land, citizens of every persuasion began to run toward the flagpole, masses of them diving into the Bosphorus to swim to the flag’s rescue. In a chilling special-effects ending, citizens swarm on top of each other to create an enormous cone-shaped hive, seen from the sky. One young man, his face aglow with fervor, climbs on the backs of the others to the top of the pile and grabs the broken end of the rope, flinging himself outward to certain death while pulling the flag back up.

That election video presented the Turkish population as a fanatic zombie like mass or Zerg herd(Starcraft) and it actually worked, in Turkey. While in Western societies it would have backfired for insulting the nation as a fanatic, dumb mass. But Turks are proud to be a fanatic, ignorant, ultra-nationalist, bloothirsty mob so it worked! And that is also why the Turkish state's social media efforts are much more effective and potent on Reddit than Russia's or those of other nations. Turkey has massively insulted almost every country with its diplomacy and engaged in patently hostile actions in an official matter against almost every Western country that matters, and yet on a Western dominated medium like Reddit, Turkish brigaders, trolls and bots are amazingly able to bully their positions through again and again. Here is just a small fraction of the articles about the Turkish state's inverventions on the internet:

Time and time again, whenever I try to counter Turkish propaganda on Reddit my posts are deleted and very funny activities happen with voting: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7x8ea2/rturkey_captured_flag_of_greekgreek_cypriot/

(I would cite more but even ceddit is not indexing a lot of the deletions...)

Recently I had an accidental hint at what is really happening behind the scenes. A while ago I read a great article about [the Turkish embassy in Belgium being the source of threats to journalists in that country(https://stockholmcf.org/turkish-embassy-turns-out-to-be-source-of-threats-sent-to-journalists-in-belgium/)(mostly Turkish ones) and [posted it to /r/belgium.](https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/7tgohb/turkish_embassy_turns_out_to_be_source_of_threats/) It seemed to be very welcomed by the actual userbase there, infact if you check the related discussion tab, after I posted that article on their own several people who frequent that sub reposted the same article to other subs. I checked the post history of one of the Erdogan shills on that thread and got a brief glimpse at what is the real power of Turkish partisans, of Reddit, they don't care about free speech in any sense and are willing to censor their oponnents. I found that an Islamist Kosovo Albanian "Ottoman seed leftover" and self proclaimed Erogan fan created a thread to not only censor that thread but to get mods to filter the media source I posted in the future! 

&gt;[/r/belgiummeta: Turkish embassy ](https://www.reddit.com/r/belgiummeta/comments/7tm8tb/turkish_embassy/)

&gt;Dear mods,

&gt;I urge you to check the source of that post, and ponder whether such propaganda could not be considered 'haat zaaien' when paired with the message it delivers concerning a large portion of the migrant population of the country this subreddit represents.

&gt;This is nothing more than slander en masse.

And as usual on Reddit the useless waste of space mods instead of defending free speech, instead felt powerful and haughty at being presented yet another chance to abritrate what information we should or should not be able to access since they already accidently stumbled on internet power and authority that most of them anyway shouldn't have:   

&gt;The source of that post seems to be a propaganda outlet, yeah. I'll start up a discussion with the other mods whether or not we should start filtering out such content - same with the Gatestone Institute article posted earlier.

&gt;Most users on r/belgium seem to be critical enough to spot propaganda when they see it, but it's still annoying.

If you go on that meta thread you will be greeted with the familiar [deleted] seen all over on Reddit... On [Youtube biased Tyrone posted a hilarious critique of 4chan janitors(which is their term for mods)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdC_Cu9X4wc) that applies equally well to Reddit mods: 

&gt;He is a janitor on the internet, on an anime image board. He does it for free. He takes his job very seriously. He does because it is the only amount of power and control he will ever have in his pathetic life. He deletes threads he doesn't like, because whenever he gets upset he has an asthma attack. He deletes threads he doesn't like because they interfer with the large backlog of inter-Chinese girl cartoons he still has to watch. He will never have a real job. He will never move out of his parent's house. He will never be at a healthy weight. He will never know how to cook anything besides a Hot Pocket[American microwaveable sandwhich pocket]. He will never have a girlfriend. He will never have any friends. ...

Indeed the German Marshall Fund recently published the results of shocking study that shows how rooted the Turkish penchant for totalitarianism against the Turkish political party that Turkish citizens feel most distant to is:  

&gt;[German Marshall Fund: Dimensions of Polarization in Turkey](http://www.gmfus.org/publications/dimensions-polarization-turkey)

&gt;About half of the respondents supported wiretapping the phones of supporters of the “other party,” and 37 percent said they are against participation of the members of this group in elections.

In my experience most Reddit mods are the social losers of the West and should not even hold the internet authority they do. So when Turks massively complain and report posts instead of that making them angry at Turkish attempts of censorship and instead of them taking action against constantly reporting whiners turning Reddit into a shithole of threads full of the word [deleted], they instead feel an ego boost as the Turkish complaints recognize their authority to delete material! Indeed there is even some Greek loser neckbeard mod that only posts mostly about vidya games and to janitor on /r/europe, /u/greekball who [frequently reports my posts again and again with the goal of getting me banned from Reddit subs and Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7vcapb/here_lies_the_patriots_hopes_and_dreams_for_super/dts2u14/) In the glory days of the pre-Reddit internet during the "phpbb era" on the better forums such whiners would be looked at as vermin but those cowards are the probably the secret to why Reddit discussion after discussion is full of [deleted] comment chains.  

Now I cannot prove that appealing to the vanity and authority of Reddit's neckbeard mods is why Turkish vote brigaders are so successful on Reddit, but it is a start. 

**Why do you guys think the Turks are able to bias Reddit so easily?** 

Aside:      
Isn't pathetic /u/kn0thing suppossed to be half-Armenian, shouldn't he be concerned that the nation that committed and denies the Armenian genocide is so easily able to game Reddit again and again? Instead of talking about that publicly, Reddit is co-operating with the Western mainstream media in looking for a Russian under everyone's bed... I have yet to found a Russian there despite what the corporate controlled media war-mongers write.

    <div class="md">Gee, I wonder how I wake up and there are 23 replies to my posts, almost all of them in this thread, almost all of them by Turks and your hideous hulog hulog comment accusing others of racism when racism is a normalized value in Turkey, got a massive 43 points! During the Afrin invasion Turkish troops, probably mostly Bordo berelis who are literally recruited from ultra-nationalist/Islamist Grey Wolf fascists were taking photos all over the place with Grey Wolf hand signs and making Pan-turanist graffiti. Turkey is a society like if the NDSAP of Germany were lionized and normalized or if the KKK of the USA were normalized.

Thanks for proving my point how Turks massively vote brigade threads. </div>

    <div class="md">I used to think it was that Turks were leveraging irc/slack/discord to massively swarm and gain local superiority. But a /r/syriancivilwar mod who noticed funny voting patterns complained to admins and posted that there were turkish vote bots and turkish report bots activated on that sub and targeted users:   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/85jilt/reddits_massive_turkish_vote_brigade_problem/dw79v3j/

Obviously a vote bot was released in this thread too. I am complaining to a mod here and gonna ask him to complain to an admin on my behalf. 

And you Turks don't know what racism is. Turkish ethos is that Turks cannot possibly be racist and imperialist, even when that is what they are being:   

&gt;http://koreaofmideast.blogspot.com/2016/11/turks-cannot-be-imperialist-it-is.html

Turkish state policies and popular opinion are massively racist. Turks make white America seem unracist.

    <div class="md">Now I will make a few things clear, before I make a general reply:

I am a turk and no I am neither active in this subreddit, nor did I downvote/upvote anything here. 

Now to your "concern":

You pick topics that are related to Turkey and you are suprised, why so many turks upvote/downvote on posts that are related to Turkey? This makes no sense at all. We are all biased regarding specific topics and obviously turks on turkish related topics will upvote pro-turkish posts, while downvote anti-turkish posts. Is this right? I don´t think so. Is this biased? Sure, however we are all doing this. 

Is this however a problem? No. Why should that be the case? It is just downvoted/upvoted. It is not like it is censored. Your entire "concern" feels just like a huge exaggeration to circle-jerk on turks and nothing more. Just to take one example on why you are just racist:

    <div class="md">tl:dr;

Like the Western corporate, mainstream media Reddit too is obsessed with a "Russian under every bed." Despite the hysteria, I don't notice Russian viewpoints getting any traction on this medium, what I notice instead is Turkish vote brigaders, trolls, etc., strong-arming over and over again viewpoints that are not popular in the West, but that are instead the official arguments of [the Turkish bandit state.](http://koreaofmideast.blogspot.com/2013/03/turkey-bandit-state.html) I posit that part of the eery success of Turkish viewpoints on Reddit is due to the censoring stance Reddit Turks jibbing well with the vanity or Reddit's ultra-nerd moderators. Turks have to be massively using the report/snitch function of Reddit as even the German Marshall Fund indicates more than 1/3rd of Turks think the supporters of the Turkish political party they hate the most shouldn't be allowed to vote.  Instead of defending free speech, Reddit's cancerous neckbeard mods feel empowered by the constant Turkish reports to censor comments and ban users and the excuse to otherwise perform moderator actions. So rather than take action against the censorship loving, whining Turks, the mods do the opposite again and again. This deficiency of Reddit moderating culture combines with the fanatic ultra-nationalism of Turks, and the official trolling/botnet efforts of the Turkish state, so that Turkish viewpoints that are really abhorred in our societies are able to again and again gain massive traction on the [fake frontpage of the internet.](https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddit-is-not-the-front-page-of-the-internet) </div>

    <div class="md">Seppos? What is that? 

Also if it was up to most American citizens Turkey would be sanctioned by now. If it was up to Congress and the Senate, Turkey would be sanctioned by now. The State Department stepped in with its extreme support of realpolitik to save the Turkish bandit state for now. But eventually the Turkish governments' constant outbursts will create enough momentum for sanctions against Turkey and eventual expulsion from NATO. Already now most American think-tanks, pundits and policy analysts are starting to say Turkey should be removed from NATO. Sanctions for some Turkish banks will probably happen for the illegal Reza Zarrab gold trading with Iran that kept the teetering Turkish economy afloat, shoring up their trade deficit. </div>

    <div class="md">Aussie slang for ‘Americans’. I don’t get how you can break the law and get in trouble “next time” though. 

I was angry myself that Americans would be harmed on American soil by foreign powers. I simply can’t imagine the outrage Americans must have felt and how it didn’t force the hand of higher powers into action. Particularly because of how free speech is so fiercely protected in the states (something Australians are not permitted..kinda).</div>

Can you tell your government to do that? Ban Reddit. It would be a good solution for us gavur/infidels for the Turkish infestation problem. Reddit doesn't need ISIS/Al Qaeda supporters, most of whom pretend to be secular, in addition to all its other problems. </div>

    <div class="md">I used [Reddit comment search](https://redditcommentsearch.com/) and found a trove of info in the posts of the mod of /r/syriancivilwar /u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof  that shows there is heavy Turkish botting activity on Reddit:   

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwue7f    

&gt;Absolutely there are regular users here. But bot karma gets reversed. My comments in the last few hours have not all been upvoted 30+ times. That's bot karma. This thread? It was at 12% upvoted at one point. Now it's on the front page. Every single comment on this thread, regardless of opinion or support, was below -15.

&gt;...

&gt;I'm calling bots because I've spoken with reddit admins and they've confirmed there are bots in use. I will repeat from my previous comment. All comments in a thread do not drop below the comment threshold without botting. Comments on this sub do not gain 40 points in an hour. When all my comments (even on other subreddits) go down to -20 at the same time, that's not regular people. You don't see karma scores, the mod team can.

And: 

&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwtg47

&gt;Point me to one instance when a Kurd used bots to downvote entire threads to -30. Just one. You won’t be able to. I hate talking like this, and the other mods can testify, but there is absolutely no comparison to what has happened to the sub in the past two months. There had been huge vote brigading on this sub. When a propaganda picture of some random special forces soldier gets to 120 points in three hours, but YPG ATGM videos are never getting past 65% upvotes. There’s a problem. ...

&gt;I have never seen brigading as blatant and obvious as with what has happened in the last few months. There are bots assigned to downvote posts from pro-YPG sources instantly. There are bots assigned to several pro-Turkish users (who are longtime good and civil contributors) that upvote their stuff automatically. There are tons of reports every day that are extremely racist against Kurds. People like u/dodo91 had bots attached to his account downvoting literally every comment to ~-40. u/HenryPuot had (and probably still has) a report bot attached to his account. There is a concentrated level of trolling on this sub that hasn’t been seen since the Russian intervention. The pro-Kurdish circlejerk could get bad at times, yes. But we never had them mass-reporting things they didn’t like in attempts to get people banned outside of a few exceptions I can count on one hand. We never had bot armies downvoting posts they didn’t like so they never reached the front page. We never had dozens of alt accounts constantly send harassing messages to pro-Turkish users. We never had numerous posts of goreposting memes from them.

&gt;I hate that I have to even explain this. It is completely evident what is causing problems on this sub.

&gt;...

And:   
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwl4n6  

&gt;Yeah the admins can see who does the downvoting and they ban those accounts. Sometimes they IP ban, though the users get around it easy, most in Turkey already have VPNs. But there's a lot of bots. At least 30 are in use right now. There's also report brigading going on.   

And: 
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwkhs9  

&gt;Normal users? No. But with bots yes. Remember, every user banned can't upvote or downvote. The admins were quick to act just an hour ago when I got some bots. Hopefully the same thing happens here.

And:    
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkish-backed_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their_vehicles_with_looted_goods_a/dvwkapk   
&gt;I agree. This is getting ridiculous. Some comments here are at -20. I've already got one set of bots banned today. God willing more will come now. On the bright side, it gets reversed after like 8 hours.

And:   
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/82gug3/muntasrbillah_brigade_captured_one_black_market_sugar_depot_of_the_ypg_mili/dv9z0y3   

&gt;Heads up. People either have bots assigned to you( /u/flintsparc ) or are downvoting everything on your account. This was at -2 before I approved it.

    <div class="md">I wonder how I wake up and there are 23 replies to my posts, almost all of them in this thread, almost all of them by Turks and see about 9 Turks posting in this thread and all their comments with talking points that only Turks agree with massively upvoted to 40+, 30+, 17 points, etc., which is a huge swing in a few hours for such a tiny subreddit. At first I thought it was because of irc/slackchat/discord but seeing this thread I see that totesmessenger bot informs everyone that this thread was crossposted to many other subs including the den of brigaders, /r/Turkey. Normally in the past I would get such notifications of crossposts to my Reddit inbox, but I think Reddit changed and without the totesmessenger comment I wouldn't have known. 

How do Turks achieve this again and again? **How do they bully talking points that only Turks agree with all the time to be the most upvoted comments, despite living in a generally despised country whose leaders have literally insulted every powerful demographic on Reddit? Does any Turk have the actual honesty to divulge why this happens again and again?**

Here is a comment by a mod in /r/syriancivilwar after I made this thread complaining they have seen Turkish bot action:  

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85d8tm/turkishbacked_syrian_arab_fighters_load_their/dvwk3hq/        
&gt;As everyone can see, there's been an issue with vote manipulation in this thread. It's been sent off to the admins.

&gt;...

&gt;Normal users? No. But with bots yes. Remember, every user banned can't upvote or downvote. The admins were quick to act just an hour ago when I got some bots. Hopefully the same thing happens here.     

A rare Turk even complained publicly on /r/syriancivilwar about the massive Turkish vote brigading:   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/85elv5/a_request_from_mods/

&gt;And I want to tell the Turkish users this:     
&gt;You don't downvote a post because you don't like it. ...

One of the mods there even wrote they know about the massive vote brigading:   

&gt;We have contacted the Reddit admins about the massive brigading. Some of the downvoting seems to have been reversed after a few hours.

A year ago someone complained again in syriancivilwar about the massive Turkish brigades and shenanigans. /u/Pruswa who was a Turkish mod of the sub at the time wrote this a year ago:   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/56grue/question_did_this_subreddit_become_proturkey/d8j6dh6/

&gt;&gt;Wouldnt be surprised if maj. of those accounts belong to the same few users.

&gt;We have concerete evidence to support this, in case you are wondering.

    <div class="md">There was a time when 30+ accounts were banned by admins because they so blatantly used it to spam and remove Kurdish flags during the pixel game that was being held on reddit a while ago. Actually the vote brigading really got quiet after then, but now it's back in force, you can tell.

/r/combatfootage - there is a thread that is ironically specifically talking about turks and their vote-brigading, not mentioning the racist, disgusting comments constantly in that sub they put out. They got rid of all the nasty comments, but obviously the vote-brigading they can only do so much. They sly racist comments and hate is back with a tone of hiding their true nature.

/r/europe is a fest of wannabe European turks who pretend to have western values, act like turkey is some utopia and all the while come up with the vilest shit you can imagine, like pure hatred and racist comments. The vote brigading is there too.

/r/syriancivilwar sub has been fully taken over. It's not even worth mentioning the vile shit they say there. The subject matter brings out the 'best' in them.

I think they are botting, using mass accounts, but it seems like it comes from more of hatred and nationalism then actual government sponsored, however, I may be completely wrong.

Also to add to your last paragraph. They love to impersonate other ethnicities and cultures. They pretend to be Armenians, Kurds, Greeks on a regular basis. It's so obvious that you can tell they are doing it.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah Turks are definitely cancerous ultra-nationalist shitheads with few exceptions. So all their vote brigading and vote bots could mostly be individual efforts divorced from the Turkish state. But it is impossible to say since only admins have the powers to find out and this medium is anti-transparency and admins don't publicize any info about the huge Turkish efforts on Reddit, instead as I complained in this writeup Reddit officially backs up their media and government by whining about Russia's much less effective social media efforts that I and everyone else cannot notice.. The best proof I could scrounge due to this lack of disclosure by admins was a trove of info in the posts by a mod of /r/syriancivilwar, /u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, that shows there is heavy Turkish botting activity on after he asked admins to investigate the funny vote games on that sub:    
https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/85jilt/reddits_massive_turkish_vote_brigade_problem/dw79v3j/

Reddit is a medium that is so easy to game that they are able to massively dominate the discourse despite their country attacking every Western and European nation and generating a lot of bad will. Even the shithead Turkish Redditors just attack everyone as belonging to a PKK supporter nation, amplifying the bad will of Erdogan's mouth. But still on thread after thread I see views only Turks hold bully through despite their disadvantage of belonging to a pariah nation. For example here Turks manage to once again bully through on /r/europe their love for Ataturkmania and a distortion of a German scholar's work:   

https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ah0ic/meanwhile_in_a_bookshop_in_turkey_allah_in_the/dwymsba/

    <div class="md">&gt; Can you link to that thread? 

Sure, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/57owaq/update_downvoting_links_based_on_political/). The mods refrained from addressing the elephant in the room, but around the same time the thread was created there was a huge amount of turkish users posting turkish propaganda videos, downvoting anything kurdish, spreading propaganda. You can also see a question raised by a user with turkish flair, asking the whole issue.

I think you could even PM the mods and nicely ask some history on that thread and why the need to make that clear, or search through the sub comment history and see if you find any mods stating the obvious.

&gt; The best proof I could scrounge due to this lack of disclosure by admins was a trove of info in the posts by a mod of /r/syriancivilwar, /u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, that shows there is heavy Turkish botting activity on after he asked admins to investigate the funny vote games on that sub:

[Here is the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFarLeftSide/comments/62yblc/the_party_parrot_is_now_holding_the_hammer_and/dfpz9xy/) about the 30+ accounts that reddit admins banned, because they were controlled by someone, trying to ruin the YPG flag during the pixel event. This indicates that these suspicious downvotes aren't us being crazy, there is obviously an agenda to warp the view.

I am guessing they have now recreated the number of accounts and I've tracked a few, some were created last year around july to december, a bunch created jan to feb/march. They are acting like normal users, but you can tell.</div>

I have further evidence. [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8eelr3/today_24_april_is_the_armenian_genocide/dxux4pu/) in /r/europe was brigaded recently. Every single comment was downvoted, talking high downvotes. However because it got a lot of attention, the thread blew up and people counter voted the brigading and brought all the comments back. My link highlights a mod and people acknowledging what happened.

EDIT: Someone took a snapshot of what it looked like, before the thread got highly popular.
