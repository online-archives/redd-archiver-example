    <div class="md">There it is man - the people who legitimately care about life are coming out to say, "*Hey dude, people are getting killed during these protests. Maybe we should chill on the violence and get back to the peace?*"

Which of course is a bunch of people screaming "Not all protesters are rioters!" - obviously the same thing as saying "Not all police officers are racist and evil," but somehow these facts get lost on leftists.

Not a single person is talking about the black police chief who was killed, the black people who are injured during the ensuing violence, etc.

It bothers me how easily people become the things they claim to oppose - racist and violent... literally perpetuating it.</div>

It's not being wiped. It's being heavily promoted by the right for political reasons and ignored like all of the other black deaths these past few days because structural racism against blacks is still a thing.

A better question is why the right-wing media is ignoring all of the other black deaths at the hands of police AND rioters and only focusing on this one convenient narrative.

BLM doesn't mean one black life matters. It means ALL BLACK LIVES MATTER. The #AllLivesMatter people never understood that. We need to cover the deaths of all black people at the hands of police. Not just one. All black deaths, including at the hands of other black people. Not just when a white person is killed.

When you say all lives matter, do you pick one person like Dorn or all lives?</div>

[You tell me - where's the justice for this guy?](https://abcnews.go.com/US/small-town-police-chief-killed-officers-cities-wounded/story?id=71017820)

Eh, gotta crack a few black eggs to spread violence and racism, right?

We're saying hey - quit burning shit to the ground and get back to a message of peace. If people start rioting, you need to walk away - not run in and loot alongside them; not throw molotov cocktails at occupied police cars.

It's really not that complicated.</div>

    <div class="md">Rioters and looters aren't protesters. You can say you are. They can say they are. But they aren't.

You're gonna have to sort that out in your mind, just as they will.

Anyone who commits violence to protest violence is a hypocrite. 

Aside from that, your comment makes no sense because you're decrying a peaceful form of protest. Why? To make the life hell for the people moderating that sub? It has to be intentionally incendiary. 

If you had any awareness, you'd have said "I understand how that could make your life difficult. I didn't speak well and I wanted a call to more concrete action."

There's so much subtle baiting and trolling right now and your post is either that or you misspoke and should own your mistake to the mods and stop crying to us. Man up and own your shit. Delete this post and go apologise.</div>

    <div class="md">In 2019 police officers fatally shot 1,004 people, most of whom were armed or otherwise dangerous. African-Americans were about a quarter of those killed by cops last year (235), a ratio that has remained stable since 2015. That share of black victims is less than what the black crime rate would predict, since police shootings are a function of how often officers encounter armed and violent suspects. In 2018, the latest year for which such data have been published, African-Americans made up 53% of known homicide offenders in the U.S. and commit about 60% of robberies, though they are 13% of the population.

The police fatally shot nine unarmed blacks and 19 unarmed whites in 2019, according to a Washington Post database, down from 38 and 32, respectively, in 2015. The Post defines “unarmed” broadly to include such cases as a suspect in Newark, N.J., who had a loaded handgun in his car during a police chase. In 2018 there were 7,407 black homicide victims. Assuming a comparable number of victims last year, those nine unarmed black victims of police shootings represent 0.1% of all African-Americans killed in 2019. By contrast, a police officer is 18½ times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer.</div>

    <div class="md">Police shoot more white people than they do any other race. If anything black people should look at other black people because black people kill other black people a hell of a lot more than other races do. According to the Washington post, 2018 had 454 white people and 229 black people shot and killed by police, in 2019 376 white, 236 black, 2020 so far has had 185 whites and 95 blacks. In the past two and a half years 1015 whites and 560 blacks have been shot and killed by police, shouldn’t whites have more of a reason to riot? If we’re talking about without a gun out of those 1015 white people 416 white people had no firearm and 228 black people had no firearm. Now, obviously firearms aren’t the only weapon, but one of the most common and talked about. Talking completely unarmed that’s 25 white and 22 black in 2018, 25 white and 15 black in 2019, and 10 white 6 black this year, overall 60 white and 43 black. Closer than the other categories but still more whites. If police love to target black people so much why are white people the majority killed by police? This isn’t even counting the very few Hispanic, Asian, Indians, etc. killed by cops, if they were racist, white supremacists you would think they’d dislike blacks, Asians, Indians, Hispanics, Latinos, etc. the same, no? Maybe, just hear me out, whites and blacks commit a majority of crime and thus are more likely to be killed by police. Floyd was committing a crime, but he didn’t deserve to die, but you making retarded statements in his name just spits on his grave. All this is from TWP, a rather liberal site by the way, before you try and say shit.</div>

    <div class="md">What about the black, Hispanic, Asian, Indian, Latino,etc. cops? I bet half of the US police force, tried looking it up but it’s all opinion pieces and can’t find a actual statistic or I would. If the police and justice system, why is it majority black and not full of Indians, Hispanics, and other people with darker color to their skin? Maybe black people just commit more crime and thus are imprisoned more often..</div>

    <div class="md">Now you're talking about crime rates. Why did you change the subject? There are many reasons black people commit more crimes than any other race, for sure. But you were addressing only  punishments and the arrest rates. And even rich black people commit more crimes than poor whites. Poverty is not the culprit. If you want to look at family structure, you might start to get some clues.</div>

    <div class="md">You seem to have an open enough mind and you're willing to listen so some facts, so here you go:

Democratic policy incentivized single parent households in black communities. More welfare was given out to single mothers than families that had a father in the home. The result of this is that it became profitable to be a single mother - which, unfortunately, meant that kids were being raised without a father.

Kids being raised without a father do far worse at many, many things - in particular:

&gt;Studies have found that children raised without a father are: At a higher risk of having behavioral problems. Four times more likely to live in poverty. More likely to be incarcerated in their lifetime.

So you may see where this disproportionate amount of black crime comes from - and I can tell you right now, democratic policy didn't help them.

There's some data here if you'd like to read further:

    <div class="md">That makes sense with what i was saying i think. The fathers just abandoning the children is bound to cause significant mental health issues since abandonment is never a good thing. It’s unfortunate that they manifest into higher crime rates and things like that.</div>

    <div class="md">Couple of things here 

1. In absolute numbers, there are far more poor whites than blacks in the US

2. Statistical analysis has shown that race is a better predictor of criminal behaviour than socioeconomic status. 

3. Blacks in the highest income bracket commit murder at the same rate as the poorest whites. 

4. If poverty caused crime then the crime rate should have spiked during the Great Depression, however it went down.</div>

    <div class="md">let's say there is a group of peaceful protesters.  like legit peaceful, not attacking anything, not spraypainting anything, not bashing windows, not hitting people, nothing.  we both agree that this is happening and that this is legit and should be protected, right?

now let's say a group of 3-5 rioters enter that group and they start actively rioting, hitting people, spraypainting/destroying stuff, lighting buildings and cars on fire, attacking officers.  do you agree that this is genuinely happening and it is neither lawful nor morally acceptable?</div>

    <div class="md">Okay and that’s fine, those protesters are in the wrong, i was talking about some of the times where the police have started it by using tear gas, or unjustified force. That’s the only time it can be justified. Also there’s at least 4 cases of people getting hit in the head with the rubber bullets so i don’t think they should be used.</div>

    <div class="md">Unjust laws shouldn't be obeyed. 

Their are a few police instigated riots. Their are a few race baiting rioters. The looting isn't rioting. And God help us all there are even media (influencer) instigated riots and looting. Those guys are all wrong, everyone in this paragraph.

But, unjust laws need to be disobeyed.</div>

    <div class="md">I did day looters and rioters were wrong. Everyone I mentioned in the middle paragraph are in the wrong.

Unjust laws need to be disobeyed. That goes for unjust orders too. They pop up all the time but don't get changed until they are challenged.

Take for instance the governor of California has an emergency powers act that he could have used for both Covid and the cities that had riots. He invoked the emergency powers act incorrectly for Covid. He shut down some medical outlets deeming them unessential even ones that the law specifically mentions as essential (dentists are one, but preventative care was the big deal). Some clinics stayed open. They took fines and they will challenge those fines. The outcome could be a payout for all the ones that closed. He chose to do nothing during the riots and I think that was the correct move, but he had a right to intervene, some will say a duty. If it's determined the governor had a duty to use the emergency powers act, then he rightfully disregarded that duty. Perhaps the act will change if a challenge is put to it.</div>

    <div class="md">Well one thing to consider is what are you trying to change?

None of us want police officers murdering people - that's why they've been charged and they're likely going to jail.

The other thing is that the movement itself has been hijacked by people who just want to tear the system down, who are opportunistically stealing for their own benefit, etc.

And finally, we need the police - a whole squad resigned recently - can you imagine if nobody wanted to be a police officer? If you called for help and no one came? There has to be a balance.</div>

    <div class="md">I’ll respond to this part by part. 
1. Personally I am not black so I don’t want to answer for them, however my understanding is that the initial protests were to get the man who murdered George Floyd arrested. But now that he has been arrested it has now changed to protesting for an overall change in the police force.
2. That’s true, the problem was that some officers will never get charged since there is no evidence, so far in the riots there has been video evidence that conflicts with the polices reports of what is happening, this is causing increasing tensions among the protesters since they don’t want someone else’s death to be justified when the only information was coming from one officer.
3. That is very true and very unfortunate, the looters are definitely the worst of the bunch since there is usually no justification (with the only exception being if a store is refusing to sell supplies to the protesters(and even then the only thing being looted should be said supplies)). The majority of the looters are opportunistic and should be arrested since it is theft. The riots are a much harder thing to judge since one theory is that in some places the police is using undercover agents to start the riots so they can justify using force, if that is the case then the solution would be for the police to pull out of the area briefly so the rioters can calm down. But if the riots started with no provocation then there should be consequences for those who started it and possibly for those who joined and caused significant property damage.
4.We do need police yes, just not in its present form, personally i think that police should go through a much longer training program that doesn’t solely focus on physical and other similar training. A whole squad resigning is bad yes, but unfortunately that’s all they can do to show their solidarity, and although yes there is good cops the bad ones ultimately take the spotlight, (and also although they may be good there’s also a chance that they just stand by and watch a crime committed by another officer rather than help the one who the crime is committed against).
5. Yes i can imagine that scenario, it would be unfortunate yes but it might make the police force change how they do things to encourage people to join them. How they do this i don’t know. 
6. This situation “if you called and no one came” is unfortunately the reality for people today, sure an officer may turn up but they might do so little that it’s as if they never arrived, an example( this could be false but there is many similar so i believe most of it) of this is on tiktok there is at least one story where someone who is being abused, by a parent or a partner, has called the police to try to get out of the situation, and the police have just asked the abuser if everything is okay instead of talking to the abused separately. There is also the more mainstream argument when people say this and it is in response to someone saying what if you get robbed “What’s the police going to do, write down a few words on paper and never ask about it again”, personally i’ve never been robbed so i can’t speak on the validity of this claim but i have seen it so much i’m inclined to agree, i am aware that not all robberies will be dealt with like this but the fact that even a small amount are is incredibly worrying since even 0.1% can be a high number.
7. in my opinion the balance should be through the training, if they are taught more about how to respond to someone and not to shoot on impulse then that will cause an increase in police related deaths, of course if an officer has undeniable reason to believe that he will be shot, he can still shoot, but otherwise he has to try to calm the situation or to listen to the person, or the people around, the person who he suspects</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;if that is the case then the solution would be for the police to pull out of the area briefly so the rioters can calm down.

I kinda lost it at this line dude - [that's what they did in Minneapolis and it's part of the reason the city literally burned.](https://www.newsweek.com/minneapolis-police-flee-protesters-1507266)

&gt;But if the riots started with no provocation then there should be consequences for those who started it 

What kind of consequences? How do you capture someone wearing a mask in a riot unless you get them then and there?

Maybe you could taze them, use pepper spray, hit them with some sort of blunt object so that you can subdue them? Uh oh, here we are with "brutality" again.

Have you seen any of the videos of rioters beating innocent people in the streets? If you haven't, let me know and I'll send you some videos - they're getting harder and harder to find as they're being covered up. Suffice it to say, more than one black police officer has been attacked and killed trying to prevent looters from looting.

&gt;if they are taught more about how to respond to someone and not to shoot on impulse then that will cause an increase in police related deaths

I agree, but floyd wasn't shot. Also, watch a few videos of police getting killed during routine stops and you'll realize how dangerous it is to simply pull someone over in America.

The one that really got me is now used as a training video for a police force - the officer asked the men to open the trunk which was filled to the brim with bricks of marijuana - the 3 people pulled over beat him to death right there and left him to die on the side of the road - it was caught on dashcam.

People need to remember why we respect the police - and also, as you said, we should defend ourselves when we can (hence the second amendment being so important). It's actually for the second amendment that I generally lean right - democrats desperately want to disarm you and then - what? Disband the police force? 

Anarchy.</div>

    <div class="md">1.Okay I’ll be honest if that first solution caused what happened in mineapolis then it proposes wouldn’t work, but unfortunately if that doesn’t work then we need to think of something that will.
2.The consequences should be at a minimum paying for the destruction they caused, and yes the masks make this an incredibly difficult job. Also why is brutality in “” that is literally brutality especially the hit them part, and pepper spray is being used on inocent bystanders and children so as of right not it is not a good solution. 
3. I haven’t seen the videos no, but i wadnt defending the majority of the rioters, and the police officer that was killed is terrible, they looters who did it should be in jail, but they all probably had masks so unfortunately that’s unlikely.
4. Floyd wasn’t shot no, but what the officer did wasn’t something that they are trained to do. I was also referring to the many cases of officers shooting black men who are simply holding an item in their hand (like a toy truck or a wallet). This could be something that happens less often with more training on how to interact with people and that shooting should not be the first option. 
5. I’ve never heard of that till now but that’s absolutely awful, did they get arrested?, because of not they definitely should’ve. 
6. What do you mean by respect the police? I respect them sure but i also don’t like them due to the system they protect. 
7. Also you can lean left and support the second amendment, i am extremely left leaning and i wholeheartedly support it since it is something that citizens should be allowed to have, and most dems are not pushing for gun removal just a stricter licensing system due to the incredibly high amount of school shootings. America also has an incredibly toxic gun culture which is why some people want to fully ban them, guns are legal in other countries and they have half the number of shooting if not even less. 
8. I don’t stand to disband it just to change it. The system is very racist which is problematic, the training is subpar since it is very physical heavy, and many cops are trigger happy and will shoot without reason. 
8. do you mean the political ideology or the overall violence</div>
