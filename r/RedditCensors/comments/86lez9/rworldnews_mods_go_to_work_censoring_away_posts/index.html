    <div class="md">A sample of the comments that were apparently too much for the mods' fee fees:

&gt;Jesus. People bending over backwards to defend ISIS. Zombified.

. 

&gt;Yeah it's important we don't blame this on ISIS, we wouldn't want to tarnish their good name...

. 

&gt;You don't get a "ISIS official membership card" - it is a string of websites held together by - the guy made it clear he is doing this for IS ... but you disagree with him, and with common sense to apologise for his actions? Get out of here you sick apologist

. 

&gt;You're retarded, the boys over at IS ask followers to do shit like this and this guy does, of course it is IS related. It's people like you walking on eggshells not to upset radiacal Islam that adds to this apologetic world.

. 

&gt;Oh like when isis beheaded a priest in church or drove a truck over children? Truly the religion of peace

. 

&gt;How many innocents are gonna have to die and suffer before we value our own citizens over these "refugees"

. 

&gt;How many more times of this will we need to wake up and start doing something more serious about these extremists. Only a small part of them are peaceful refugees.

. 

&gt;Well I know this is a lie. Reddit told me the gun laws would make this impossible

. 

This is just part and parcel of living in a big European city. And can someone remind this guy that guns are illegal in France! and so is shooting people!

&gt;If only the french were more inclusive to Muslim culture! These sort of things would not happen!

.

&gt;Religion of peace strikes again.


I could go on and on... </div>

    <div class="md">I got banned from there a year or more ago for saying after a rather tame muslim attack (There have been so many I have lost track which one) that if they continue to let in terrorist people in, then they will continue to get terrorist attacks. 

I'd tell them I told you so, but that entire ban, and I am pretty sure they don't care and probably actively support those doing it. </div>

    <div class="md">look at the mod user history, a lot of them are muslims, but perhaps more alarming a lot of them mod the same subreddits like "whitefragility" which is a pretty strong indication of how bias will manifest in their moderation.

edit: they've made the subreddit private now, but i did a lot of research on this in 2016 after they became suppressive over all of the islamic terror attacks. most of the mod accounts that joined worldnews at once are linked through their moderation of whitefragility.</div>

...sigh. So sad that all of this could've been prevented had they just not let any of them in. Use that future refugee money to help their own people first, then if they must, help these refugees int heir own countries.

    <div class="md">This sucks. Some of these comments I kind of get, as they are along the lines of “ISIS did X therefore Islam is bad” and those sorts do break the rules. 

However, a lot of other comment deletions are pretty soft. I don’t get why the people complaining in this thread don’t make their own world news sub with less censorship? The beauty of reddit is if you don’t like subreddit A you can just go to sub B or make sub Z. 

Edit: I do understand the stupidity of posting this in a sub dedicated to pointing out censorship </div>

Like a sub for news, but without the censorship. Uncensored news? I kind of like it. Yeah. I think I'll call it /r/UncensoredNews

That's why. A subreddit devoted simply to the idea that the news should be without censorship has been outlawed on this website. You can't just allow people to think a certain way. You must eliminate the wrongthink or the admins will do it for you. Truly a sad state of affairs. I do respect your suggestion and wish we could do just that. </div>

    <div class="md">Oh. I think you may have the wrong subreddit. This is a subreddit devoted to pointing out all censorship. *All* censorship. From any side.

Also I think you may have a poor understanding of the "nazi agenda." They were all about censorship. That's the polar opposite of this subreddit.

* This subreddit = against censorship
* Nazis = used censorship to further their own agenda

Or maybe it's a poor understanding of our agenda. We just catalog when censorship happens and point out that we feel it's wrong. 

You know, since you brought up Nazis and I'm thinking about it now, I'd say the subreddits we're pointing out on this sub are way more like the Nazis than this sub is. </div>
