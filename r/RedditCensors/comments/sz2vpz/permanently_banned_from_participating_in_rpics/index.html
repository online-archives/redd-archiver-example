    <div class="md">I mean, I don't really care to participate in those subs if they're going to promote the kind of environment where only Groupthink is allowed. Good idea though. Kinda funny that it's that easy to avoid their attempts at insulating themselves in a reality bubble. 

I just wonder what that conversation was like. "Hey guys, if Reddit isn't going to censor people that hurt our feelings and trigger us by spreading dangerous misinformation that goes against the gospel truth given to us by ole holy government, why don't we just shield ourselves from those people and ban anyone that posts on a sub we don't like?" Or did they think they were punishing people by preventing them from interacting with their subs? And what happens if someone realizes they made a mistake in exercising Wrongthink, is there some kind of forgiveness ceremony someone can go through to achieve cleanliness and be welcomed back into their incredibly important subreddits? 

It's hilarious how far the Left has fallen, from the 60s and 70s fighting for free speech and against censorship and authoritarianism, where they knew the government and the media couldn't be trusted... to today where they support censorship and authoritarianism and call anyone who challenges what the government and the media says a Nazi. And what's incredible is they don't see anything wrong with their behavior, with supporting censorship, or with hiding away from people they disagree with in their own little reality bubbles where they can circle jerk each other, or with applauding authoritarian tactics like trampling people with horses, or seizing people's assets and bank accounts.</div>

    <div class="md">I think the difference between then and now is that back then they were the counterculture. Also, with the civil rights movement going on and actual injustices and things they had things to fight. It's kind of like an "abyss staring back at you" type of thing. They've become the monsters they fought against.</div>
