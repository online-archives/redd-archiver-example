It's possible I deleted it - I deleted a whole bunch of stuff I posted in r/politics after because people just pile on comment threads with no way to respond and also I just don't like to add content to a sub I'm not allowed to participate in, but the comment itself was literally just me saying that hamas were terrorists which I found pretty crazy.</div>
