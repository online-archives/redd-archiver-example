If they want to fuck with us, we should fuck with them. Ruin this fucking company. Get some of their folks sent to prison. I would love to see some of these Reddit admins behind bars.</div>

Can't be an echo chamber if there is no one to make the echos.

My usage has dropped a lot, I mainly visit my obscure subs to see what's happening then leave. It's too toxic to your well-being to be on here too much.</div>

    <div class="md">The way it's written, they're not doing enough to prevent sexual services for money from people of unverified age.

For example, you can hop onto loads of subreddits and buy photos, vodeos or physical items like used underwear, bodily fluids, etc. from people, without any recordkeeping on Reddits part with regards to age, or any verification of legal compliance.

It's Reddits responsibility, under the law, to be proactive about this, and they aren't. They just allow it to happen without interference.</div>

    <div class="md">To be clear, I don't even like FOSTA-SESTA. It's way too overreactive and it's language is too vague. Tumblr actually banned porn on their platform in response to FOSTA-SESTA.

However, the law exists, and since it exists, I am pretty much okay using it against my enemies, because if they had any chance of using unfair laws against me, I know they would.</div>
