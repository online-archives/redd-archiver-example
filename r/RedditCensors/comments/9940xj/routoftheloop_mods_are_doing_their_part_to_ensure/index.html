    <div class="md">Here are the comments that the /r/OutOfTheLoop mods felt you shouldn't be allowed to see, lest it cause you to form your own opinion. I mean, that opinion might not be the one they support. And we can't have people making their own decisions, especially if that decision involves an opposing view.

A user, speaking on the infamous /r/News Pulse shooting censorship bonanza:

&gt;The shooter was Muslim, so they think the story will promote Islamophobia

Just to refresh everyone's memory, /r/UncensoredNews was created to have a place where posts like the one about the Pulse shooting wouldn't be censored, and then Reddit itself banned that subreddit. If you have any doubts on Reddit's agenda, and that of the mods of the major subs, think about all that. 

&gt;all of the big news subs are EXTREMELY liberal/left leaning.
You even so much as mention anything pro-trump or pro conservative positions and you get people barking down your neck

. 

&gt;Surely ornag man not as bad as you purport him to be

&gt;&gt;go back to t_d u dumb idiot

&gt;basically any major sub for the last 2 years, kind of got sick of it after a wee, especially as an aussie.

A /r/WorldNews mod, /u/Phedre, commented:

&gt;I'll try to answer this as a mod of a major news subreddit.

&gt;&gt;WHAT is going on with Reddit? Why are we attempting to snuff this story out? As in mods locks and deleting threads. I’m very confused as to why South African Government taking land from predominately or exclusively whites would be a story to block. This entire thing feels like Black Mirror from the actual events to what’s happening on this site.

&gt;I can't speak for /r/news, but /r/worldnews has very specific rules around misleading, sensationalized, or editorialized news. There are stories on this issue on worldnews, as you can see here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/search?q=south+africa&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=day&amp;sort=relevance
&gt;What's being removed are submissions with sensationalized titles, same as we would do for any other submission. This is not specific to the South Africa topic.
&gt;Edit: we also remove duplicate submissions, so that would also factor into removals.

Here are some replies to that which were strangely removed:


&gt;You have rules that disallow most of the Trump stories your own mods post there too. let's not pretend there isn't an agenda going on

Another reply:

&gt;Yet you allow every single sensationalized title that makes Trump look bad. Even if it's blatantly false. (Cough cough the independent cough cough) Don't pretend you are consistent in the way you enforce your rules.

More general censored comments from the thread:

&gt;one would think that what appears to be ethnic cleansing is not a left or right issue though
&gt;i've seen very little mainstream media coverage of the rohingya genocide that went on a few months ago in burma and i've seen very little coverage of the land seizures and killings of afrikaans in south africa as well.

. 

&gt;There's something sad and ironic about mods locking threads for racism when the reason why this story even exists is because of racism but not the kind that mods or the mainstream media cares about at all.

. 

&gt;Censorship is what usually happens when you have ideologically driven gatekeepers. It's nothing more complicated than that.

. 

&gt;Whomever runs the sub makes the rules. If you don't like the censorious major subs then there are plenty of alternatives on reddit (because censorship, especially when it is against reddit's site rules and explicitly ignored by reddit's admins, isn't a new thing).

. 

&gt;For obvious reasons, appealing to those that favour censorship to change is going to be a pointless endeavour. Take your eyeballs somewhere freer.

. 

&gt;Jesus Christ, I wish you people would cool it with the fucking whining. There is no conspiracy to censor this or any issue.

Edit:

I've joined the censorship victims list. They censored this comment by me:

&gt;Just a quick reminder to everyone who, like me, is anti-censorship:
&gt;You can always reverse the censorship of any comment thread by grabbing the URL for the comment thread and replacing the "r" in reddit.com to a "c". Then just wait for the thread to process and you'll be able to make your own decisions about what you want to see.

The irony is *palpable.*
