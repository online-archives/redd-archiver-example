Here’s the text:

I hope you realize why the Reddit admins cannot ban T_D. It is *not* blatantly racist in the way a lot of other subreddits are, its bigotry is much more nuanced. Reddit would get *a lot* of flack for censoring conservative opinions if it banned the largest Republican congregation on the web, even if they do a lot of bad stuff.

Additionally, cringeanarchy &amp; milliondollarextreme are not really violence-and-genocide promoting, more like 12 year olds trying to be edgy with their offensive humor (ie 9/11 jokes) and having fun being contrarians and “trolling” others, but that’s just my opinion.

But I definitely have to argue with your T_D point. I don’t think you’ve ever been on it if you’d say it’s “genocide” promoting. I think that’s a very extreme thing to say and not one to be taken lightly. There’s millions of people on the subreddit, it’s no more fair than calling AskReddit alt-right for some small amount of user comments, calling it a rape culture because of their rape thread, or generalizing a culture by the action of a few.

That’s just my opinion. I’m an ‘SJW’ lefty, I just disagree with you on those.

Edit: Wow. I can’t believe I got banned for this.... Incredible. TIL someone who is bi, believes in abortion rights, equal pay for equal work, universal healthcare, higher taxes, transgender rights, affordable housing &amp; more is an “alt-right troll” for not thinking T_D should necessarily be banned (or even just stating why I thought they couldn’t be).

———

Quite incredible. The most disturbing part is I was getting PMs from actual alt-fighters &amp; white supremecists using ceddit who saw my removed comment &amp; were amazed such a comment would result in a ban, trying to sway me to the right. I guess it shows to fuel how banning people for such innocuous comments like these (prefixing every sentence with “I think” and “I believe”), can drive people to such political extremes.</div>

    <div class="md">This is like complaining that you got banned from T\_D for not being openly enthusiastic about every shit Trump takes \(which I have been banned from there, twice, and I voted for the guy\).

If you're not a rabid Trump supporter, probably best to stay out of T\_D. If you're not a rabid Trump hater, probably best to stay out of politics, news, FTAR, and a lot of other subs.

Extremism is the only acceptable view.</div>

    <div class="md">Saved for midterms.

Keep in mind I don’t even care. I’m fiscally conservative, for the most part. But it’s obvious Dems will sweep midterms. I just don’t kid myself about the reality. Repubs didn’t pass any major legislation despite having a supermajority &amp; leading all three houses. On top of that, historically the other party wins back seats about this time.

They’re about to get raked.</div>

Those are currently one half of the top six posts. Only an idiot wouldn't acknowledge its extremity. It's an embarrassing circlejerk. I can't fathom how anybody could get such a ridiculous hard-on for any politician. I hate nearly all politicians.

Besides that, "political extreme" doesn't mean your interpretation of what's right and wrong, it's just a term to reflect a minority opinion. Being that far right is obviously blatantly politically extreme, just like the Sanders subreddits.</div>

    <div class="md">I could’ve sworn I was 26 with a JD, a degree in finance, who worked with some of the most conservative people in the world, growing up in a Christian household &amp; being conservative myself for years before becoming liberal, but maybe that’s just me. You probably know me better anyway, since you delivered that condescending comment so confidently. Who am I to doubt you, /u/MAGAforjustice? Lol...

If we’re making judgement calls off sound bytes here, I’d venture to say you’re a cringey highschooler obsessed with a celebrity politician who, for conservative ideals, has been shit in every which way from popular support to leading his party to getting anything useful passed.

Man, I could never being so infatuated with someone, let alone a politician. How embarrassing.</div>

    <div class="md">That’s great buddy. To think any platform can get all issues right, socially, politically, fiscally: it’s just really stupid. What are the chances the Rep got it right for education, for healthcare, for gay marriage, for immigration, for social welfare, etc etc etc. Probably fucking slim.

I place perfectly middle on the political compass (leaning libertarian socially). I can send you a pic lol. Only stupid people fanboy either party.

There’s obvious truths both ways and dickriding poliical organizatios blinds you to blatant facts. Universal healthcare *obviously* works best by every metric ever. Less guns *obviously* equals more safety, again, by every metric ever. Higher corporate taxes equals less tax revenue, by every metric ever. Don’t kid yourself about reality.</div>

I would argue that I almost exclusively expose myself to the opposite side. Like we're literally having this conversation.

&gt;I also listen to TYT

You shouldn't. Even before you get into where they stand on the issues, it should be apparent that they're all wildly uninformed partisan whiners. There's a reason Jimmy Dore has distanced himself from Cenk and Ana.

    <div class="md">lol you’re in a conservative sub. People getting trolled by T_D on /r/fuckthealtright aren’t exposing themselves to new ideas.

And they are. So is Shapiro. Joe Rogan is just a stupid libertarian. You should consume a healthy diet of a diverse collection of political ideology.

You seem to be under the impression simply listening indicates political standing. It does not.

Even the fact you told me I shouldn’t listen to TYT. Tf out of here. If you weren’t an idiot you’d realize Shapiro is just as conservative as they are liberal lol, and if anything liberals have a much better hold on social issues. Progressives have never been considered wrong historically for social issues. Blacks weren’t freed and we realized that was wrong. We never allowed gay marriage and then thought “that was a mistake”.

Inversely, we *have* instituted policies that could make either side look bad. The post-depression recovery was way too slow &amp; extended the Great Depression. The bush tax cuts didn’t help anybody and led to the worst economic crises since. Shapiro &amp; TYT speak on *culture*, generally not policy.</div>

This is how the ideology on the left works. If you had been the subject of a Communist regime, they would have killed you for this. Just so you're aware.

People like you remind me how stupid political idealogies can be by demonizing the other side. In Nazi germany I’m sure you would’ve been sent to jail for espousing the opposite ideas but I don’t use that as an argumentative point because it makes no sense to.</div>
