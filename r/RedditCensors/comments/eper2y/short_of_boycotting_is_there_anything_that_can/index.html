      <div class="md">/r/science and /r/futurology used to be a pair of fairly fun, if not entirely reliable, subreddits to learn new things about current scientific research and findings, but more and more and more they're becoming infested with buzzfeed quality articles and many articles which promote bad science.

This wouldn't, inherently, be a problem except that the moderators are quick to "Side with" such articles and will remove any comment (However researched, articulated and appropriate) that dissent from the article's conclusion. 

While I can fully appreciate that being a moderator of "Big-name subs" like the ones mentioned above can be hard, and a large number of the comments removed would be justifiably so, the mods are extremely improvident and will reflexively ban any comment that even points out a study reversing causation (And supply evidence to support that claim).

The end result of this is further enforcement of this clickbaity, buzzfeedy, psuedoscience push on the above reddits which is seriously detracting their quality and usefulness while further promoting the spread of misinformation and "Fake news", which is particularly condemning given part of reddit's strength (once upon a time) was specifically minimising such things due to reasonable, unpaid moderators.

The problem is that there is no way to highlight this misuse of power, no way to discuss it, to shine light on it nor to create any kind of discourse or social pressure to change. Any thread on any mainstream reddit on the subject of moderation is immedately removed and while subreddits like this one exist, they're dwarfed by the larger subreddits in which this sort of mod behaviour is commonplace.

So I ask the title:

While obviously I could just "leave" those subreddits and pretend they may as well not exist, that seems like a poor solution in that it... doesn't actually solve anything. Beyond that, is there anything that can be done about moderation teams ignoring the rules they are supposed to be enforcing, over moderating to their own bias and fundamentally detrimenting the subreddits they should be preserving?</div>

    <div class="md">Leaving the sub does solve something - it solves the problem of you being constantly exposed to badly curated content that wastes your time and attention. Find better subs. 

You're basically your own moderator on Reddit. Prune the hedges. Cut out the crap. There are many, far better subs than "science" and whatever the other lame one you mentioned. You just first have to decide what you really want to get out of Reddit (hint: not the best place to "learn" about "science")</div>

    <div class="md">I'll phrase it another way:

why do you want access to "interesting findings, big shakeups, and so on" in the field of so-called science? how do you decide who to trust to contextualize those types of articles for you? media platforms like these are great at generating content but terrible at generating context. we don't know the people or motives behind what content gets circulated, so we're like lost children, waiting for the next shiniest toy to come tumbling out of the production chute.

what I'm saying is you should be here to entertain yourself - not "inform" or "educate" yourself</div>

    <div class="md">I've seen this happen with a few subs. I joined reddit just before the 2016 elections really heated up and it was almost overnight I was unable to escape the onslaught of everything anti-trump. Love him or hate him, when the top 4 posts are "sources say trump did X" and "trump watches 8 hours of special gorilla tv" I'm going to unsubscribe (and hopefully I'm not alone in this). Removing myself from News, politics and Worldnews has made my experience considerably better. So many non toxic and not overly moderated  political subs exist, it's easy to find one that has friendly people just looking for discussion, not just an echo chamber.</div>
