This has turned R-Politics into a Left Wing Hellhole. What value does a Political site have if it doesn't display all views.
Censorship at it's worst

Below is the post I wrote and it was down voted 45 times than hidden. I object to a policy where a site that is supposed to be neutral will not allow opposing views to be heard.

Below is a link to the post, you'll find me hidden at the bottom of it. And I've also copied and pasted what I posted below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7rn60l/republicans_are_preparing_to_shut_down_the/

It is not the Republicans shutting down the Government.

What does DACA have to do with the Budjet? Why is approval of DACA such an issue that the Government should close over it?

The Republicans have been clear

Build the Wall

End Chain Migration

3 Implement Merit Based immigration

For them to start legalizing large amounts of immigrants, they have to be sure that our immigration system is fixed.

Why are the Democrats so hot about keeping our broken immigration system. Because 8 out of 10 newly naturalized citizens vote for the Democratic Party.

Why are the Rhinos in the Republican Party allowing it. Because they are owned by the special interest groups who want cheap immigrant labor to keep their cost of labor down.

And who is shafted? Tne middle class and especially lower middle class who have had there wages driven down by illegal immigrants.

I have nothing against DACA but I'm a populist and I don't think that our current immigration system is good for America.

And before you call me a Racist ask my Mexican Wife and my hispanic children about my White Privilege.</div>

    <div class="md">Couldn't agree more. I've been on this site for a little over 2 weeks but had that fact nailed down in bout two days. Such a shame, I naively went in there posting my views openly and got downvoted to smithereens in a hurry. Probably not hard to correctly discern which way of center I lean. To post anything remotely positive about something POTUS has done gets you shit on hard. It's all feels and tears over there. Disgusting.</div>

If they don't want to show all views including right wing than change the name to /rliberalpolitics.

    <div class="md">Baozebub if you lived in America you'd realize that the left is way more  intolerant and that the right is much more open to ideas.

Perfect example is that right wing speakersare being intimidated not to speak at Universities with threats of violence.

The way America has always worked a speaker with an opposing view comes to University. The students politely listen than after the speech there is question and answer. At which time the students can ask questions and argue with the speaker.

Now the leftist University's won't allow speakers with opposing right wing views because the student boycott, protest, get violent. They are so intolerant that they are unwilling to even listen to an opposing view.

    <div class="md">Its a sad state of affairs then you have to throw in the Mexican Wife and Hispanic children as a defense against being called racist by these vicious bloodthirsty leftist censors. At this point they don't even care what you're, its the internet, the only place there they can get away with their commie bullshit, so they will proceed to sniff their own farts in this reddit shit bubble.</div>

    <div class="md">As a non-American hoping to hear from both sides I’m a bit disappointed in Reddit. That being said - *all American discussion* boards seem to be that way. There is no right-leaning equivalent to Reddit. I know there’s a lot pointless comments here that do nothing but sling insults or toe the party line, but the majority of them are actual on-topic, logical, calm discussions. I have never found a right-leaning board that is like that. 

Just look at the comments from this article on uncensored news today:

https://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorednews/comments/7rriru/3_arrested_for_raping_man_pouring_bleach_onto_his/

It’s basically a bunch of people calling blacks niggers, then getting upvoted because of it. That’s a pretty good representation of what all the pro-Republican boards devolve into that I have come across. 

I honestly don’t know if this is an indication of who the Republican base is, I just haven’t found the right site, or if it means the intellectual Republicans have abandoned the internet out of frustration - but either way it seems the Republican base has lost the war for the internet. The democrats seem to dominate all corners of it.

    <div class="md">No worries mate. Drew hit the nail on the head.

What I would want is all subreddits playing by the same rules. They get to the front page (or not) based on their own merits and the people's votes.

I'm sick of the selective and biased approach some of the admin and mods have openly displayed. That's all.
