    <div class="md">The whole "locked due to excessive racism/sexism/doxxing/personal attacks" is just a way of controlling the narrative. In many cases the comments that trigger these locks aren't even hateful, and transpire in a way that makes you question the political agenda behind the mods taking such action. When mods do this--especially prematurely--it's because they want to become the story. They want people to click the post see "locked due to excessive racism" and say "oh wow those alt right trolls ruined yet another thread" without bothering to scroll. </div>

    <div class="md">I have watched it happen in several different subreddits. Usually what happens is some people will say stuff that goes with the narrative. All upvoting each other.

 Then, a few others come along and argue against the narrative. They of course get downvoted to oblivion as they lack the numbers of the original crew, but soon more and more people join and the up/down votes become more equalized. 

Once that happens the mod's lock the thread, delete a bunch of posts that were against the narrative citing "rule X"(whether they were or not) and then claim they had to lock the thread because of the alt-right.. It happens so often it is practical a meme at this stage. 

r/toronto goes even further. They claim right off the bat that it will be a controversial thread and thus will only allow those with significant r/toronto posting histories allowed(What they classify as significant is never defined) and then run through pro-actively removing any post that goes against the narrative, banning people along the way.

Notice how many are private schools that can pick their athletes and students? Notice their rosters (I'll save you the trouble, they are overwhelmingly black)

NBA is full of stupid as hell liberal morons who are afraid of an honest discussion.
