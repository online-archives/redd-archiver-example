      <div class="md">Hello. I have a case of reddit censorship to share, originating from what should be a censorship free zone, r/conspiracy. I have proof which can be found in the following.  
  
[Original post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6iid87/bill_to_stop_arming_terrorists_gets_only_13/) [archive](http://archive.is/sAeyj) where a mod of r/conspiracy posts false information easily disproven. They then delete it when they realize people are calling them out.  
  
[My correction post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6imtdi/correction_bill_to_stop_arming_terrorists_has_not) [archive](http://archive.is/SELPE) It had obvious support but was removed by a mod for violation of rule 10, which from my reading means they saw it as an attack on the sub/mods. It is important that users who contribute time and effort to the sub are aware of the bias of their moderators, especially when it will be used to control narratives.  
  
[I have sent their mod team my thoughts on the matter](http://i.imgur.com/befIiun.jpg) and I submit the facts to you now. I hate censorship in all forms, especially when used as a tool to disguise misdeeds. Thank you for your time.  
  
Edit: [Response from a r/conspiracy mod](http://i.imgur.com/OoGeMFn.png)  
  
**Not wanting your moderation team attacked because of their duties is understandable. But when a moderator directly posts knowingly bad information, then tries to hide it when informed it is wrong, they need to be exposed. Had they updated their own post with the correction and flaired it, none of this would have been happening. This is not a simple case of "you attacked a mod". This is a case of a mod behaving in a nefarious way and trying to hide their misdeed. Rule 10 should not be applied in this type of case, as this is not an attack on a mod just for performing their duties. And if Rule 10 is intended to allow mods to get away with lying to their users and provoking emotions through false narrative, then the sub as a whole is lost and no longer worth consideration as anything but satire.**

    <div class="md">Yeah that entire sub is utter trash. It's just as narrative pushing as all the other places. I'm pretty sure it was infiltrated by a bunch of SJW retarded fucks at some point in time. I got banned there for I have no fucking idea but I think it was when I called out some of the bullshit I saw. Just no point being on that sub anymore.</div>

    <div class="md">Jesus Fucking Christ.  It's not even just that the original post was inflammatory bullshit.  It's not just that it was immediately debunked.  It's not even that the MOD *removed their request for sources proving them wrong*.  Nah, then claims being brigaded and attacked.  Wow, it's the account you use to MOD /r/conspiracy, but it only becomes "too real" when you get called out on being a gobshite.

    <div class="md">What I want to know is, as a mod why didn't ~~they just scratch out the errors~~?

Let's be optimistic and say you taught them something new. Why can't new information be accepted without there being discord? That isn't to say it shouldn't be vetted, but information especially by a mod should hold value. 

It makes more sense to me, to wonder where these two sides differ and what the point to this could be. Instead of the information being discussed we have our own r/subredditdrama (no offense meant) </div>

    <div class="md">I agree it's disappointing. I've haven't experienced this in the subreddit you just experienced, but I have experienced it. 

We should be able to disagree. We should be able to discuss why we disagree. In retrospect I feel another mod should have gotten involved. While I don't believe in self censorship, I certainly think a separate mod could have asked you to choose a synonym or something. </div>
