I posted https://np.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/qaeunt/7_reasons_why_shipping_container_homes_are_a_scam/

Despite it being upvoted, there were people in the comment section who were calling my account the scam and to look at my post history. Another user called me a 'complete conspiracist' 'professional account' was called a whackjob and told to shut the fuck up, someone suggested I was part of the qanon crowd and anti-semetic. I got downvoted into oblivion for simply defending myself against these accusations. Someone said I am just trying to farm karma there, what sense does that even make for someone to post to a small sub expecting to get very little karma when I could post to another sub and get thousands of upvptes?? They can't imagine people with a ton of karma would want to 1) genuinely contribute to subs with stuff they like and care about and 2) karma not be their primary concern and 3) have no hidden agenda. Anyways, the person who said I was just posting it for karma, also told me to fuck off and go get intubated, which I guess is them telling me to go catch covid and die. 

The woman who made the video, even made a response video to all those who were attacking her over the first:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjbgduaH_7U?

I wrote to the mod about these comments:

&gt;I know this user here is being upvoted and I am downvoted despite being genuine, but how is name calling rewarded here? https://np.reddit.com/r/TinyHouses/comments/qaeunt/7_reasons_why_shipping_container_homes_are_a_scam/hh44w8j/

No reply.

Not long after I replied to these users, my post was removed and I wrote to moderators: 

&gt;Curious why my post here was removed, as this was posted even to videos https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/j1o1gn/7_reasons_why_shipping_container_homes_are_a_scam/ and it was upvpted and allowed up, as it was being upvpted here despite it being removed anyways. I'm also curious why these users are allowed to be so fucking mean to others, making innuendoes about them being crazy conspiracy theorists and telling them to fuck off. I may not have posted here before, though I thought I did (maybe my posts were removed?) but I have posted to other tiny home subs, cabin and van subs, so I am genuinely participating, not trolling.

No reply.

2 days later I get:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/TinyHouses. You can still view and subscribe to r/TinyHouses, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/TinyHouses by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

This is not the first time I have posted to tiny house subs. I have posted to tinyhome and tinyhouse and I was pretty sure I also posted to tinyhomes, but I don't see anything when I look up myself there, but perhaps they removed any previous posts I had made. I don't think what I posted was worthy of a perma ban, but even if a mod makes that case, how can they turned a blind eye to those making these nasty comments?</div>

    <div class="md">I think "scam" might be a bit harsh, but they are definitely not the environmentally friendly alternative that they once thought they were. I watched the same video a few days ago and found it very informative.

Plus there was a shipping container apartment recently that had to be canceled indefinitely because the containers have gone up in price so much and are hard to find. 

But.. A lot of these things these days don't care about facts, only money.</div>

    <div class="md">I gotcha. It's crazy that Biden, Kamala, Pelosi, Fauci, even ACLU were against mandates a year ago, a few of them pushing vaccine hesitancy or outright saying they would not take it, but are now accusing people of being anti-vax for criticizing their lies over covid (specifically from Fauci and Biden) and their hypocrisy over mandates. They even accused John Campbell and Robert Malone of being anti-vax for talking about the effectiveness of the vaccines and how they are implemented. Look how Cuomo was being given an award over covid while the nursing home scandal was happening and how later he said he doesn't trust health experts and when people like myself were calling him out at the start and pointing out how he was being promoted on social media via astroturf, we were censored. Reminds me of how we could say Fuck Trump anytime anywhere and be cheered for it, but now if we say 'let's go Brandon,' we are accused of being cowards etc and right-wingers lmao. The hypocrisy of the liberal/neoliberal (not leftists) crowd, is astounding and their absolutist mindset and embrace of censorship and the security state, is very alarming.</div>
