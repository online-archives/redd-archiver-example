    <div class="md">A lot of childhood "mental health" is built on pathologizing normal male behavior and instilling destructive values into men. 

Women need to feel intrinsic self worth. 

Men need to earn their self worth. Men cannot simply tell themselves that they are worthy, that just doesn't work. Men need to be given the opportunity to demonstrate to themselves and to others that they can live the values that Men instinctively respect in others.

So long as Men today stay fat, single, addicted to porn, and wasting their lives on video games, they won't feel esteem.</div>

    <div class="md">I love how you act like men using coping strategies to ignore problems is new. Yes, video games and the overwhelmingly widespread availability of porn are relatively new, but they’re just being used instead of the tobacco and alcohol that they would have used in previous generations.

On top of that a lot more men are now single that would’ve gotten a wife in the past, because in the past women literally had to get a husband if they wanted a house and food. I do think the internet does encourage more anti social behavior which is also a factor but to act like mental health issues and the negative repercussions of them simply didn’t exist is so demonstrably incorrect.</div>

    <div class="md">Look man, the mental health industry is like the education industry, its extremely left-wing and very feminine. I don't think these work for men. I think that traditional education as constructed by women has been completely disastrous for men's mental health. Feminizing men has not been good for their wellbeing, and continuing to run in that direction is even worse. I don't think most men are doing poorly because they are bottling up their feelings, but because they have to exist in a society that only puts weight on emotionality. 

I was in HS way over a decade ago and even then my mental health was horrible. It was really a suffocating environment where masculine interest were not valued or entertained, and where young men had to predominatly take their social queues from finger-wagging middle-nannies as opposed to any traditionally male role-models. 

My mental health improved rapidly when I left and joined Marine Corps and, later, wildland firefighting. Challenge, adversity, risk-taking, adventure, responsibility, these are things that men need to adopt a healthy mental attitude. They aren't going to find mental wellbeing in a shrinks office, they are going to find it in the struggle to accomplish something. 

I'm back in school now and I'm surrounded by miserable people and they are miserable because they are weak, and they are weak because no one has ever conditioned them. 

It's like the difference between the runner's high an experienced runner gets during a marathon, and the absolute misery of running your first mile as an untrained couch potato. Except in life we all have to run occasionally in a metaphorical sense. You can be well-trained and thrive on the challenge or you can approach every milestone as a misery that must be slogged through before you can go back to doing nothing.</div>

    <div class="md">Resilience is absolutely important, but abusing people who aren’t resilient doesn’t consistently give a positive result. I think it’s incredibly valuable to be able to deal with getting punched in the face, but just randomly punching people is very often (but not always) going to backfire. For the record, I was raised by a super tough. and highly intelligent ‘everyone who goes to bars is a loser’ Green Beret dad and his colleagues, so I’m familiar with the flaws in this ideology.</div>

    <div class="md">When did I say we should abuse people?   
There are enough challenges in life that all we need to do is not baby people along. We see this constantly in the education system where we continually infantalize even adults. We have no definition for what being an adult means today or any expectations for it. 

And being abused doesn't make you hard either. It often makes people weaker and more fucked up. It's the opposite of raising people to accept challenge and responsibility.</div>

    <div class="md">You are a lying fool. 

The ugliest,  oldest and fattest woman can get laid. There are several "couples" channel accounts across the internet to demostrate this. And you can also simply just log into pornhub to see your lie debunked. 

You're dishonesty about this subject is to deceive people into thinking women have it as bad as men. 

Women who "can't get laid", are withholding sex from men who don't fit their criteria. 

How long have you been a man-hater?</div>

    <div class="md">This is just more proof that most modern ‘feminists’ have forgotten that ‘feminism’ isn’t and never was ‘man hating’ but always about equality. 

You log on to tik tok nowadays, and all ‘feminists’ seem to be wishing men dead and it’s disgusting. And making the gender divide wider through hatred and sour feelings, rather than ever fixing any of the problems.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean yeah, it’s hard to be sure of what peoples intentions are. That said, one of my masters is in Fine Art (which is a subject heavily laden with feminist theory) so I feel like I have a decent grip on what the motives have been from the beginning. It’s quite difficult for anyone who suffered oppression to not foster resentment and anger, which inevitably manifests into a revenge mindset.</div>

The quote you posted is the feminist version of Nietzsche’s famous “Into the Darkness” quote. I was agreeing with it.

>Mary Wollstonecraft was a pioneer of women's rights and was not the least bit misandrous.

She’s one person, and one that has had many claims of internalized misogyny throughout the years. So, while not necessarily misandrist, she definitely has some misogynistic traits.

    <div class="md">And yet you haven't provided any evidence to support your claims up until this point. That's weird for someone with a master's degree, in my experience at least. I bet I wouldn't need to look too far into your comment history to find you demanding someone provide you with evidence of their claims though. 

Also, the 'FA' in MFA stands for fine arts. It's especially weird that you don't even know that much. Based on the evidence I've seen... I choose to believe you are full of it.</div>

Evidence for what? That feminism is rooted in misandry? Yeah sure let me write up a 5000 word essay just for you to stick your fingers in your ears and say “nuh uh!” Why would I bother? You posted a quote from the 1700s! As if that is, in any way, relevant to modern day feminism. You are woefully equipped for this conversation but your floundering is at least entertaining.</div>

    <div class="md">Calm down captain insecurity, before you miss out on your promotion to major. I am responding to your claim that: "Feminism has been thinly veiled misandry **since nearly the beginning."** Mary Wollstonecraft is basically the beginning.

If you don't know how to cite reputable sources to back up your claims, I don't know what to tell you. Maybe it's time for you to get another MFA in fine arts, from the ATM machine, using your PIN number.</div>

    <div class="md">Google? Homie I didn’t need to Google when Feminism started. I knew that off the top of my head because that is when the Women’s Convention was held, the **literal** start of the feminist movement. You can go back to 100 AD and find women advocating for other women, but that doesn’t mean the **movement** started then. It is a commonly accepted fact that first wave feminism started in 1848. Like I said, read more than one book. You’re sitting here telling me to read one book when it’s clearly the only book you’ve read on the topic while I’ve read close to a hundred and written multiple thesis’ on feminism.

    <div class="md">"I've read close to a hundred and written multiple thesis' on feminism" is perhaps the most insecure thing I've seen anyone say on Reddit. 

None of this is about who is the authority on the matter, it's about who constructs the most solid argument based or verifiable information. You've provided exactly zero in that department. Tell me more about how awesome you are though, I think you're about to convince me. 

Just out of curiosity, how passionately do you support the women's rights movement after reading so much on the subject? You must be a mega fan of feminism or something.</div>

    <div class="md">Nah, I'm not so insecure that I feel the need to spout off my credentials at every turn. But I am curious, that much is true. I also like to read, Soni took some time out last night to read your comment history going back over the last month. What a ride. Turns out, you're constantly making busted arguments all day on Reddit and getting called out for it. 

[Okay Edgelord “two degrees” Jackson](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreationNtheUniverse/comments/1aevxug/comment/koogab8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) was a personal highlight. [Here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeclineIntoCensorship/comments/1ajyyzy/comment/kpe1tit/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/1ah60d8/comment/kp52dq9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1acojof/comment/kk254kj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) [and here](https://www.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/19b4num/comment/kir1tbb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) are comments that can be applied to any and all of the arguments I read through in your history. There's a very clear pattern of your insecurities on display and consistency in the way other users see through your nonsense. Just on that topic, I thought I had seen you make the most insecure comment on Reddit until I read this gem: [Eh, every metric that has ever measured my intelligence has said otherwise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/1acojof/comment/kk1hzez/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) But then, you hit me with: [I am smart. Aced my ASVAB with a 99, got a 1450 on my SAT, a 30 on my ACT, finished both masters magna cum laude.](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/195yye8/comment/ki6oazp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I literally had to stop for a moment at that point because I was laughing so hard. 

Perhaps my favourite thread for the schadenfreude entertainment was the one that ended with: [I’m convinced you don’t even comprehend the words you’re using.](https://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/19fahus/comment/kjukx2y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) That particular thread was a massive disaster for you. Did you get banned from the Austrian economics sub after that? I hope not, I would love for you to go back to tell those very clearly educated people just how clever you are. Maybe you can tell them about your two masters degrees, while sounding like someone struggling to pass high school. I will give an honourable mention to [Maybe you do have degrees. If so, I would agree it was a waste of your time. You seem to have come out of University the same dullard who went in. I'm incredulous as to your education level, not because of a schoolyard envy as you maintain, but because you share the misguided notions of a backwater welfare case.](https://www.reddit.com/r/the_everything_bubble/comments/195yye8/comment/ki3whsx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) That while comment was pretty spot on and the best you could muster was to call it an unhinged rant. Says everything about you really. 

But maybe another Redditor put it best when they said: [Buddy, there is no point in answering you. Whatever answer I provide, your response will be the same. Combative, assumptive, derogatory, imperious. And angry. So very, very angry. This is, seemingly, the tone you use whenever anyone triggers you, and you sir are quite easily triggered. So that will be a hard pass from me. I'm not here to indulge whatever mental demons are tormenting you. You're not interested in an exchange of ideas and we both know it. Honestly, I'm not sure how someone who is so full of venom can even function. I imagine that in real life, you probably don't. I feel sorry for you. That's not fake- I truly do.

Take care of yourself, bud. I suspect that if you were left to your own devices you would probably keep screaming at my comments indefinitely, but this will be my last interaction with you. I sincerely hope that you find more constructive outlets. Be well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesNews/comments/1ah60d8/comment/kp8remx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

It seems clear to me and everyone else you try to flex on here that your output does not live up to your claimed level of education. Simply by drawing the conclusion that I've only read one book on a subject is pretty telling about the way you think. But more telling is the overwhelming lack of citation for any of your claims. The first thing I was taught at university was how to determine the validity of a source. And you, as a reliable source of information, suck.

With all that out of the way, did you want to talk about modern feminism or it's beginnings? Because you've been a little bit inconsistent... To say the least.</div>

    <div class="md">The evidence I provided shows a pattern of you making assumptions and not being able to back them up, you really don't have to keep doing it with me. 

The evidence I provided pushes back against your original claim.

The evidence you provided has yet to be provided.

Your comment history speaks for itself, I just put a couple of the greatest hits from the past month in a comment. Well, I say a couple but it was more like a dozen or so from memory... From the past month. As in, you are constantly doing this.

But you know what? You could have sailed right past all of that and simply addressed my question about feminism at the end. But your precious little ego couldn't let you. Because deep down you want this argument derailed, because that's all you've got. Every argument you've had for the past month, which is way too many to be healthy, proves that.

    <div class="md">I’m the one who wants the conversation derailed yet you’re the one who started talking about my post history when you realized you were academically outclassed. Right.

What evidence did you provide? A single quote from a random woman in the 1700s that nobody considers to be a part of the feminist movement, all because you’re ignorant on the subject and have nothing else of substance to say? You’re the only person in the world who thinks feminism started before 1848, so congrats on being a dunce I guess.</div>

If you won't answer that, then let me ask another. Out of the 2-4 other people you're presumably arguing with right now... Have you tried telling them you have two masters degrees yet? It might sway them, it's pretty convincing.</div>

    <div class="md">[I literally cited a source in my previous comment. You pretending like you don’t see it because you don’t want to address the irrefutable evidence it presents is hilarious.](https://www.reddit.com/kr5mwk7?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)

Is that you, in another comment thread, citing one book and pretending to be an expert? I suppose it's a good thing you aren't a hypocrite, that way we can all safely conclude you are projecting. 

What would I have to be angry about? I have pretty clearly stated and demonstrated that you are all talk and no substance. For example, you're still at zero citations for any of the claims you've made in this exchange with me. 

The really strange thing is, I never claimed to be an expert. You did that about yourself. You're the one supposedly with the masters degrees, who has read nearly 100 papers on feminism... Yet somehow you think Mary Wollstonecraft's book is a "shit source" when it comes to the subject of feminism. 

By the way, if I spent a couple of hours reading your comment history and you see that as proof that I am obsessed with you... What does it say about you that you have spent 100s of hours reading feminism literature, but don't defend women's rights? I know you can't answer that, not even with the benefit of having two imaginary masters degrees.</div>

    <div class="md">And my source is foundational. You seriously want to keep dismissing Mary Wollstonecraft and her book A Vindication of the Rights of Women? Google who the mother of feminism is. 

Better yet, don't take my or Google's word for it. Meet [Dr Bridget Cotter.](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/cotter-bridget) As you can see Dr Cotter is verified as having a PhD, which bury even your imaginary credentials, and is a a lecturer at the University of Westminster. She leads units on subjects such as Western Political Thought; Questioning Rights; Gender, Politics and the State. Dr. Cotter's specialisms for postgraduate and undergraduate dissertation supervision include: political theory; feminist theory; and gender equality. Let's see what she has to say:

[In this article she published in The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/mary-wollstonecraft-an-introduction-to-the-mother-of-first-wave-feminism-201046#:~:text=Mary%20Wollstonecraft%20has%20had%20something,refusing%20to%20take%20her%20seriously.) Dr Cotter says: 

*"As the author of an impassioned plea for human rights, and one of the earliest and most-read statements of feminism, Wollstonecraft today has a well-deserved status as a feminist icon."*

*"Wollstonecraft’s most famous text, A Vindication of the Rights of Women, is largely a treatise on the edifying effects of the right kind of education on virtue."*

*"Wollstonecraft did not mean sexual purity when she spoke of virtue, however. Virtue was indicative of moral character and primarily expressed in the ability to make sound, informed and rational judgements."*

*"Wollstonecraft argued that women are equally capable of acquiring these virtues and of benefiting from a full education if only given the chance to develop their capacities in the same way as men.*"

*"Rational qualities, argues Wollstonecraft, are not naturally gendered. They are learned and shaped by environment, especially by upbringing, education and culture. If education is narrow and confined, it will produce narrow and confined thinking. This is what she meant when she wrote of women: “Make them free and they will quickly become wise and virtuous.”*"

You see, the thing is... you haven't refuted the legitimacy of my source in any way. So there hasn't been any need for additional sources. I made my point and cited it in my very first reply to you, for anyone else who was educated enough to understand it. The rest of this was me curious about how committed you are to this bit.

So go on, show anyone reading this just how clever you really are. Build your argument, make your case, and provide clear and reliable citation. Looking forward to it!</div>

    <div class="md">You still can’t wrap your head around the fact that Feminism is a movement that started in 1848 and that your source is irrelevant because the ideas it contains were posthumously adopted. You’re so mad your source is shit that you keep clinging to it in desperation instead of moving past the fact that you fumbled your initial argument. You haven’t refuted anything, rather made yourself look like an uneducated fool, and are now attempting to double and triple down instead of arguing against my main point, which was: that Feminism has been about thinly veiled misandry since nearly the beginning (the beginning being 1848).</div>

    <div class="md">Naww... Sounds like you stopped laughing. I guess I should let you in on the joke.

A piece of context your little googled fact didn't help you realise is that the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 is only considered the beginning of the women's rights movement in America. The term that describes the beginnings of feminism across the world is First-wave Feminism. And guess what? Mary Wollstonecraft is known as the mother of First-wave Feminism. 

It is so strange that you, with your 2 masters degrees and having read nearly 100 papers on feminism, haven't shown any sign of knowing that. Or any of the facts on the subject.

Please do continue on about how the mother of feminism is irrelevant to feminism. It sure makes me look uneducated.</div>

    <div class="md">Opposing the existence of the draft isn't a realistic policy, it's a half assed pipe dream used as an excuse to avoid campaigning for the downsides of equality.

Plenty of feminists were running around handing out white feathers as an act of public shaming for cowardice to men not in a military uniform during both world wars.....including to soldiers on leave after a stint at the front AND SIXTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS WHO WEREN'T EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO FIGHT.

And that's before we get into how it</div>

    <div class="md">When you say feminism has ALWAYS been a cesspit of misandry, you must have missed that Wollstonecraft argued women are entitled to an equal education. One which aligns with their position among society, as mothers, housewives, and laborers. 

 She discusses the idea of “woman’s place” within society and reasoned that, instead of simply being regarded as domesticated housewives living in the shadow of their husbands, women could become “companions” to their male counterparts through the means of equal education prove beneficial for all of society.

Is that the cesspit of misandry you believe feminism has ALWAYS been?</div>

    <div class="md">Speaking on behalf 100% of western women certainly says a lot about who you are. 

Let me introduce you to [Eleanor Smeal.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Smeal?wprov=sfla1) She is a modern day feminist who believes women should be included equally when it comes to conscription. 

[Here](https://feminist.org/resources/feminist-chronicles/part-iii-the-early-documents/women-and-the-military/) is an article she wrote advocating for women to be included in the draft. In it she asserts:

"omission from the registration and draft ultimately robs women of the right to first class citizenship"

Ultimately though, she is against the draft in general.</div>

    <div class="md">I’m sorry for having an opinion you disagree with. I didn’t realise your petty paper thin patience would crack immediately at me daring to have a different opinion, and that you would be so overly emotional about it. Go eat your feelings in a tub of ice cream or something, instead of bitching to me about it though, because I honestly don’t care if you want to whinge and moan as if only you can discern the truth. Save it for someone that will pander to your childish tantrum.</div>

    <div class="md">No it does not.

The claim was men cause the most domestic violence.  Statistics show that men and women are about equal in instigating domestic violence.  The debate was not about who causes the most injuries.

Your argument is equivalent to "men cause the most car accidents" and responding with "drunks cause the most".  That might be true, but it has nothing to do with the original claim.</div>

    <div class="md">But that claim on its own is without meaning. 

My argument is not equivalent to that at all. My argument would be equivalent to saying (if it were true) that men might cause more accidents, but the accidents are less severe.

You need to measure severity as well as incidence when you're measuring stuff or you're not really measuring anything.</div>

    <div class="md">You just won't let it go.  Despite it not having a fucking thing to do with the original discussion, you just keep going on about it.  Severity never came up at all until YOU mentioned it months later.

It had nothing to do with the discussion.  Get that through your pea sized adolescent brain of yours.  It had nothing to do with the discussion.  How many fucking times does this need to be said?  It had nothing to do with the discussion.

You are going on my permanent ignore list because you are too fucking stupid to listen to.</div>

    <div class="md">Not if you're talking about how many infections there are in all and who is more likely to be infected. Then it's about incidence.

Your argument is also undermining the entire push against domestic violence because the point isn't severity, the point is that it's crossing a line that shouldn't be crossed, whether with a toe or with the whole body.</div>

    <div class="md">Just came across the sub for the first time today and found a pretty upvoted comment saying that "guys today would downplay rape cases, or say 'she was asking for it!'" I thought it was pretty jarring, since the wording made it sound like they were trying to say men in general, or all/most men which is obviously sexist. Their following (also pretty upvoted) post talked about how they thought that guys have created a culture that would end society, and how men cheat more than women statistically. 

They then later (rather aggressively) stated that they had obviously not meant all women, but it could have been worded better IMO. Overall the whole thing just seemed kinda skirting the line of sexism, but aggressively denying it? It was weird.</div>

    <div class="md">You use “man” like a title, same for “woman.” like the lowly woman dares insult me?! You're clutching pearls right now, grandma. You have the option of being the bigger person, and you're arguing for the vibration to make the more toxic decision to verbally abuse someone. It’s a stupid argument to make. Two wrongs don't make a right.</div>

    <div class="md">Uhh no not really, i’m saying if someone insults you, you have the right to insult them back, regardless of gender or race.

I understand it’s not the bigger thing to do, but it should be something you are allowed to do. Not all of us can be self-sacrificing heroes like yourself.</div>

Is this the comment you were banned over? Because that comment makes it pretty clear you were there in bad faith and in breach of a few of that community's rules. 

Fucked around, found out.</div>
