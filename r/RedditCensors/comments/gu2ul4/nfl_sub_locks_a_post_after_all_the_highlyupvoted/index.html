    <div class="md">If you read the thread, you'll notice that everyone gave great reasons as to why Kap was never signed back on an NFL team

- he supported Castro while in Miami, a place Cubans found as refuge from the Cuban tyranny
- His girlfriend called out Ray Lewis as a slave to the teams owner, while Baltimore was ready to offer him a contract
- He didnt even vote in 2016
- Eric Reid (and a bunch of other players) knelt and were still signed, so it wasnt just the kneeling
- He also slept with a teammates girlfriend who then became his girlfriend.
- He wouldnt take a 1-year contract with incentives
- He wore socks depicting cops as pigs 2 months after the targeted cop assassination in Dallas
- Support communism (Che Guevera shirt)
- "And had no problem cashing in on his activism by inking a multimillion dollar deal with Nike, a paragon of social justice who just happens to have a massive uniform deal with the very organization he accuses of being a bunch of racist slave owners." ..sho also run sweat shops
- He tried to get traded before he ever knelt, and only 2 teams were interested
- Said this "I warned you the #7torms Coming" right after the hurricane hit (his number was 7)
- Incoming rookie QB's with a similar skillset that would be cheaper/less headache
- Turned down the Broncos contract


Every reason is laid out, but it made Kap look like bad, so the thread had to get locked</div>

    <div class="md">In his last year he had a game where he played 3 quarters and only had 5 yards passing, a new record low.

His stats for the year looked OK , but it was mostly from stat padding when the Niners were down by 2 or more scores. Lots of short passes versus soft coverage.</div>

    <div class="md">Hilarious. The whole stupid "take a knee" bullshit is what he did to desperately grab for another 15 min of fame in his plane wreck of a career. 

His career was already down the toilet. 

This being pointed out is probably why they locked the thread. Didn't fit their narrative?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not a mod there, but I do work with them and there's no narrative.

There's no big conspiracy.

The subreddit is a pain in the fucking ass to moderate. I was asked to do it early on and said "no thanks" because it's a terrible job. 

The people who comment there are like YouTube-level commenters and about the only thing the mods agree on is that they don't want the admins up in their shit. You saw what they did to T_D. 

I will also add that the sub and even some of the mods are more to the right than the left. Sports are competitive. They're not filled with bleeding heart liberals like myself, it's mostly people who eat their steak raw with their bayonet while listening to Sousa marches.</div>

    <div class="md">The sub is currently locked with this message:

&gt;Reddit has harbored racists as policy for years /u/spez. It has led to battling racism constantly, increased by the kneeling that encompassed Black Lives Matter’s message. We are closing for 24 hours with these requests:

&gt;A reddit policy against bigotry,

&gt;Deplatforming heavy participants in hate subreddits through their main account and alts,

&gt;A way to report subreddits based on the content of their sub, and

&gt;If these cannot be met, we call for the resignation of Reddit leadership.

&gt;Thank you

How fucking insufferable these bleeding hearts are.</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit is cool and all for being a progressive site and all that, but it reeeeeally forces certain narratives. Combine locked threads with the upvote/downvote system and you get a pretty insane echo chamber of a website. It's frustrating</div>
