As an unarmed black person you have a 9 in 10 million chance of being killed by a cop during an arrest. You have a 1 in 700,000 chance of being struck by lightning. So as an unarmed black person, it is 58% more likely you'd be struck by lightning than it is you'd be killed during an arrest! And that's only narrowing down to when an arrest situation happened already let alone an innocent black person going about their lives! So if a fear of lightning is considered an irrational fear, then a black person's fear of police during an arrest is an even more irrational fear that we should be teaching them is irrational, not creating a problem that isn't there.

All you IGNORANT people downvoting just because it doesn't fit your agenda at least provide some evidence for your side. The evidence DOES NOT support or justify these protests or the extreme actions that are being discussed as a response of these protests (such as defunding police, etc.) DON'T let the media divide us and make racism an issue when it's NOT. There is only ONE race, the HUMAN race.</div>

    <div class="md">That's true, but first of all either way the numbers for all races are so insignificant that it's really not an issue either way. Second, and this is actually the statistic that would get you the most backlash and accused as racist, but it's also a fact that black people commit a disproportionate amount of legitimate crimes. Now I'm not saying it's due to their race. There are more factors in place such the culture in some communities praising attacking cops or all the gangsta mentalities in their songs as well as poverty. But either way it's a fact that they commit a disproportionate amount of crimes so naturally the stats would reflect that. Like I said that's not a racist thing to point out there are legitimate reasons for it such as culture/poverty.</div>

    <div class="md">Much lower when you consider the representation in violent crime statistics.

The fact of the matter is that if you are killed as a black person, the LEAST likely person to have killed you is a cop, of any color, much less a white one.

This does not excuse police brutality.  It does not matter that George Floyd was a bad person, or that he was resisting arrest.  The cop was on his neck with his full weight.  We all saw it.  That simply can NOT be allowed.

There ARE criminals that have managed to obtain a badge.  That also can not be allowed.  In fact, I would suggest that someone with a badge be held to a higher standard when it comes to them committing crimes.

But the narrative being built that cops are out hunting down and killing black men is a complete lie, and it's a lie they are desperate to keep from being exposed.  They will try to silence anyone who challenges it.</div>

    <div class="md">I run into this b.s. cherry picking on Facebook all the time, but I rarely see it on Reddit, because the algorithm usually doesn't let it float to my page.

I'll start by saying, there are a LOT more deaths from Police brutality than just those caused by shootings. George Floyd is the perfect example of this.  You are making a case out of obviously incomplete data, by acting as though what you are saying is exactingly correct when it's not.

Out of about 600,000 Cops in the US, there are 85,000 known investigations of Cops for a range of misconduct.

" Officers have beaten members of the public, planted evidence and used  their badges to harass women. They have lied, stolen, dealt drugs,  driven drunk and abused their spouses. "

[https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/usa-today-revealing-misconduct-records-police-cops/3223984002/)

There are 30,000 Cops who are banned from being Police in 44 States for the previously mentioned misconduct.

[https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/biggest-collection-police-accountability-records-ever-assembled/2299127002/](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2019/04/24/biggest-collection-police-accountability-records-ever-assembled/2299127002/)

You can take limited, inaccurate, misreported numbers and use them to paint the picture you want, but you're just lying by cherry picking grossly incomplete statistics. What you have presented in no way represents the risk of life and limb POC face. False arrest, planting evidence, violence, rape, and continual harassment are some of the ways that the Police attack minorities. NY's Stop and Frisk is an excellent example of the skewed harassment of minorities and the poor.

You're lying.  


Edit: This misconduct would encompass nearly 20% of Cops with the two numbers combined. So about 1 in 5 Cops are Known to abuse the public in some way. This doesn't account for unreported and undetected crime, which would likely push the ratio of rotten cops higher.</div>

    <div class="md">First of all if you claim I'm lying by cherry picking, you also are lying because you made it a point to mention how there are 85,000 out of 600,000 who were "INVESTIGATED" for misconduct, even though your article mentions that "most" misconduct are minor infractions, and of note are "22,924 investigations of officers using excessive force, 3,145 allegations of rape, child molestation and other sexual misconduct and 2,307 cases of domestic violence by officers." Of those considering the same police officers might be responsible for many of them let's say the cases worth mentioning narrow the investigations into 25000 officers. The fact that it mentions investigations means that they were accused of something which doesn't necessarily mean they were actually guilty of it. The unfortunate reality is that we don't know what amount of those are justified, how many of those were against what racial groups, etc. While the database can be searched, you can't expect me to search 200,000 alleged incidents and create a summarized statistics from it...</div>

    <div class="md">Racism is an issue, but not a systemic issue, and the facts/laws prove that it's not a systemic issue. Obviously there are some people, some even might be police, with insane racist ideas that could potentially have been the root cause of what happened to Floyd for example. What happened to Floyd was wrong. No one is saying it wasn't. The thing I disagree with is that it's a systemic issue and that we need to do insane things like defund police and blame all police for what one tiny group of cops did. Those cops need to be arrested for 1st/2nd degree murder and we should continue handling these situations when they come up, but you can't fight a ghost that doesn't exist such as "systemic racism".</div>

    <div class="md">But systematic racism is a thing, and it isn’t a ghost. Most people aren’t protesting for defunding the police just reforming it since the current system was founded in racist ideals. There is also hundreds of stories of the current police system not helping people who really needed them like abusive victims. It’s also not just George Floyd it’s tons of others.</div>

    <div class="md">If you are to say that systemic racism is a thing, our "system" is our judicial system, or in other words, the laws. Can you name a single racist law we still have? If so, I'll be there right with you to go to congress and ask them to change that law... But to suggest that what individual people do reflects the entire group they belong in is the same exact logic that racism is...

Also, take for example the situation for Floyd. In my mind, what they did does NOT stand for the principles of being a cop, and I consider it to be the equivalent of a dishonorable discharge from the military where they need to turn in their badge and uniform. They are NOT cops, they are animals who were in a cop's uniform, which is why they were stripped of their badge and arrested. No one is defending them. Cops aren't defending them. 99.9% of cops probably completely agree that they should be arrested for murder, so why are those same cops being mistreated by protesters in their 12 hour shifts trying to keep the peace?</div>

    <div class="md">The system is not just the judicial system, it is everything else too. It is how security guards in shops will follow them even though they have done nothing, etc. “we still have” that’s the problem, just because we don’t have them doesn’t mean they never existed, at one point it was illegal for slaves to run away and slavery was legal. 
It’s also not just the individual people it is the system, sure there is good cops, but the system unfortunately enables the bad ones so they often get away without punishment. 
They were arrested yes, but they weren’t arrested immediately and they likely wouldn’t have been arrested at all if it hadn’t been caught on video and gained mass attention. Is this okay? 
Just like how the police lied about what happened to the rolex watch shop. The police claimed that looters stole $2.4 million worth of watches but rolex came forward to say that there was nothing in the store. Is this okay? 
Trying to keep the peace? that’s not correct. Most of the riots have either been started by the police or started because of the police. And personally i don’t think rubber bullets are something that should be used on protestors no matter how much trouble they are causing. 
And what about the many innocent people who’ve been caught up? They’ve all been targeted by the police in some way, directly or indirectly. Is this okay?</div>

    <div class="md">It's not that I don't sympathize if such situations happen or doubt that they happen, it's that there's no concrete system to link them to. You can't unjustly assume that what some security guards do link to all security guards. You can't unjustly assume that what one cop does reflects on all cops. That's what I meant when I said that the concept of systemic racism is a ghost. There's nothing concrete. The only way you can fight it is to fight the concrete individual cases as they happen, such as making police wear body cams and filming situations like what happened to Floyd as they happen.</div>

    <div class="md">But why should they have to be filmed ? surely the bad ones should be weeded out well before they’re ever allowed to start doing actual work. But it’s not unjust, but it’s also not all security guards it’s just that it’s happened to so many people that it is a problem. 
That’s not the only way, for one why aren’t the cops taught de-escalation techniques, or why it shouldn’t be shoot first questions later. 
And the reason it is systematic racism is that POC are usually targeted or profiled even though they’ve done nothing wrong. There’s also the fact that POC tend to get longer sentences for the same crimes as white people which is systematic racism since it is the system.</div>
