Lt Byrd was stationed there and defending federal property. As well as having rational fear considering police had already been severely injured(and murdered).</div>

He was chased and had to resort to self defence after someone else shot first. You need to understand that he tried running from the violence, but they CHASED HIM!</div>

    <div class="md">He didn't live in that area and had no reason to go there and "defend" it. He wasn't even legally allowed to have that rifle. He was running around lying about his expertise claiming he was an EMT. Then goes somewhere he knows is confrontational with an illegal and loaded rifle and you expect me to think he didn't want confrontation? He literally said people are getting injured and his job is to defend the business. Literally putting profit over actual lives. Then the police made him leave that dealership because of his behavior. Then at another location he hears gunshots and panics like the snowflake he is and fires his gun. Then when people feel they are in danger and need to defend themselves this guy is a hero? Your brain is fried on Fox and Sinclair.</div>

    <div class="md">What part of he WORKED THERE do you not understand? he lived a short while away and computed there for work. As for the gun it is not as open and closed as that and it might have been legal. As for the rest, total BS.

&gt;Then at another location he hears gunshots and panics like the snowflake he is and fires his gun.

He was running away from people chasing him and heard a gunshot as if somebody was shooting AT him and defended himself. You clearly do not understand the case.</div>

    <div class="md">He didn't work there. He had seen online the owner was looking for help defending the business and he and his friend Dominick armed themselves and just went. Unless you have some secret private source that no one else even in media has then that gun was definitely illegal. The guy who sold it to him was arrested as well. The first guy he killed was unarmed and trying to disarm him after he fired in panic. He shot the guy four times. Does that seem reasonable to you? If he had stayed his trigger-finger-happy-ass at home 2 people would still be alive and another uninjured. Other people were armed yet Kyle wasn't shot or shot at. Probably because he was the aggressor.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;At the first location, Rittenhouse was pursued by a group, a gunshot was fired into the air by a third party, and Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum lunged at Rittenhouse and attempted to take his rifle. Rittenhouse then fired four times at Rosenbaum, who died shortly afterwards.


&gt;West Allis resident Gaige Grosskreutz then approached Rittenhouse while holding a handgun, and Rittenhouse shot him once, severing his bicep.


&gt;Rittenhouse was arrested and charged with multiple counts of homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm, and another teen was arrested and charged with unlawfully supplying Rittenhouse's rifle.


&gt;Kevin Mathewson announced the formation of a militia group he called the Kenosha Guard. On August 25, he put out a call on Facebook for "patriots willing to take up arms and defend" Kenosha, which received a heavy online response.[23] Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian and County Sheriff David Beth expressed their disapproval of armed civilians patrolling the streets


&gt;Sheriff Beth later said that ahead of Tuesday night's protests, a group of armed individuals had asked him to deputize them so they could patrol the city of Kenosha, which he refused. He said he did not know if Rittenhouse had been part of the group, but the possibility of an incident occurring was why he had refused the request.

(I do not believe Rittenhouse was part of this group I'm mentioning this so you know the city and state did not want people like Rittenhouse armed and patrolling their city.)


&gt;According to his attorneys, after Rittenhouse had heard about a local business owner who wanted help defending his car dealership, he and his friend Dominick David Black "armed themselves with rifles" and went to that business.

&gt;He went to a riot where he does not live, with an illegal gun and the intention of confronting people.

No different than saying a home owner should have left their house instead of defend it to keep the criminals alive.

The people who attacked a guy with a gun shouldn't have done so.

But you already know all this; you're just an idiot.</div>

    <div class="md">No because he's perpetuating the crime. He's the rapist in your analogy. So yeah if the rapist or home invader stayed home there would be no crime being committed. 

Your problem is that you don't see unarmed citizens on public property being shot to death as a crime unless they had the same political ideals.

    <div class="md">He didn't perpetrate any crime.

Someone tried to grab his gun, hit him with a skateboard, and pointed a pistol at him.

Those were the people he shot.

He's 17 and it's legal for him to carry a gun in the state (usually associated with hunting).

He's not able to buy it himself.

Imagine defending the adults attacking a minor.

You're a complete POS; upset that a minor wasn't victimized.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm upset he killed 2 people and had no business bringing a rifle to a city he didn't live. The fact that you have to find arbitrary arguments like: he's allowed to have a gun or whether it was legal for him to purchase it. Shows just how much you actually care about the facts rather ~~rather~~ *than your opinion of the people he shot. Then putting words in my mouth to make your argument valid when that's not my position at all. 2 people are dead and he is at fault. Whether you like it or not is irrelevant; it's reality.

The first guy he shot was trying to disarm him. After Kyle had fired his rifle in the middle of a crowd. Kyle shot him 4 times. That doesn't seem excessive to you? All the other people he shot were also trying to disarm him. Why didn't the guy with the handgun just shoot him?

We don't blame people for getting attacked because they happen to be in around shitty people and we certainly don't condemn them for defending themselves.

Three people attacked a man with a gun and lost - that's what happened.

We have case-closed clear footage of 2 incidents. The only one with any questions is the first incident.
