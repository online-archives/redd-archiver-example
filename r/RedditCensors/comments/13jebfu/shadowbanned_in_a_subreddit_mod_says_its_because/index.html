    <div class="md">My account is supposedly in the "ban evasion filter", yet I'm not banned from the sub. Neither are my alt accounts.

I asked the mods about it. They said there's nothing they can do. That I should message the admins to get the flag removed from my account.

I did just that, and the admin tells me that the mods are the ones that have control over the ban evasion filter. They would have to make the change. The admins cannot, even if the mods are telling me that they can.

I messaged the mods back, and they were rude and unhelpful. Basically telling me I'm shadowbanned for no reason. Probably because I don't fit the narrative they want. I understand it's a sub and the mods make the rules, but don't just lie and give me a copypasta response. Really goes to show their maturity.</div>

    <div class="md">A sub can shadowban you with their spambot scripts, and admins can shadowban you site-wide.  

Admins can also remove your comment without the mods of a sub getting any message about it, or option to approve and reinstate the comment.  This is the worst, as there's absolutely no recourse for either mods or the redditor.

If you're not seeing this shadowban anywhere else but the one sub though, then it's most likely the sub's spambot filter, not admin action.  Getting them to fix it, or even find out why you're getting caught, could be difficult though. At least the mod was honest about the level of energy they're willing to invest. :-/</div>
