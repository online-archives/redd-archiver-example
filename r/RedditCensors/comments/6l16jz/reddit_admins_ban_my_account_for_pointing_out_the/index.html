    <div class="md">Absolutely abhorrent, the hypocrisy displayed by admins.

It is allll too obvious that blatant vote manipulation has been going on for ages. They're not even bothering to be clever about it anymore.

And yes, admins are fully aware of shady propaganda outfits like ShareBlue here, and have been seen talking about them in off-site chat.

It's good to see more people waking up.  We need to keep pointing this out, as not everyone is aware of the extent of the cancer here.</div>

    <div class="md">What makes Reddit suck the most is organized groups of nerds who use persistent irc/slackchat and discord. Me, I am just one person arguing with my opinions, but on Reddit I have learned I am frequently battling large cliques of nerds organizing/brigading off of Reddit via persistent chat clients. I remember once on /r/anticonsumption I wrote how libraries shouldn't rent out video games or movies or something and like 4-5 librarians with no post history to that sub heckled, berated and downvoted me. But what are the chances so many librarians all stumbled on the same thread on a sub they never/rarely posted on? That is the story of this shithole, anything you write, a group or nerds and outcasts could descend from dank nerd persistent chat channels and heckle you and banish your posts below the viewing threshold. Of course when that happens often enough and you lash out, the nerd mods will ban you if go against their agenda and circlejerk. Paid corporate shilling is something I encounter much less, most often when you try to write against monsanto and gmos. Though shilling from political parties and personalities could be why certain subs like /r/politics made it impossible to support Donald trump leading the rise of /r/thedonald. But that is hard to tell without going onto their nerdy persistent chat channels, and one thing is certain Reddit's nerd moderator class sucks, they are intolerant, agenda pushing and have no lives. 

Honestly I have no respect for people who fit in on Reddit, because there is a reason they fit in here: because they cannot anywhere else. I never saw account with lots of karma and actually read the posts and thought they were worthwhile, mostly what is worth reading here can never get upvoted. </div>

    <div class="md">Wow I had no idea the roots of these hiveminds organized on IRC  (which is a cesspool in and of itself) and discord. Thank you for the insight. 

I too have had the same experiences with massive down votes, and dogpile comments which pop up in obscure subs and are exactly as you describe, low post history etc. 

I've achieved a moderate amount of karma over the 4 years I've been on Reddit, with the same account. Most of which has derived from niche' subs and a couple of epic posts I've made. You're absolutely right about karma gods not fitting in elsewhere.

    <div class="md">I noticed a while back I was massively being downvoted in /r/vegan(where I am now banned). Over time after clicking the userpages of the people heckling me I noticied that most the clique posted to the vile /r/vegancirclejerk sub. Aside: circlejerk subs are low quality shit and that type of loserdom was frowned on the pre-Reddit discussion medums. Eventually I noticied that circlejerk sub advertised their irc channel and lurked and found them discussing me numerous times and eventually the nerd ringleaders of that shit circlejerk sub and channel became /r/vegan mods. See for proof with screenshots:

    <div class="md">No, the reason you and I were both "permanently suspended" was because the archive link we posted contained some dude's personal information (full name, skype name, photo, linkedin profile and what university he's at). With that info you could almost certainly have garnered much more info about him too.

We probably would've been fine if we'd just directly linked to the thread that was eventually deleted, but we posted the archive.is link to it which is beyond reddit's control. They obviously had to do something to stop the doxing.

Am I gutted that I've lost my 5 year old account? Yes. Do I think it's a conspiracy or evidence of corrupt admins? No.</div>
