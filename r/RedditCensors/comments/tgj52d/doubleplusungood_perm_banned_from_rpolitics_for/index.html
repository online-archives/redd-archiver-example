    <div class="md">&gt;In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the perception of contradictory information. Relevant items of information include a person's actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, values, and things in the environment. Cognitive dissonance is typically experienced as psychological stress when persons participate in an action that goes against one or more of those things.[1] According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent.[1][2] The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort.[1][2][3]

&gt;In When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World (1956) and A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency to function mentally in the real world.[1] A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.[1][2] They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance (rationalization) or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance (confirmation bias).[1][2][3]

&gt;Coping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve the dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.

Apparently it's OK for every Leftist on /r/politics to call *everyone* they disagree with Nazis and other terrible things, but it's *not* OK to criticize Leftists on /r/politics for calling everyone they disagree with Nazis and other terrible things.</div>

    <div class="md">Count yourself lucky you got told why you’re being banned. All I got was a permaban and a link to my comment plus a boilerplate message of “tell us what rule you broke and why it’s important to follow that rule”. Then upon appeal they simply said the appeal got denied and I should check back in 3 months. Oh and they automodded the fuck out of my comments.

They just saw a new account who really, really disagreed with the subreddit’s views on various topics. Anything against the hivemind is low effort trolling. Shamelessly parroting the hivemind is high effort discussion.</div>

    <div class="md">What got me banned from /r/politics and my appeal which was denied:

MY APPEAL:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;For this appeal I am using a direct quote from President Joe Biden from his CNN Town Hall Meeting on October 21st 2021:  
&gt;  
&gt;**BIDEN:** I mean, so there's -- the idea is that -- look, the two things that concern me, one, are those who just try to make this a political issue -- freedom, **"I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID."**   (LAUGHTER)  No, I mean, come on... freedom.

That's what Biden said on CNN.

This is the comment that got me banned which I was not directing to anyone.  It was directed at the news article and it's headline.   This is the headline I commented on:

**Opinion | How Gov. Kristi Noem Rebranded Her Failures as ‘Freedom’**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;McNam77 1 yr. ago  
&gt;  
&gt;Free to drop dead before your time or get other innocent people dead.  
&gt;  
&gt;Enjoy!

**PERMANENTLY BANNED FOR WISHING DEATH ON PEOPLE!**</div>
