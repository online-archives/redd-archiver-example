      <div class="md">I posted 2 posts there the other day, one was being upvoted and the other looks like it may have been removed immediately by automod or not long after by a mod. If I documented all the subs previously that have removed my posts (either mods or automod algorithm) without explanation, I would fill entire pages here with posts, but I am trying to focus on most recent removals and mod abuse which I have encountered. Note: I am not trying to get censored or banned, I actually want to participate and contribute and be part of these communities. 

I wrote to the moderators: 

&gt;I posted https://np.reddit.com/r/WhatsWrongWithYourCat/comments/qpranz/how_you_doin/ and it looks to have been removed and I think this one was autoremoved by automod? https://np.reddit.com/r/WhatsWrongWithYourCat/comments/qprrf8/really/ Just curious why they were removed and if I could please get them approved if they are appropriate for this sub.

That was 2 days ago. I received no response.

I wrote them again:

&gt;Writing to you again to try to find out why my posts here: https://np.reddit.com/r/WhatsWrongWithYourCat/comments/qpranz/how_you_doin/ and here https://np.reddit.com/r/WhatsWrongWithYourCat/comments/qprrf8/really/ were removed.

A mod replied with:

&gt;I didn't do it. But I would guess it's because you are a karma farmer?

I replied with:

&gt;? I post stuff that I like that I come across, to appropriate subs. Karma is a perk, I do not post just to farm karma. There are also users with 5/10/20/30 million karma so It is not terribly hard to get karma these days. Reddit also promotes people to show off their karma and I don't think they support mods having prejudice against those who have a ton of karma. Why am I being punished for wanting to contribute? Could I please get my posts approved?

They responded with:

&gt;Again, it wasn't me that did it. I would suspect it falls under the spam guidelines.

I wrote back:

&gt;I believe you, but my point stands. Also, I fail to see how it would fall under spam, I posted 2 posts in a 24 hour period. I don't see anything in your sidebar against that, unless I am missing something? You should be able to see who removed them under moderation log. I don't know why you can't approve them. Did this mod need to talk to you to remove posts? Maybe they will respond and clarify how these removals aren't arbitrary and what rules I violated to warrant their removal?

And that was 18 hours ago and I have not heard back or had my posts reinstated. 

P.S. I have posted there before, at least 4 of my past posts are still up. Just like what happened over at r/autos.</div>

    <div class="md">So I can post to subs (mostly without issue) when I had less than a million karma but now my stuff is removed without explanation by mods and automod (despite reaching out to mods to resolve this issue) but that's on me because of my username? I don't think people should be punished for wanting to genuinely contribute or for their username.  I used this name before I came to reddit, it oddly enough has nothing to do with Reddit karma.

    <div class="md">&gt;Holy shit didn't even see you have 2 million karma! Removed by spam from what I know is either that video has been uploaded too many times with that same thumbnail each time or you have been doing some fishy automated bot posting using your account

How is it spam though and if both were removed due to being reposts, why not just say that? Fishing automated bot posting? See me on redditmetis (previously snoopsnoo) my heatmap* activity is not bot-like, because I am not a bot, neither am I a shill or troll. Again, there are accounts with 5/10/20/30+ million karma, why are people so suprised by an account with 2 million karma? Do you agree with mods having prejudice against and censoring accounts with a lot of karma and or due to where they post?</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Honestly I'm prejudiced against high karma accounts like yours, like why do you have so much karma. I find it hard to sympathize with you tbh because of that

Thank you for at least being honest but I don't agree with you. Censorship is still censorship regardless of how much karma a person has. To answer your question: I just post a lot (always have) and I guess I post some content that people like and I have been lucky to have some of my posts upvoted quite a bit, which certainly added to my karma count.</div>
