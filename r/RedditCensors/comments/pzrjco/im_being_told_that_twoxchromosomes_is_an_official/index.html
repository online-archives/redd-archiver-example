    <div class="md">The "White race" was born of exclusion. Europeans settling the Americas were caught between the brown Natives and African slaves. The concept of whiteness helped to write laws and regulations excluding the Natives and Africans from enjoying the same rights. For example in Britain there were many races: Anglo-Saxons, Norse, Scots, Celts. And many more but those are just off the top off my head. Yet here European Christian men all started to identify as white. Regardless of the fact that some are olive skinned while others have more of a pink hue or pale skin, and a whole spectrum of cultures. Slowly over time more and more different nationalities are being considered white. Everyone's heard of the Irish being discriminated against when they first came to the US, and now Hispanics are being considered white by more and more people.


Other races however, as whiteness is born of exclusion, were born of inclusion. For example to ensure complete subjugation of slaves they forced them to become Christian/Catholic and to speak English/Spanish. Then separated families so tradition could not be passed along. Doing this erased almost all of the culture that was brought from their homelands and forced an entire people to adapt. During this time of cultural erasure the people began their own cultures. Black and Latino cultures developed to connect people that didn't have history anymore. Most black Americans don't know their nationality and that's where Black pride comes in. Despite not having that history having the right to be proud of your people.

TL;DR: Race is a replacement for not knowing your nationality. If you're "White" statistically you know your ancestors nationality and should identify as that.</div>

why do you ask? do you have something against people of lower intellect? or, on the other hand, if I've done bad in school, how do you know it wasn't because of socioeconomic factors? funny that you mention it since "minorities" don't seem to do that well in school in america.

It seems you are a little bigot yourself, huh?</div>

    <div class="md">a group of people sharing the same culture, history, language, etc.; an ethnic group.

"we Scots were a bloodthirsty race then"

So yeah not really dependant on the color of your skin considering how wide of a range of complexions are within each race. 

The Black race is different from the white race because of ancestral knowledge. Black Americans have very little knowledge of their ancestry thanks to the way they got to the US. So its very rare to be able to say, "I'm Nigerian or Zimbabwean." Especially considering the countries around back then had vastly different borders and names.

However most "white" Americans can identify nearly exactly the percentage of what nationalities they are. Those nationalities are your culture. White has no culture because it was made up. The concept of whiteness came about before the country was even established as a way to distinguish between punishments for Natives, Slaves, and Settlers. Can you guess which of those three groups represent white? "Neither shall, at any time, whip a christian white servant naked...to whip a christian white servant naked, without such order, the person so offending, shall forfeit and pay for the same, forty shillings sterling to the party injured."

https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-concerning-servants-and-slaves-1705/

They used "white" as a substitute for power. As more immigrants came to America, the "White" Christian men were getting outnumbered. Aka losing power. So what do they do? Irish are white now. Then Civil rights movements happen. Lose more power? Italians are white now. BLM in 2020? Hispanics are white now.

Black culture has developed not just in what I describe to fill a void in culture. It exists today because of a shared experience. No fair skinned European, even those descendants of slaves have a similar shared experience. Slavery in America was unique in that it was race based. No matter what if you were Black in America you were a slave. No other society has ever done what we did in the way of slavery, not even the Roman's slavery was based on race.</div>

    <div class="md">Did you see the post on reddit.com/r/all or reddit.com? The former includes all* subreddits while the latter only shows the ones you're subscribed to. It's possible you're not actually subscribed to them. Actually you can just visit /r/TwoXChromosomes and see if the button on the side says "join" or "leave" to see if you're subscribed.

*Technically not all subreddits, they exclude certain "undesirable" communities chosen by the admins.</div>

    <div class="md">I definitely was subscribed to 10-30 subreddits automatically when i created my account a couple days ago. go make one yourself and i’m sure it’ll happen to you as well. report back if it doesn’t, because then perhaps it’s different between the countries we live in (some of the auto subscriptions are regional)</div>

    <div class="md">Just tried it, after account creation I was prompted to subscribe but didn't.

Then the browser redirected to /r/popular (includes non-subscribed subreddits, like /r/all).

If I view the front page for my subscribed content (reddit.com) I see zero posts.

    <div class="md">No worries.

Incidentally, I found this while trying to find possible reasons for default subscriptions:

https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/an77rk/brand_new_reddit_account_is_already_subbed_to/

A reply claims that Reddit automatically subscribes new accounts to subreddits recently visited in that browser. I used incognito, so it possibly explains why I have no cookies for Reddit to use and thus no initial subscriptions.</div>

    <div class="md">That’s 10000000% not the case for me. Everyone here has for the last couple of years and continue to this day to be subscribed automatically to the default subreddits including the region specific ones. 

Whoever made that claim was lying. 

Like I said, try using a VPN.</div>

    <div class="md">I think they're thinking of "default subreddit" which no longer exists. It used to be that when you joined reddit you were automatically subbed to a bunch of subreddits of the admins choosing. That ended in 2017 officially but im sure various admins throw their weight around to keep certain subs active and controlled.</div>
