https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalVideo/comments/qg4ai1/fauci_roasted_over_barbaric_nihfunded_puppy/

https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalVideo/comments/qfwqbu/faucis_lies_exposed_obamas_crumbs_bill_gates/

The 2nd was of a live show, which is why the link is broken.

Just some backstory: I have had users (5 or 6 of them) from politicalvideo, follow me to other subs across reddit, commenting in my posts in multiple subs, accusing me of spreading disinformation and being a Russian agent/troll and Trump supporter. These same users have time and time again replied to my posts in politicalvideo with ad homs, personal attacks, lazy oppo research (you might expect from a political or pro war group or 'think tank' to smear leftist anti-establishment anti-imperialism journalists/activists/content creators, and posters of said content). Incessantly engaging in the same fallacious debate. Spamming the same links in multiple threads of mine. Even one particular user - who responds to just about every one of my posts - has replied to comments of mine up to 4 times on multiple occasions. I reported these users on at least a few different occasions for their troll accusations, spamming links at me and following me around Reddit and nothing came from it! 

More backstory: I have been contributing to that sub for at least a year and pretty regularly, despite seeing my posts frequently downvoted and often just minutes after posting them. 

And this message was in my inbox:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/PoliticalVideo. You can still view and subscribe to r/PoliticalVideo, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/PoliticalVideo by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

I responded with: 

&gt;Can I ask why I've been permanently banned from this sub?

No response. I replied again with: 

&gt;You have users who spam my posts, spam links in my posts and call me a troll/grifter/Russian asset etc on the regular and I have reported them (there are multiple users here that do that and I have reported them numerous times for rule violations) you have NEVER done anything about that, they all continue posting here unabated. Now you take action when I do what they do to me and get away with? Will you also now ban these users for their personal attacks and troll accusations that came before mine? Will you ban this other user here for posting more to this sub than I do? Just curious why you never took action before and wondering if you will treat these users as you are now treating me or will this be another case of selective rule enforcement?

No reply. Mods there appear not to care about users who call others trolls/Russian agents, make innuendoes (comrades/rubes) and instigate people like myself to bite back with troll accusations towards those endlessly engaging in fallacious debate and ad homs/troll accusations on the daily, just as long as they are pushing (hyper)partisan hack manufacturing consent propaganda (and disinformation) for the dem party (aka correcting the record) and or security state and NATO, which is A-okay, while my wrongthink is 'problematic' and ban-worthy. These users get a free pass. They bait/annoy people, report them, then probably get off to these people being banned.</div>

    <div class="md">Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

OP would constantly spam the same few sources, Jimmy Dore, Grayzone, Russel Brand, etc.... and never engage when misinformation and/or outright lies were brought up.  Simply resort to saying they are a "paid troll", part of a secret group there to harras them, or scream "projection" instead of having a meaningful debate.

Claims to be progressive but refuses to ever utter a single negative word related to Trump or his cronies other than it was entirely the Democrats fault.

If anyone questions why OP was banned, just check OP's post history after reading my description.

Have a nice day.</div>
