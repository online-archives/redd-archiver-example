Why do you keep pretending like the "eat shit" part is what you were banned for lol

I support your actions, its just obviously a bannable offense to make a post calling for everyone on a sub to go die. Why did you let yourself be silenced so easily by using violent rhetoric? Next time be civil as you systematically berate them.</div>

    <div class="md">They werent banned from Reddit, they were banned from one apparently racist sub. You expect nazis to have a fair sense of time for bans?

Why are you guys even engaging with them? Thats part of reddit. You can easily avoid the places that suck but instead it appears that you guys were seeking conflict. The mods there fixed that, as shitty as they may be.</div>

    <div class="md">bro are you really gonna just expect people to not notice the "and die" part? also, you were banned for violent content, not harassment. even without seeing any of your other posts, i just KNOW this is regular behavior for you.

    <div class="md">for you idiots that continue saying it was his fault, just take a look at the sub, go there and say "trans rights", you will receive:

harassment

death threats

multiple cucks telling you to kys

probably a redditcareresources message

a ban and mute on the sub

&amp;#x200B;

and if you tell them to go fuck themselves, you get mass reported until reddit suspends your account, is that fair? i dont think so, go touch grass smh.</div>
