    <div class="md">You just told me to "Grow the fuck up". That is attacking me. And you still have not clarified my question. It is quite obvious that you are not a victim in this and that you did not make the "joke" clear that it was a joke. As such it was taken for what it should have been taken. Next time make it clear if a joke is a joke. I personally do not find "The children should be beaten" as a joke. I could have probably taken that you were joking if you had clearly stated as such.

For example. "The children should be beaten /s" or "The children should be beaten. (this is a joke)".</div>

    <div class="md">I don't know why this is a hill you are choosing to die on. I have made it abundantly clear in what I meant. You, at this point, know what I meant. So let me dumb it down for you. I had asked you on what you had said exactly in the comment that got you banned. You have never answered it. You instead, insulted me, twice over at this point. 

I wasn't asking you to explain your "joke". I even advised you what to do in the future to reduce the chances of you getting banned on other subreddits. Your thinking that you don't have to make a "joke" in text abundantly clear that it was a joke is stupid, naive, and ignorant thinking. We cannot hear the infliction of the rather small voice in your head through text. The fact that you seem to not get this brings about the question of whether or not you have brain cell to use.

Due to your extremely childish non-joke and outlook, the one who has to grow up is you. I have tried to be civil in this discussion. I will not be engaging with you again. I hope you can actually learn something from this and better yourself for the future.</div>
