    <div class="md">They never warned me to stop posting, I'm not sure where you're getting that from, they just banned me out of the blue. The only thing they mentioned was to not post politics a few back when one linked was removed,  so I quit posting articles that were about politics from there on.  That entire conversation took place after I was banned. I asked him to show that I was spamming and when he actually looked, I wasn't even close to a "spamming " rate. The only rule he could find to apply to me was that it's spam to post *affiliated* content. I have no affiliation with babylonbee. I simply stumbled across the site and wanted to share their content. I did so well within any rules of spamming. </div>

    <div class="md">So how can I prove I'm not affiliated? I know I'm not but you all are accusing and assuming with no other evidence than the fact that I posted 5 articles from the same place. It's pretty frustrating to be accused and punished  for something I know I didn't do. Especially when it's from nothing more than circumstantial evidence. 

You can see I've never posted from that site from more than 12 days ago. Non of my other content, comments, or activity has any relation to them,even though I've had an account for a few years now, and babylonbee has been around for a few years as well. I only recently discovered them.  You can also see they've had articles posted in the past by plenty of other people, some of them being relatively popular. </div>
