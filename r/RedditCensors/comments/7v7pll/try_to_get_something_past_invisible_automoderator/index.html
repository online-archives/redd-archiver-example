But not on shithole Reddit! You don't even know if your post didn't show up for everyone else unless you are paranoid enough to log-out or check ceddit.com! And even then you have no idea what prevented it from being posted! I honestly think most filthy casual Redditors are too stupid to even figure out that posts like the one I cited from my post history -- also exist in their own post history, they never truly got posted and they don't even know it... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tl;dr:    
Once again I wrote a comment that I suspected was not visible to other users, so I checked ceddit.com and it was not being posted. I have no idea what triggered the automod or some other bot to remove it as on this shithole medium you are never informed that your post doesn't show up or told why it didn't pass some invisible filter! This has to happen to millions or tens of millions of wasted posts a day. Why does the Reddit luserbase accept such abuse? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I saw some Greek idiot /u/tzuridis make a typical low-quality, plain wrong and stupid post with the typical nonsense myth most Greeks were taught in school and popular culture that the "Greek junta regime of the Colonels was created and supported by the CIA":   

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7u6rtz/til_cocacola_was_accused_of_hiring_hitmen_from_a/dtihru8/

&gt;Greece as well supposedly since the dictator Giorgos Papadopoulos went back and forth to America for 8 years for "military training" and it was leaked who his CIA handler was, John Fatseas. Everything else is classified.

&gt;Maybe not entirely America's fault, they "might" have put him there but they more than likely lost control of him after a while which is why there was another coup at the end.

So I spent a very long time writing a reply and giving numerous sources, 1)a Greek print book, 2)a FOIA CIA document, 3)an archived Times Magazine article, 4)I showed that Google had no search results for the fictional CIA handler he made up, etc. I even could have given sources how the Greek junta refused to help resupply Israel in the Yom Kippur War, greatly angering Washington -- but the post was already too long for idiot Reddit attention spans. But it all didn't matter because my well written reply never got past the automod or some bot or whatever. Of course as usual I was never notified, I had to check ceddit.com to even see the post never showed up! Which is typical on this shithole where they shadow delete or shadow ban so often. So I still have no idea why the post never even showed up and of course no one on Reddit even cares -- not the admins and certainly not mods that millions of post just never make it past invisible filters we are not entitled to even know about!

Here is the comment I labored so hard to write and get posted:   

&gt;Where do you get this shit? Marios L. Euruviades informs us in the introduction page 33 of Τα μυστικά αρχεία του Κίσιντζερ Η απόφαση για τη διχοτόμηση, that once again researchers of modern Greek history were forced to use foreign archives to construct Greek history. He notes that with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Law 2594/1998, the Department of Historical Archives should release the relevant documents for 1974. But he poses the question if it will happen, are we in a position for it to ever happen? Meanwhile the author of that work, Michailis Ignatiou relied on American archives since in banana-istan Greece and Cyprus -- they will never release anything to threaten the putrid lies created by successive Greek governments to protect Greek democracy from their lies about the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.  The USA has the freedom of information act and older government documents are regularly declassified unlike in gerontocratic, clientilistic Greece where it cannot happen because it would have lead to the eventual collapse of the metapoltifesi political order. 

&gt;&gt;John Fatseas

&gt;Google search for his name and CIA, no positive results:   
https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;ei=LGN1Wu7WEsvm5gLtoqHYCA&amp;q=John+Fatseas+cia&amp;oq=John+Fatseas+cia&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.3201.140693.0.143256.4.4.0.0.0.0.104.379.2j2.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.3.302....0.H9UOrmjrNZ8

&gt;Add Papadopoulos still no results:   
&gt;https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;ei=v2N1Wte8Mczb5gKF8p-IAg&amp;q=John+Fatseas+papadopoulos+cia&amp;oq=John+Fatseas+papadopoulos+cia&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...57402.61879.0.62399.15.14.1.0.0.0.188.1233.12j2.14.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.1.188...0.0.nXvJ0ZEdKU4

&gt;Further here is a released FOIA CIA document showing the gripes of the Colonel's regime in Greece against the USA which were about their lack of recognition from Washington! Hardly what a puppet, client state would complain about:  

&gt;&gt;CIA Intelligence Memorandum    
&gt;&gt; 19 January 1968   

&gt;&gt;... Papadopoulos, irritated by the lack of US recognition, is reported to have said that if so-ne sign of recognition were not forthcoming byanuary, he would show the Americans that "we mean business." He did not specify what action he had in mind. ...

&gt;&gt;...

&gt;&gt;The Regime'3 Frustration in Its Foreign Relations

&gt;&gt;Since the junta took power last April, its principal problem has been with its allies. The open disapproval of the military regime by some NATO governments and the grudging acceptance by others have produced an increasing sense of Possibly in response to this adversefrom its friends, the government has moved toew constitution, which at least in its initial form retains the basic institutionsonstitutional monarchy. Further, the regime has declared it willational referendum as soon as practical before IS September. Soon after the King's abortive attempt to oust the junta, the regime released its most prominent detainee, Andreas Papandreou, presumably to satisfy some of itscritics.

&gt;&gt;Source:      
&gt;&gt;Poor OCR I used:    http://www.faqs.org/cia/docs/68/0000227065/THE-GREEK-JUNTA:-ITS-PROBLEMS-AND-PROSPECTS.html        
&gt;&gt;Original:   https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000227065.pdf

&gt;Further at the time of the Greek junta, a Greek American was Nixon's Vice President, Spiro Agnew and even he was pissed off as he wanted to visit his family in Greece but he couldn't because of America's cold shoulder to the junta!  He finally visited Greece but only as a private citizen!  

&gt;&gt;[Time Magazine: Monday, Nov. 01, 1971](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905466,00.html)     
&gt;Ever since he became Vice President of the United States, the son of Theofrastes Anagnostopoulos had yearned to pay an official visit to his family homeland in the hills of southern Greece. There was only one hitch. The country had been taken over in 1967 by right-wing army officers, headed by Colonel George Papadopoulos, who had ousted Parliament, canceled the constitution and subjected a number of political opponents to imprisonment and torture. Last July, when the fiercely anti-Communist officers showed no signs of restoring democratic government soon, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to cut off all military aid unless President Nixon declared that it was necessary to U.S. interests. While Nixon pondered that prospect—the Senate has yet to act on the proposal—Colonel Papadopoulos, now Premier, spoke bitterly about American criticism of a faithful NATO ally. Spiro Agnew still wanted to visit the homeland.

&gt;&gt;Finally, he did—thus becoming the first top-ranking Western leader to set foot in Greece since the 1967 coup. Officially, there was to be no endorsement of the junta, just a discussion of "NATO matters." Unofficially, Agnew would visit his ancestral home as a private citizen. But when his olive-drab helicopter settled down at Gargalianoi (pop. 6,200), one day last week, Agnew saw the streets lined with some 60,000 cheering peasants who had come on foot and by donkey and chartered bus from miles around. At Agnew's side, his head reaching only to Agnew's shoulder, stood Premier Papadopoulos.    

&gt;But continue with your funny metapoltifesi idiocies about the CIA behind every action in Greece, the CIA supporting the Greek junta and anti-junta myths! 

I realized that asshole mods or automod could have censored it for using the word "shit" and "idiocies", but I edited it and tried to post the same post twice more(3 times total) but none of them showed up according to ceddit. I swear I wonder why I bother with this place: 1) between the idiot userbase, 2) the asshole ultra-nerd mods who only are mods because they camp out in persistent chat 24/7 who are only concerned with enforcing "right speech", pushing their agenda and their constant hunt for micro-aggressions and 3) all the fucking bots and automod fuckery and censorship.

    <div class="md">I think this sub focuses too much on bitching about petty actions of one mod or group of mods, or sub and ignores the structural issues that make Reddit a shithole. There must be millions or tens of millions of posts a day that are shadow deleted like the post I cited above. Further, I think most Redditards don't even have the awareness to know it is happening -- to them it is just another post that for some reason didn't get a response. In this case it because the default automod, a custom automod setting or some bot deleted it so some nerdy moderators can feel good about their useless lives. Most Reddit neckbeard mods seem to think that the more moderator actions they commit the greater the good they are doing and somehow they are making their subs better, so to them when automod and/or bots delete hordes of posts for frivolous reasons it is a great development...

    <div class="md">OMG! You are so right. I just tried to post that site in reply to your post and it never showed up. Even on ceddit you can only see a post was    
&gt;[censored within 2 seconds]

See:  
https://www.ceddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/7v7pll/try_to_get_something_past_invisible_automoderator/

But that is not such a good example, therightstuffdotbiz is a shitty and niche site. Do you know a better example that is widely popular and actually has useful content, that can never get past the Reddit spam filter? 

**The worst thing though is that millions of users are wasting billions of hours writing posts that in most likelihood they don't know aren't getting through or why. That is extremely disrespectful.** Probably the retards behind this despicable medium think the lack of notification that posts aren't appearing and why is justified to "keep one step ahead of trolls and spammers", ignoring the billions of wasted hours of innocent users... </div>

    <div class="md">UPDATE! For fucks sake, I finally got the post through:     
https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7u6rtz/til_cocacola_was_accused_of_hiring_hitmen_from_a/dtqdt9x/?context=3  

Apparently the issue was the Google search links. Why the hell would a bot, automod or the spam filter not allow Google search links? I didn't think of that. But I wasted many hours of my life trying to pass the stupid invisible fitlers, complaining about the invisible filters. 

**WHY DOES THIS SHITHOLE MEDIUM HATE TRANSPARENCY!!!!***

Also I tried recently to post this to /r/feminism, but it also got filtered out:   

&gt;https://www.ceddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/7uxhr8/jay_z_a_poor_excuse_for_a_husband/     

&gt;

&gt;Ugh gross, another nerdy redditor posting about Game of Thrones the book series, pokemon go, and other immature, distracting dreck acting like they are the life of parties, in the real world.

&gt;In any case, neither you or the other ninny added anything to the conversation/debate for good reason: you are not capable of it.

&gt;People like Beyonce don' t wake up and personally decide to act like what 40 years ago would be considered by all the behavior of a slut or a whore. They are forced to either comply with selling themselves sexually as an object or facing the likely prospect of losing their slot(or should I write slut?) as an international pop-star. There are so many wanna-bes and young up and comers and people like Beyonce must know that alot of people are hungry to displace her. The second she refuses to play the game, she will be replaced and the next sexy body that has a passable singing voice will take her place as one of the most over-promoted female pop/hip hop cross-over stars.

Again I wasted alot of time, but I thought to myself what would they auto-censor like twats there. Then it hit me and I changed it to sluut and wh0re and the post went through finally after many failed attempts:
