    <div class="md">I haven't been following the situation too closely, but from what I know a number of women have come out accusing him of sexual misconduct (mostly on social media). One specific case was of author Zinzi Clemmons who confronted him at Sydney Writers’ Festival on May 4 about how he mistreated her in graduate school. Later that same day, she tweeted that he cornered and kissed her against her will 6 years ago. This was what sparked the other accusations.  </div>

    <div class="md">Dude, relax. In todays politcal climate (MeToo), I pointed out that someone can make accusations about another person and have seen these public individuals come under fire for it and have their lives fall apart. If this was done six years ago, it would not have the same effect as today, which is why I pointed out to "why now"

&gt; Y'all need to understand that if he was innocent then he'd likely have fought to keep whatever position he was in.

He hasn't even had enough time to get a lawyer to go through due process to confirm his guilt and people are already saying that he did it. 

&gt; Trump does it and he's not even innocent.
