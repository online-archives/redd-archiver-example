https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/r5l961/z/hmo63lp 

&gt;This is exactly how Reddit is moderated, except instead of race it's over political bias and wrongthink. The rules will apply to those who the mods disagree with politically, but often don't apply to those who they agree with. Some will let people continue posting unabated while they violate the rules, but censor/ban those they disagree with, who post opposing viewpoints, even when they did not violate the rules, they will twist a rule to defend their censorship of they won't reply and maybe the user actually did violate the rule, but you can be sure they will be punished harshly, while others who mods agree with, are free to violate the rules without being censored or banned. Some serious double standards and pro-censorship authoritarian/tyrannical mods on this site (which admins are probably delighted with) and I don't know how you can be authoritarian and pro-censorship and call yourself a leftist. 

I noticed my comment was removed when I logged out and it said [Removed]. I messaged the mods: 

&gt;I am contacting you to find out why my comment here was removed https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/r5l961/z/hmo63lp is removing my comment not proving my point (?) while allowing a reply to said comment to stay up despite it containing a personal attack? 

&gt;Hello again, the comment that was removed... 

&gt;Doesn't violate rule 7 and it doesn't appear to violate rule 8 either as there are no attacks in my comment directed towards any political party or side. Just looking for some clarification why my post was removed without explanation. 

I checked my inbox and saw this: 

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/facepalm. You can still view and subscribe to r/facepalm, but you won't be able to post or comment. 

&gt;Note from the moderators: 

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/r5l961/-/hmo63lp 

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/facepalm by replying to this message. 

So they banned me directly after removing my comment, and I was not aware when I sent the previous messages. 

I responded with: 

&gt;Just now seeing this after writing to you twice after noticing my comment was removed. What the hell? How the hell does my comment warrant a permanent ban (?) let alone being removed?? 

Then: 

&gt;The ban on politics here was to last 2 weeks. It has been 2 weeks according to the stickied megathread. 

And I have not heard back as of writing this.

The mod of the sticked post wrote replied to someone suggesting they keep the ban on politics up forever:

&gt;The response has been extremely poor, political posts always did well compared to non political posts, this sub's traffic did a nose dive in these 2 weeks

Yet they still do this even after the 2 weeks are up and do not answer to inquiries over bans.

Update:

A mod replied 6 hours later:

&gt;&gt;Rules 7 and 8 are not about comments, so you're correct.

&gt;Here's the section that relates to comments:

&gt;Bigotry is not tolerated, though facepalming at it is welcome.

&gt;Do not ask for personal info, harass or stalk others, troll, or engage trolls. Do not engage in witch hunts.

&gt;Moderators have full discretion in making decisions they deem to be in the best interest of the subreddit.

&gt;We require users to participate in good faith and make constructive arguments. No trolling. No disingenious comments designed to make a healthy conversation impossible.

I replied with:

&gt;So what of that did I break? I was not trolling or being disingenuous, my comment was in good faith. Neither was I 'witch-hunting.' How do you justify the removal and perma ban?

Currently waiting on a reply.

Mods replied 2 hours later with:

&gt;Pretending bigotry and racism are "just opinions that shouldnt be censored" for one.

I wrote back:

&gt;Where did I say that? My comment has zero to do with race and bigotry, I specifically talked about censorship of opposing political opinions.

Somehow mods think I support bigotry and racism because I am against censorship?

The mod replied with linking me this comment of mine below:

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/r5l961/black_kid_denied_entry_to_restaurant_because_of/hmo7em6/

Which they did not remove and still have not removed despite using it to defend the decision to censor and ban me.

And then:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/facepalm. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/facepalm for 3 days.</div>
