Are y'all saying this because there's an overlap with white supremacist groups and law enforcement be it federal, state, or local?

    <div class="md">No it's more along the lines of that these groups randomly show up, dressed exactly the same, hide their faces, and vanish into thin air. We live in a world of social media where hiding ones identity is damn near impossible.

Let's take antifa members for example. When they should up and so something they are usually identified shortly their after. Never do we see these group members identified. Plus I forget which group it was but it was the blue shirt ones with the khakis that were even in cuffs the one time. No arrests, no mug shots, and even while they were all handcuffed police allowed them to remain masked.

I am just saying there is enough evidence to show that these people aren't what they appear to be.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean people have been put away for life with less evidence then I just submitted here. I am sure there is a more broken down argument for this somewhere. 

But let me just ask you this. For what good reason are these people marching for? The overwhelming majority of Americans don't agree with nazis, like 99.9999999% if we are being honest. So why would anyone get together with other in matching outfits and march like this.


Plus again as I stated how have none of them been revealed. This is 2024, with technology and social media everyone and anyone can be revealed in less than a day. Even antifa who wears masks are revealed pretty easily. Why not here?</div>

I mean maybe a black person in some racist shithole, but in general, nah not really.

>But let me just ask you this. For what good reason are these people marching for?

Fuck if I know, maybe it's intended to intimidate, maybe it's meant to provoke a reaction, maybe it's private citizens intending to further divide. It's also possible that these are people in authority who genuinely hold those ideas and that's why they're not being revealed.</div>

    <div class="md">>No it's more along the lines of that these groups randomly show up, dressed exactly the same, hide their faces, and vanish into thin air

They openly have physical fitness and uniform standards - as described on their website, so as to present a better representation of the "Aryan race", ala what you'd see in Nazi propaganda. Considering that the original nazis had physical fitness standards, similar attire, and haircuts, that must've been the FBI marching down the streets of Weimar.

The masks are because:

>[Far-right Patriot Front members sue](https://archive.ph/N6Sr4) leftist activist for allegedly leaking their identities: As a result of the “doxing” — the spilling of private information on the internet — the five plaintiffs say they were fired from their jobs, have been threatened at their homes, and had their tires slashed, among other consequences, the lawsuit says.



---

>Never do we see these group members identified. Plus I forget which group it was but it was the blue shirt ones with the khakis that were even in cuffs the one time. No arrests, no mug shots, and even while they were all handcuffed police allowed them to remain masked.

Man, you really must exclusively get your "news" from whatever's curated for you on twitter. Because they [were unmasked on-site](https://youtu.be/dI6emv2lBAA), and ultimately [named, mugshotted, and prosecuted](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/names-released-idaho-patriot-front-pride-men-b2099837.html).

Also, if they were "feds", why detain them in the first place but not unmask them - according to you?

I guess the notoriously conservative, $11 billion budget FBI is simultaneously competent enough to pull off dozens of false flags without any leaks/whistleblowers, all to make conservatives look bad by proxy or some shit, yet dumb enough to apparently repeatedly expose their ops in plain sight. Because the enemy is both strong and weak as necessary.

>When they should up and so something they are usually identified shortly their after.

Proof?

Also, these groups have had their [websites hacked and members](https://unicornriot.ninja/a-guide-to-patriot-fronts-leaked-media-files/) revealed, but I guess if Jack '1488' Posobiec never tells you it happened, it didn't happen.</div>

Who is that? 

No one thinks the same exact thing on all subject all at once, except if you do it from tribalism.

That *y'all* is only in your mind, completely fabricated and is very akin to "the other" the Nazi used to dehumanize their victims.</div>
