Oh dear... looks like the mods are cracking down on wrongthink. They locked the thread and purged the comments.

[And... the poster got banned. The cherry on top.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/98vx9h/it_only_took_9_comments_for_this_post_to_get/e4jwgaj/?context=3)

Maybe /r/worldnews will be more open and uncensored?

[This thread removed for supposedly having a editoralised title... sure yeah. Thats just one post though, the title wasnt entire accurate, maybe they were just enforcing the rul-](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/98viqa/south_african_govt_approves_first_farm_seizures/)

[This thread removed for having a misleading title. Huh. Can't find fault with the post? I guess just use the catchall rule!](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/98tqki/south_africa_begins_seizing_whiteowned_farms/)

With the censoring of /r/uncensorednews by the admins, once again the need for an uncensored alternative to the default news subs becomes apparent. 

**If you're interested in growing this alternative, stop by /r/realworldnews.**</div>

    <div class="md">There's no reasoning with these people because you're working on a flawed premise. They're just anti-white, with their own in-group preference, they use the nonsense idea of "racism" to prevent whites from having any group identity, which fractures ethnic Europeans into a million little "individialist" pieces while only further strengthening and solidifying their own ethnic identity. 

The west was built and ran by whites, the more "diverse" it becomes the worse it gets (I know I know, just a mere coincidence).</div>

    <div class="md">Yep, I'm being banned from a new sub every few days and most of the time it's after being heavily up voted. It's outrageous either way, but when your censoring/banning ideas that the community is actively agreeing with it sends a pretty strong message that you don't have logic, reason or factual evidence on your side. I'm glad to have a discussion and my views are certainly subject to being changed with new information, but it's always the same insults followed by being reported and the  banned. What's the point of even discussing things of you're only willing to discuss them with others that 100% agree? </div>

Someone asked "Why did a racist comment not get her fired? I thought everyone was getting fired because of racist comments these days."

Hate everything they actually do there lol.

Don't mind the articles the rest of reddit censors... 

It's sad we've reached critical tricking mass where the admits actually have successfully bleached the record of their mass censorship to the point where normal reddit users don't actually know the history of this website.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't see how news themselves can be echo chambers, so I'm assuming you are referring to the comment sections and userbase of the sub.
It is one of the greatest faults of social media that it inevitably leads to echo chambers because of human nature. So the goal we have with the sub is to have  a place to share news that are otherwise suppressed. 
I think it's every man's duty to properly inform himself in the information he reads and not only listen to one or a handful of likelyminded sources. </div>

    <div class="md">Guys, lets have a bit of a reality check here.

As sad as it is, we all know what /r/news &amp; /r/politics are about. 

I see so many "I got censored" posts here from these 2 subs and as much of a shame that it is, we all know what's going to happen to you if you decide to go against the grain. 

Reddit for the \*most part\* is very much left leaning. It always will be. 

There are no mods to mod the mods.. Reddit Admin are all about the $$'s and won't work towards making a sub neutral when it caters to the majority audience of the site. It keeps advertisers happy and that's what counts. 

I know you all know this and that it's not news to you, but sometimes we need to step back and understand the thought behind the actions. 

I give our Sub another 2-4 months before we get tagged for 'Hate Speech' and will be shut down. 

I hope Ramblin Rambo is around somewhere to see that this sub is still kicking for now. 

Carry on. </div>

    <div class="md">Do the lefty kids running the subs think that by hiding and/or inhibiting these threads that they are helping their offbase agenda? 
Seems counter-intuitive to the adult base who reads reddit. Sure, that's not a lot of the demographic on the news and worldnews subs, but the few adults who read those subs are going to question the motives and wonder what is being hidden and why. That doesnt help your cause. But good, let the idiots here keep hampering their narrative. </div>

    <div class="md">Reddit has plenty of spaces where you can go off on racist rants or make infantile little racist quips.  The threads on worldnews are filled with you guys making your supremacist statements.  Anyone reading the headline who knows anything about reddit knows any thread on the subject will be filled with it.  Rational people can understand how the news mods wouldn't feel like dealing with it on a Monday.  There's censorship, and then there's just being tired of your shit.
