      <div class="md">I was permanently banned from r/Anthropology for explaining a bit of the context around the ~8,500 year old remains of the Kennewick Man and NAGPRA, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, to someone who asked. It wasn't against the rules, but there was a mod comment threatening that "Blanket statements about how repatriation is anti-science will be removed, and possibly get you banned."


I argued that it was presumptuous to assume what burial traditions would have been preferred by people who died almost ten thousand years ago. That's about it. I don't see how that is a blanket statement about repatriation being anti-science. Also, my comment is still up, so the mod didn't even follow through on removing it, just me. I sent a message asking for reconsideration but was ignored. 


I love anthropology. I have published in anthropology, and have anthropologist colleagues. I *despise* the anthropology subreddit and what it has become.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, mods are openly abusing their tiny bit of power to push their bullshit beliefs. I got temp banned from /r/soccer/ for telling people that, no, koreans aren't terrified of fans and no, they don't believe that you'll die from them.

But apparently koreans aren't allowed to talk about what koreans believe in LOL.</div>

    <div class="md">Every sub is going to be like this before you know it.  I post on the Dallas subreddit and the mods there are about 50 feet underwater in the liberal side of the pool like they are everywhere.  Apparently one of them is a pitbull apologist so when a story was posted about a lady getting attacked by a pitbull he was going through deleting comments about pitbulls.  Bunch of comments got posted about the mods etc etc… I was like, first time? How does that feel, fuckers?

Reddit will be useless on any topic within a couple of years as all dissent is squashed.</div>

    <div class="md">There needs to be some way for communities to hold mods accountable. I have no faith in Reddit to fix it but if someone were to create another site similar I would jump to it. Even the best intentioned mods can so easily become dictators with power that cannot be questioned. Allowing random people to have absolute power towards others just isn’t a good system. Especially when so much of everything is politicized and polarized. One wrong word and lifetime ban. I used to pay Reddit so I could skip all the ads, but fuck this site, never getting a dime from me again.</div>
