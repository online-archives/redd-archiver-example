    <div class="md">It's scary when these huge tech companies are being frightened by something so seemingly benign as free speech. Everyone on Reddit rises up about net neutrality and how if we don't push for it then companies will use their power to control who gets to have what content in Fast lanes. But when Gab.com gets censored and *every* "news" story for some reason calls it a "far-right social network" these same people trip over themselves to applaud the move first. It's ok to censor free speech when it's speech you disagree with.

I wish there were a similar site where you could say whatever you want and it was mostly the left on there saying their piece. But free speech spaces don't attract the left, because they can say their piece right out in the open on almost alllll the popular subs and they get applauded and upvoted. Who needs a free speech site when you can speak your opinion anywhere already? </div>

    <div class="md">In case the site is simply 404'd by the time you reach it, here is the statement that you get when navigating to their page:

&gt;Gab has spent the past 48 hours proudly working with the DOJ and FBI to bring justice to an alleged terrorist. Because of the data we provided, they now have plenty of evidence for their case. In the midst of this Gab has been no-platformed by essential internet infrastructure providers at every level. We are the most censored, smeared, and no-platformed startup in history, which means we are a threat to the media and to the Silicon Valley Oligarchy. 

&gt;Gab isn’t going anywhere. 

&gt;It doesn’t matter what you write. It doesn’t matter what the sophist talking heads say on TV. It doesn’t matter what verified nobodies say on Twitter. We have plenty of options, resources, and support. We will exercise every possible avenue to keep Gab online and defend free speech and individual liberty for all people. 

&gt;You have all just made Gab a nationally recognized brand as the home of free speech online at a time when Silicon Valley is stifling political speech they disagree with to interfere in a US election. 

&gt;The internet is not reality. TV is not reality. 80% of normal everyday people agree with Gab and support free expression and liberty. The online outrage mob and mainstream media spin machine are the minority opinion. People are waking up, so please keep pointing the finger at a social network instead of pointing the finger at the alleged shooter who holds sole responsibility for his actions. 

&gt;No-platform us all you want. Ban us all you want. Smear us all you want. 

&gt;You can’t stop an idea. 

&gt;As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online. Thank you and remember to speak freely. 

&gt;Andrew Torba, CEO Gab.com</div>

Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word".

    <div class="md">I know that the subreddit is intended to be for WikiHow parodies.

But, if I were to see someone posting about a vacation to Disney there, I would ask why they were posing there.

Or, if I were to see people posting something about a particular shitty show on the Fox network to r/foxandfriends instead of pictures of foxes (and friends), I would call it out.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm truly sorry that you are not seeing the content you feel is appropriate for the subreddit. If the majority of subscribers don't believe this is the content they want to see either, then we'll look in to it. But I feel that the content is appropriate for the subreddit since most people are coming here to observe the ongoing censorship of the internet in general, not just what's happening on Reddit. I feel like another subreddit solely about non-reddit censorship would be pretty redundant.

I find myself having the same reaction you're having to content on other subs such as /r/WorldNews allowing US news/politics/opinion/analysis as long as it's shitting on Trump. But that sub has specific rules against that sort of post, so my complaints are based solely on their hypocrisy in allowing their rules to be broken to further a narrative.

If we had a strict "only censorship from Reddit" rule then I'd definitely agree with you.

I want you to know that I'm happy you're letting us know that you don't feel this sort of content is appropriate. Like I said, I find myself in your position a lot and every single time the mods make it super clear that they're pushing a narrative, they don't give a shit about their rules, and they definitely don't give a shit about me.

Please know that I definitely do not feel that way about you and about your opinion. :-) </div>

    <div class="md">Says the guy calling people retards. If you didn't have double standards you'd have no standards at all. The goddammed hypocrisy your side is fucking embarrassing.

Let me see if I've got your side figured out:

"Let's show them they are hateful by being hateful" but doesn't that just mean you're hateful too?

"Let's show them they are racist by hating whitey" but doesn't that just make you a racist, because I don't have anymore control over the color of my skin than a black man does?

"Let's show them they are sexist by hating men" but doesn't that just make you a sexist?

Honestly your side is so hateful, so racist, and so sexist I'd be embarrassed if I were you. Luckily America is seeing through it finally, they see the hate on the left, the hypocrisy on the left, the extremist violence on the left, and sadly nobody has the brains to clean the left up.

Mostly though, I'm glad you guys keep posting dumb shit like this, normies see it for what it is, and they don't like it at all. </div>

    <div class="md">Oh I wouldn't for one second try and insinuate that GoDaddy did something outside their rights. No one is saying that. But you're in an entire subreddit devoted to spreading the anti-censorship sentiment and ensuring the world sees how the big players are using censorship to shape what people see. That's what GoDaddy is doing here.

I'd rather make my own decision as to what I want to see and what I don't want to see. That doesn't make me a "hateful retard."</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;It’s not censorship to not let someone use your platform for ignorance and hatred. You don’t have a right to use things that belong to others especially for stupid shit 

Here's the definition of censorship:

&gt;the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.

It doesn't matter if you or anyone else feel its "ignorance and hatred." That's what's so great about censorship, it isn't about opinion. This entire subreddit simply observes and documents the censorship. Whether we agree or disagree with what's being censored is irrelevant. </div>
