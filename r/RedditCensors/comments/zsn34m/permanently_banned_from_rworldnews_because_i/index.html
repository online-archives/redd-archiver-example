    <div class="md">Yea...I don't even dare to try to talk about all the anti-black hate going on in Ukraine, still.   


I get it. They want to pretend there aren't still problems in Ukraine so they can drum up support for their war. I just want people who say they support gay rights to actually do it and not just when politically convenient. Two different paths in life, I suppose</div>

    <div class="md">Nafo and dfou types are all up in threads on the front and subs that frequent the front of reddit. Same with shareblue/MM4A/CAP types. Same with govt trolls. In between the propaganda, gaslighting and disinformation and the downvote brigade, (see boosting/forum sliding and gentlemen's guide to forum spies and astroturf megathread over at r shills sub) they are abusing the report function to get you censored and banned. They even gloat about getting tweets pulled and youtubers demonitized.

The same folks who cheered when people got censored over covering the hunter Biden story (which was wrongly labeled as right wing and Russian disinfo to interfere in an election and the supression of this story was itself election interference and with help of FBI in coordination with big tech in favor of Biden - which is basically that fascism dems fearmonger about for votes), are now outraged when they are censored for doxxing. You see the blatant hypocrisy of liberals. Notice I didn't say leftists because there's many leftists who are anti establishment anti war anti censorship, who were censored the last few years, ramping up since 2016 and even moreso before the 2020 election. 

Anyways, I believe a number of subs may be compromised at mod level by smear agents/political operatives w.e (CTR/shareblue has been caught doing this) but many mods just give in to bogus reports for free whether it's that they are lazy or more likely it suits their political bias which is molded by the aforementioned social media manipulation campaign out the govt/MIC/big pharma/political think tanks. And let's not forget it isn't just mods or power mods specifically but I'm pretty sure the director of policy used to work for Atlantic Council who has ties to NATO and CIA, so there's also that.

We know the Hillary-DNC-MSM collusion, which also included FBI and big tech collusion and we know the govt leanes on and works with big tech and over at Facebook and Twitter (who censor at the behest of them and Biden's people and now the WH) and they seemed all to happy to help censor, if anyone thinks the same thing isn't happening here on Reddit just as bad if not worse, I have a bridge to sell them!</div>

There's no point in posting anything unless you're in niche subreddits.

Debating any point on anything just gets you banned.

    <div class="md">Funny thing...I wasn't even subscribed to their subreddit, just kept getting promoted by reddit and occasionally I'd see something and just comment on it with my opinion. Never anything hateful and never EEEVER personal attacks against people. But my leftist opinion gets me banned from anywhere libs can so it didn't surprise me, but it's the very first time I've been banned from somewhere on reddit so I wanted to mock them for their sillyness</div>

    <div class="md">Any time there is a bigger than usual news event (for example, Russia/Ukraine, Twitter, etc.), I've noticed that a lot of the top posters are 10-year old accounts with just a handful of posts.

Case in point: [https://imgur.com/a/CbjYo4S](https://imgur.com/a/CbjYo4S) (10-year old account which has 4 days of posts).

Wouldn't be surprised if they are actually abandoned accounts which have been bought.  Simply searching for how to do that in google gives you thousands of results - so it isn't impossible. Then we have the whole thing where the most Reddit-"addicted" city is Eglin Air Force Base...</div>
