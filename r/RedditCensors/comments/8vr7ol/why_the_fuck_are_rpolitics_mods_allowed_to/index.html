There's mountains of evidence that this happens every hour of every day, but my question is -- how does reddit allow random 20-somethings to insert themselves into political conversations on one of today's most important platforms for speech? 

I know I'm preaching to the choir, but this is really very serious. /r/politics is a liberal circlejerk not because conservatives don't go there, but because liberal fuckwit mods quietly delete those comments. And most people have no idea. At the very least, reddit admins need to insist that mods follow SOME KIND OF FUCKING GUIDELINES, show cause for deleting comments, and *notify the comment's author that it has been deleted and why*. 

As it is, they do whatever the fuck they want, and the ramifications are, as you all know, quite significant. Fuck everything about reddit. It's a corrupt, liberal fucking cesspool. </div>

What other countries display the statues and flags of the losers?

 We'll never forget that the south got its ass kicked. 


We'll never forget how inept the southern generals were in the end. 


We'll never forget the traitors were quelled and were made to take up plows again.

 As the winners of the Civil War we dictate the terms and your dumb ass statues of traitors and all other tributes to traitors are forfeit, get the fuck over it "THE SOUTH LOST"

These snowflakes want to remember the glorious failures of the South.

    <div class="md">the admins have used their darling SRS powermod cabal to do their dirtywork for YEARS.

Only recently, after to Pou debacle, did they start sticking their hands in the shit themselves. Straight up quarantining and banning subs they do not find financially or politically acceptable.

All the while, cesspools of ShareBlue propaganda like /politics are given free reign.  They constitently burn smaller subs by brigading a thread to the front page, to get around the admin's site-wide filters.

The admins are fully aware and complaicent.  As well as allowing sooo many corporate shills. Blatant advertising galore.

And of course, there is the enormous rabid  rad-fem  faction. This cancer is seen on the vast majority of large subs, especially the defaults. 

All of the above has been going on for a LONG time.  /politics in specific completely changed when Correct the Record (now Shareblue) got a 6 million dollar budget boost.

Politics went from a relatively neutral / Bernie / Hillary debate,  

and litterally overnight, turned into the rabid anti-Trump cesspool of propaganda it is today.   /news /worldnews.. so many others are basically owned and operated by Shareblue. 

With full admin cooperation. :(</div>

    <div class="md">I think you're completely correct. Question is, what can we do about it? At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this really feels like ideological *war*. 

Exposure, I think, is key. I think if we made more 1st Amendment advocates aware of what goes on in this cesspool, it might put some pressure on reddit to at least address the issue. Leftists are into public shaming, so let's follow suit.

I'd love to see Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson take this on with the urgency it calls for. Hell, even Bill Maher would find this odious and indefensible. 

Despite this crazy surge in toxic Leftists who want to abolish free speech, the vast majority of Americans regard it as sacrosanct. And by the same token, the vast majority of conservatives are unaware that a major ideological battle is being lost due to Leftist shenanigans.

    <div class="md">I think reddit's entire track record of censorship is absolutely shameful, but I think the suppression of political speech is particularly egregious, and should set off alarm bells for everyone. 

Back in the days when radio was a major political influencer, a law was passed to guarantee "equal air time" to both democrats and republicans. It made sense, so as to prevent either side from gaining an unfair advantage through simple saturation of the airwaves.

But that's EXACTLY what we have going on here. And not because of happenstance, but because of the *intentional machinations* of random "college kid mods." 

Just as reddit has special rules for subs once they hit /r/all, America needs to realize that reddit is a major platform for social discourse in this nation, and to allow partisan Leftist college kids to **sneakily** influence that, is not something that can be defended by pointing out that Reddit is a private company. This is having a chilling effect on discourse, and ratcheting up the hostility on all sides.

But like all liberals, I'm sure reddit's management thinks, "but it's okay when we do it."</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit treats subredditd as the property of the person who created it; the head mod and mods are given control over the content on their sub.  While I don't like the fact that politics is biased, manipulative, and openly dishonest, I don't think it is violating any rules. With that said, I see absolutely no reason why politics should be a default sub. Given the extensive history of censorship and brigading and some legitimate evidence that the sub moderation was sold to a Democratic PAC, it should not be a default suv</div>

    <div class="md">Its their subreddit.They can do whatever they want with it. That's really all there is to it.

 Edit: I wrote everything below this after already posting.

 I mean, TD bans people for being critical of Trump, as does r/conservative. So they're just as guilty.

Of course, site-wide changes would be good. I don't personally like the system in place. But to pretend its just one subreddit doing it? That's simply not the case.</div>

    <div class="md">Every time I've had a comment deleted anywhere, I've been given some sort of an excuse why. This has only really ever happened on right leaning subs, such as when I posted a fat girl in hotties for Trump, or when I was critical of trump in the Donald.

Why does the age of the mods matter? They might very well be 20 something's. That age range probably makes up the majority of Reddit. Why not try to become a mod yourself if you think it isn't being ran right? Start your own political sub, one that you are mod of and free from political bias.</div>

    <div class="md">This is how all subreddits work. They are controlled entirely by the mod teams discretion of that subreddit. Some subreddits enact strict policies abide by them, others enact vague policies and do whatever they want.

"don't be a jerk" is a common rule on many subreddits these days which is basically a catch-all for speech the mods don't like. Usually dissenting opinions qualify as being a jerk in the eyes of the mods.

    <div class="md">What you have to understand is that /r/politics is not 'the politics section of Reddit' but rather one of many thousands of independent communities, each with its own rules and mods and mod guidelines.   

So while 'politics' is certainly an official-sounding title for a sub, in reality there are no 'official' subs (save for things like /r/announcements).  /r/politics is just one of many.  

Therefore, the mods of /r/politics are welcome to run *their sub* in any way they see fit.  That includes deleting comments they disagree with if they want to.  The appropriate response (annoying as it is) is to unsubscribe and move to another sub.  </div>

    <div class="md">You misunderstand me.  

I don't like biased moderation any more than you do.  However I look at the alternative- how do we fix this?  If moderators are *required* to be neutral, who enforces that neutrality?  Do Reddit admins start stealing subreddits from overly biased mod teams?  Who determines what is 'biased' and what isn't?  Should any subreddit with a mainstream popular name (ie 'Politics') be held to a different standard than other subreddits?  etc etc etc.  

For the record- I'm mostly liberal and I can't fucking stand the constant mindless anti-Trump circle jerk.  I'm all for intelligent criticism but what we have now is TRUMP BAD HATE TRUMP GOOD SUPPORT TRUMP BAD so if you say something even slightly good about Trump you get downvoted to oblivion in short order.  It's pathetic.  We (liberals) are supposed to be more intelligent than this.  

However while I'd love to fix that, and I'd love for /r/politics to be a neutral place, I don't see any way of making that happen without seriously changing what Reddit is.  If admins start stealing subreddits, that's a VERY slippery slope.  And who gets those subreddits?  How long before /r/news /r/technology /r/politics and every other 'major category name' have been taken over to present an Admin-curated view of things?  

No, that is a Bad Thing.  I don't like censorship in subreddits, but I also value the independent authority of subreddit moderators.  The side-effect of that is we will have some badly moderated subreddits.  That's the cost of doing business, and I'm okay with it.  

So in short- I'm saying 'leave if you don't like it' because the same thing applies to all other subreddits (including conservative subreddits).  I believe each subreddit owner should be able to run their sub as they see fit.  

I hope that clears up my position :)</div>

Simply make it so mods must cite specific rules that were broken before deleting any comment. Currently, it's arbitrary, and mods delete opinions they don't like. That's the problem. 

If the shoe were on the other foot, liberals would be shrieking at the top of their lungs.</div>

    <div class="md">Rule #1:  Posts and comments we feel do not add to the discussion or which discriminate against any person or group will be deleted.

Bam, your policy is now useless.  Why did you delete that?  I felt it didn't add to the discussion.  End of story.  Or Why did you delete that well thought out post advocating for border security?  Because it advocates for action that overwhelmingly affects Mexicans and is thus discrimination.  End of story.  

But for the sake of argument let's say we do what you suggest.  How do we stop overly broad rules like the above?  And if someone wants to complain about the moderatorship, who do they complain to?  What is done about it?  Do we set up a situation where Reddit admins regularly remove mod positions and install different mods?  I don't think that's better.
