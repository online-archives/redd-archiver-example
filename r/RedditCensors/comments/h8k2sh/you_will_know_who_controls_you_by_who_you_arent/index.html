    <div class="md">"Anti-Evil Operations team." Could have thought up a better team name.  wasn't it a big thing back in the 20s to be anti communist in America? it does sound like you were trying to start a movement? An interesting topic, the individual rights a person has to do just that, much like their team name, you should consider starting a more peaceful movement, the world really does need less vitriol, they may let you if you are a bit more tactful and mindful of what is highlighted, you have good intentions I feel, maybe try to parse your emotions on the matter and take them into further consideration, develop your idea and intentions more. my best.</div>

    <div class="md">Not my banner a repost. And with the way daily death threats on certain other subreddits are ignored doesn't this seem a bit selective in how its enforced.

Near daily r/chapotraphouse and subreddit very similar have death threats and shit exactly like this. It gets reported. Reports are ignored. But even joke about killing a communist or socialist by tossing them from helicopters, like your average reddit user has free access to helicopters and knows how to fly them, and that gets threats of physical removal.

Communist trash is catered to on this web site at the very least and being ran by them at worst.

This illustrates the idea very well and if even one person's eyes are opened by this disgusting double standard good.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not saying they are not biased, but you have to remember that they ARE commies.  Or at least that's the label they identify with.  So you're basically insulting Reddit admins directly.

And considering they are probably also what your username is making fun of... it's just a shitfest of anti-reddit hate coming from you.  You will get no leniency, and just because they selectively enforce their rules does not mean you did not break them.  :/</div>
