    <div class="md">Oh shit, you can't say that kind of stuff on that sub reddit. Those women are very fragile, and very angry.

Calling a woman Karen is like a racial epithet to them. It's one of the worst things you can say. That said, I truly do approve of your comment. It was worth it, and that's the attitude you should have. You lose nothing by not being able to post among those lost souls.</div>

    <div class="md">I still believe TwoX is secretly run by incels who honestly hate women. It has the absolute worst advice for women that I have ever seen. It's all about how you have been a victim, how you're currently a victim, and how you will be a victim. 

Remember, that sub lauded a girl who said she ran her first 10k (I think it was a 10k?) and then her story fell apart and was proven to be a liar. Then the hens there decided to praise her for lying and she should be motivated. 

They are one of the top 5 awful subs on this site, and they have no desire to see their internal problems and address them.</div>

    <div class="md">I was permanently banned from there a few years ago... and I've never posted there. I think it was because I commented on an r/thedonald post that made it to the front page... even though I was criticizing blind Trump support with my comment, lmao. The mods refused to explain why I was banned and only said it was a late ban due to an old infraction, then stopped responding when I said I'd never posted on the sub before.</div>
