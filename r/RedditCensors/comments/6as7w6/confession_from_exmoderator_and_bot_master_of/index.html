This post will hopefully clear everything up, I'm not going to be hiding anything, and will be telling the full truth. 

*I've also removed myself from the mod team. There's too much shady shit going on, especially with ban evasion. Like really, if you're going to evade a Reddit ban, don't pick the same name but with an underscore after it...*

**You were right, u/ggggnut, some good detective work.**

So here's the full story; I don't remember exactly when, but a couple of months ago I became a mod of MAT and /r/redonkulous. At this point, MAT was at around 10k subs and u/SnusTheMus was the head mod. For about a week I posted 5 articles a day, which I was told was the requirement for a moderator. I eventually suggested to Snus that I create a bot that reposts from certain subreddits to redonkulous to keep the flow of posts up, which he thought was a good idea and so I implemented it. The whole point of redonkulous was that things could be reposts, and so I thought there would be no harm in doing this.     

Snus then requested I do one for MAT, and so with no questions asked I did. I can't tell you why, I think I just wanted to suck up to him for full perms of an ever growing subreddit, which I ended up getting. The bots I made broke no rules of Reddit, and just used a few simple IFTTT recipes. For a while, my main account was automatically posting to MAT and redonkulous, but as it cluttered up my profile page, I made u/cereal-reposta and spread the posts across these two accounts. As time went on, more accounts were made for posting, eventually reaching 5. /u/theiastjedi u/cereal-reposta /u/thisisnatyocheese and u/micro_west.

A couple of days ago I deleted the IFTTT recipies, sent a message to the head mod saying I was resigning as I didn't agree with what was happening, and started to delete posts from the accounts. Clearly I lack willpower, as he managed to convince me to come back as a mod, and remake the bots. I agreed on a few conditions. One, that he would tell me in complete honesty if there was any vote manipulation going on, two, that he was fully honest with people about the accounts , and three, that I could clear it with the admins to double check that it wasn't against any rules. I re-activated two of the accounts, and messaged the admins. I still haven't got a response from them, and doubt that I will get one.

That's the full story, I have now deleted the IFTTT recipes and left as a moderator of the subreddit. Leave any questions you have below and I will answer honestly. 

TLDR/FAQ

*Does MAT use bots for posting content?*

Yes.

*Does MAT use bots for upvotes?*

To the best of my knowledge, no. I explicitly asked the current head mod of the sub to tell the if there was any sort of vote manipulation going on, and he told me there wasn't, which I believe.

*Did u/Wondermonkeydans setup the bots?*

Yes. 

*Was u/Wondermonkeydans paid to setup the bots?*

No.

Kek, how many MAT mods have been suspended so far? in the /r/esist disavowal thread, someone counted 9:

*Example 1: /u/hazardnipt - [This WaybackMachine snapshot from January 28](https://web.archive.org/web/20170128231952/https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/) lists them as creator and moderator of MAT but they are currently suspended.  The other moderator in that snapshot /u/DemocratsForJustice has deleted their account.

*Example 2: /u/HandSanitizerForHate - [This snapshot from January 30](https://web.archive.org/web/20170130005001/https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 3: /u/karmanautrino - [This snapshot from March 8](https://web.archive.org/web/20170308130938/https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 4: /u/Ajmaee - [This snapshot from March 8](https://web.archive.org/web/20170308130938/https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 5: /u/SnusTheMus - [This snapshot from March 17](https://web.archive.org/web/20170317002054/https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 6: /u/bluerad0n - [This snapshot from April 7](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407170157/https://www.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/about/moderators) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 7: /u/DeadbeatCara - [This snapshot from March 25](https://archive.is/lhIlY#selection-2553.0-2553.12) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 8: /u/ItalianPrince - [This snapshot from March 25](https://archive.is/lhIlY#selection-2553.0-2553.12) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

*Example 9: /u/Hallkirchwt - [This snapshot from February 22](https://archive.fo/ecwlW) lists them as a moderator, but they are currently suspended.

&gt; Last time I checked the only person that was suspended by admins was one of your counterparts.

Yeah? which co-mod of mine is suspended again?</div>

Just because you haven't been caught yet, doesn't mean you haven't committed a crime.

Fake internet points, and the fact that I'd be an essential part of a large subreddit, as the bots provided most of the content. Looking back, I realise how dumb that sounds.

&gt; The widespread consensus among redditors is that ShareBlue/CTR/external forces play a role in the upvoting of the anti Trump content. While you were a mod, did you come across any evidence for this kind of manipulation? 


I've seen all the conspiracy theories, and have always actively looked for things that might lead to them being true, but I didn't ever see anything that might suggest any involvement from external forces. And imho, the comments from moderators seemed too immature and unprofessional at times for anything like that </div>

This is the summary of why Reddit sucks so hard. Honestly why did you waste so much of your life for Reddit karma and astroturf? They have turned this shithole medium into the most massive MMORPG for mega-nerd, geeks, outcasts, pedophiles, immature political shills, racists. Most normal people post on Reddit and probably get sick of such games, leaving only the outcasts and agenda pushers to tilt at it. </div>

&gt; To the best of my knowledge, no. I explicitly asked the current head mod of the sub to tell the if there was any sort of vote manipulation going on, and he told me there wasn't, which I believe.

    <div class="md">&gt; Clearly **I lack willpower**, as he managed to convince me to come back as a mod, and **remake the bots**. **I agreed** on a few conditions. One, that he would tell me in complete honesty if there was any vote manipulation going on, two, that he was fully honest with people about the accounts , and three, that I could clear it with the admins to double check that it wasn't against any rules.

    <div class="md">&gt; Why should I believe your stated motivations considering you made it a point to spend hundreds of hours spamming lies and propaganda that "just happen" to conveniently perfectly line up with their shill talking points?

You have a good point, and I realise that I'm not in a position to ask you to believe me, so all I can say is this: I created these bots for internet points, internet points which mean literally nothing. It took me a couple of hours to setup, and the content posted by them had nothing to do with me, I didn't regulate it. Honestly, I hated most of the content that became popular, as it was mainly just 'upvote if you h8 Trump' type stuff, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. All I can do now is apologize </div>

    <div class="md">Nah capitalism all the way. Competition is key.

&gt;Well you answered your second day question with the first.
 
But what does this even mean? 

I would rather pay higher taxes to help out my fellow Americans and local community, rather than cut them off of any support altogether just to save myself a few bucks. That doesn't seem very Christian of us.

So then, why would a single post on reddit suddenly change anybodys political mindset??

It wont... because some people are in it for themselves, and some are in it for their community.

    <div class="md">On behalf of the subreddit, I thank u/Wondermonkeydans for coming forward with his evidence and helping making reddit a little bit better, and a little cleaner from manipulation.

Should any other user want to come forward with evidence of malfeasance, [our modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FRedditCensors) is always open (and, of course, they can always  post directly to our subreddit).</div>
