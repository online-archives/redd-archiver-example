    <div class="md">To make my point clear, I was saying that the "token black guy" term isn't a dig at the character itself - it's a dig at the writers, who wrote a shallow, stereotyped character in the name of being inclusive. Like, "we have to have a black character so we don't appear to be racist, so we'll provide the absolute minimal amount of work in developing the character, just as long as he appears on screen enough so we can appear to be inclusive". 

Calling a character a "generic white dude" is a dig at the character itself, as if there's something inherently wrong with being a white guy unless you have some sort of uber-defining characteristic. 

I don't think the two terms are used in the same way. That was my only point, but now I've been banned for racism, which is absolutely absurd to me given that I've spent years serving in various minority communities and have never let race be any form of unit of measurement when determining the quality of a person. 

Not being allowed to even discuss racial issues in any way is blatant censorship.</div>

    <div class="md">It's a shame this wasn't the reply you posted because it's a far better explanation.  Regardless, what you wrote - while sounding like a common complaint among actual racists - certainly didn't really qualify as "racism," which to me is judging (or treating unfairly/differently) someone based on race.  There was no judging of anyone here, although you didn't make your point very clearly and so it was very open to interpretation. You should've known that racism is one of several very sensitive topics and that you'd need to be very careful in how you approached the topic to avoid misinterpretations.

It's absurd how easily people get banned with no recourse but appealing to the very people who banned you in the first place, who too often are biased themselves and unlikely to be honest with themselves (let alone anybody else) and admit they might've made a mistake and been too quick to judge by initial appearance themselves. I've long complained Reddit needs a better process in place.</div>

If you are a person that values freedom of speech, open exchange of ideas/thoughts, etc., the way reddit works is unbelievably flawed.  

What inevitably happens is that - eventually - for any given subject, a particular sub ends up reaching critical mass, and becomes "the" sub for that subject.  Once that happens, it basically becomes extremely hard/outright impossible to get any sort of numbers for another sub that deals with the same subject.  

At this point, what *then* happens is that the most militant, vocal, activist minded people end up taking over that sub.  They downvote, and subsequently eliminate any dissenting voices, and - if they manage to get enough of theirs placed in the moderation team for that sub - outright ban anyone that doesn't toe the party line.  Once that happens, they have total control over who is allowed to discuss that subject, and what they are allowed to say.

With demographics being the way they are on reddit, it's the radical left that does this here, and the state of things clearly reflects that.  

Any sub that has any sort of reach, and regularly reaches the front-page, is absolutely *ruled* by these people.  They insert their politics into *all* of those subs, and they are actively using their control to attempt to shape the public narrative; they do *not* tolerate any dissent.

Thus, we get what this guy here (and many - *many* - others have experienced): if you don't think exactly like they do, *you will eventually not be allowed to speak at all.*  

What is more sinister - I think - is that people who wander in here from the rest of the internet see what is/isn't allowed to be said, and they too become conditioned to view those dissenting opinions as "wrong-think"...

To sum things up, for any subject that isn't a niche subject, this site is almost pure echo-chamber propaganda now.  All the large subs have been seized by the activist left; speak in any way that they don’t approve of - even if it’s something that the **vast** majority of society would find totally acceptable - you are simply banned.  You have no recourse - there is no one to appeal to.  They, and they alone have been given stupid amounts of unelected, unchecked power to decide what can be said, and who is allowed to say it.

Again - if you are the sort of person that values the free exchange of ideas, reddit is an absolute disaster.  If, however, you are a leftist activist, this place is amazing: you have near total control of one of the internet's main platforms for discourse, and *you* get to decide what is/isn't allowed to be said.</div>

    <div class="md">There is definitely a strong leftist bias by Reddit admins, but I have been kicked out of subs on both sides of the fence - few people inclined to become a moderator of an even semi-popular sub seem to be immune to the "absolute power corrupts absolutely" effect. This is why Reddit desperately needs some method of counter-balancing said power, but I'm sure that will never happen until something occurs that makes a large percentage of users go elsewhere.</div>

    <div class="md">I mostly agree with you.  Some moderators from the few subs controlled by people from the other side of the spectrum (there is one ahole mod from r/conservative who  comes  to  mind)  can  just  as  bad  with  the   bans.

That being said, with regards to nearly all of the main/large subs, leftist/sjw types are the ones creating this issue.  They ban for anything they don’t like, and will mute you so that you can’t even communicate with them.

It’s absolutely ridiculous that this is allowed for major subs on one of the internet’s largest places for discussion.  No one should be allowed that level of unchecked power to silence people for completely arbitrary reasons.</div>

    <div class="md">My dude, reddit admins support that kind of disgusting behavior because since it's their kind of disgusting behavior if you know what I mean. Reddit is a very toxic place and I recommend spending as less time as possible on it. It's very easy to make a new account so don't get attached to it. Trust me frend, power tripping subhumans are the norm for online communities</div>

    <div class="md">I just got banned for a comment I made clarifying something the OP said. He was saying that heterophobia was a real thing and made the comparison about blaming today’s Germans for what the Nazis did. I clarified that point to a user who started going off about a line he said and how it still happens. That got me banned. I didn’t even actually agree with OP, I just clarified a point he made. 

But that shit that mod told you is some straight up racist bullshit. That dudes a piece of shit</div>

    <div class="md">You were absolutely right and you were banned as a result. Reddit mods are nothing more than the lowest scum of society who ban others since it's the only form of 'power' those miserable cretins will ever wield(they hate anyone who doesn't think they way they want).

Reddit is not a place for discussion. It's an echo chamber to prop up what ever pathetic manlet mod/admins dogma they prescribe to</div>

    <div class="md">It truly is ridiculous how much power mods have. Permanent bans should not be within their control unless voted on unanimously by the rest of the mod staff. That may not FIX the problem, but I bet it would help curtail renegade mods just banning people as they wish.</div>
