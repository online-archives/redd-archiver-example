Granted, I am a bit of a troll -- I don't buy into Russiagate and think that the cult of personality around Robert Mueller is ridiculous and so I made fun of them. I would not complain if they banned me, its totally within the rights of the mods to do so given my conduct there, but this shadow ban is shady as hell.

Thoughts? Am I overreacting? Missing something obvious?</div>

    <div class="md">Ahhhh boo hoo.  I've been shadowbanned by the right.  I think it's an automatic algorithm.  It is why there is not much new stuff outside of politics on youtube anymore.  I miss the old youtube as there used to be new gaming stuff coming in all the time now it's just the same ole same ole.  I'm basically locked my account and left.  

The world is pusing for a one world cashless society so if they can make social media on the internet broken then they can tell us 'If you want things to work correctly again use the chip!''. They pushed social media in the first place to get us glued so we will all feel bad when things snowballl and then will want the new chip/mark,whatever they call it where we are in a global ID.

NAFTA signed by Bush and the elite left is a start but at the time we still had enough smart people in Congress that saw thru the bullshit and said NO.  

Obama wanted to (and almost did) put all the coal industry out of business to force us to solar only but all that would've acomplished is severe blackouts as there isn't any way to have enough.  Try doing solar on the Sim City 4 and see how far you get before they can't keep up. Eventually you will have no choice but to put in a gas or coal plant.</div>

This is absolutely false... No charges have been brought in relation to the Trump tower meeting. A meeting that seems to be a set up by Fusion GPS. You do know that the Russian lawyer met with Simpson (CEO or something of Fusion) before and after the infamous meeting, right?
