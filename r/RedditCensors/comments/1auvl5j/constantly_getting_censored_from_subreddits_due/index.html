      <div class="md">Yes I have been banned from my share of Subreddits, but this post is about comment karma and how if you post something thats against the group think of a particular subreddit you get downvoted into oblivion, if you try to respond and argue their comments, you constantly get downvoted again until eventually you reach negative comment karma, and all subreddits require positive karma, and sometimes positive 20+ karma to even post or comment in that subreddit. 

I have had to avoid a lot of subreddits due to this problem, and some subreddits require you to even comment explaining the post, making it so you have no choice but to comment and receive negative karma if you go against the sheep think.

I tried to post in leopards ate my face, right before posting this, I was at +300 comment karma, now im at +32 coment karma, so i got my comments downvoted 270 times within the 20 minutes i had that post up, if I left it up 5 minutes longer I would be in negative karma hell.

This in my opinion is as bad as getting banned from subreddits, because once you get negative karma, you can't even post in regular non crazy subreddits anymore because nearly all require a positive comment karma.

    <div class="md">How big of a troll do you have to be to get downvoted that much. I’ve been banned from my fair share of subs but still have 150k karma in the 2 years I’ve had this account. I mean, even if a comment is at -500 or -1000 they don’t take away more than 100.

I would suggest you remove all subs from your list except those you have a hobby with and enjoy and work up positive subs.</div>
