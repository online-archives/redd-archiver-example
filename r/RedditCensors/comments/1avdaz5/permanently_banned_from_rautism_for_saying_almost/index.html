And to say it’s probably a woman moderator isn’t sexist, it’s just common sense. Who else would get offended at that?</div>

    <div class="md">We can't tell your infliction because its in text. Giving clear indication would have probably stopped you from having gotten banned.

And it's not sexist to say it's probably a woman until you implied it was biased and you also connected it to your "joke".

As it is quite clear that you did not indicate that it was a joke, the banned was deserved.</div>

If there’s something wrong with you and you can’t discern when someone is joking, that’s on you. Everyone else doesn’t have to add a measly “/s” for challenged peoples like yourself.</div>

Do you lose your common sense the second you log into the internet?

    <div class="md">One can be taken as threatening bodily harm, the other is obviously a joke. Did you lose your common sense? These are words on a freaking screen. And your title obviously doesn't match what actually happened. You are clearly trying to cause conflict and stir the pot. This is further shown by how long ago this ban happened. You did this so that it would make tracking down the actual comment very hard to do so you can create a narrative to fit your story.</div>

    <div class="md">If you see an off the wall comment and your first thought isn’t “that person is probably joking,” then you most likely live a very sad and delusional life filled with you confirming your perceived negativities of the world at any chance you get.

The same way you’ve just made up a story in your head about this post. You just get off on seeing controversy don’t you? I can’t imagine how sad your life is.

It’s the internet, and Reddit, for one. If you see a crazy comment, the chances someone is joking is a lot higher than them not joking.</div>

    <div class="md">That is extremely rich coming from you. You purposely posted about a ban from almost 5 months ago so that it is a lot harder to find your actual comment that you made. You think a ambiguous "joke" can be taken as just that without any clear context that it was in fact a joke. You obviously, and this is quite obvious, tried to create a narrative in YOUR favor but when you immediately get called out on it, you result to insulting and belittling the person who did so.

I do not personally know who you are. I cannot take your comments and joke and mere face value. The fact that you thought that nobody would use common sense and see through your extremely veiled attempt is sad.</div>

    <div class="md">Did it ever occur to you that I just found this subreddit and decided to contribute?

Like, how in your peabrain do you come to the conclusion that I waited 140 days specifically to post about this?

There’s clearly something wrong with you and you don’t think logically. I had no idea this subreddit existed until today, then decided to post the time I was censored on Reddit.

And you keep saying “a lot harder” to track the comment, even if it was a day since my ban you wouldn’t find it because they deleted the comment obviously…

The fact you don’t believe I’m telling the truth is only further proof I was censored for no reason, so thank you for your disbelief LMAO. You acknowledge it’s such a silly reason that you think there has to be more to it. Nope… the title is the truth, deal with it.</div>
