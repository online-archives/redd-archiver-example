    <div class="md">According to their message, posting screenshots of public facebook pages without censoring the names is considered "personal information".  So if I took a screenshot of a politician saying something controversial on their public facebook page, that would be considered "revealing personal information".

Still, the whole of the «WhitePeopleTwitter» subreddit doesn't remove names from their posts and they are allowed to have 2.3 million subscribers.  So obviously that rule, like apparently everything else on the site, is merely a technicality which is used to ban inconvenient information.

Note also they say that if I return with the "same motive".  In other words, on this account I don't even actually have to break the rules, because they can just claim that I was planning to do so at any time.</div>

    <div class="md">It seems to me that there are a LOT powerusers/powermods/admins who are either pedophiles or pro-pedophile.

However, my post mentioned two separate people.  One is a powermod account which mods several hundred subreddits.

The other is an admin with an "interesting" resume, including working for a pro-war think tank and working for the government of a foreign nation.</div>

    <div class="md">That's true.

You can make your own subreddit after 1 month on the site, I think.  However you need a 3-month account to take over an abandoned subreddit.  During that time, there are millions of ways to get suspended.

If you get banned from a mainstream sub, you automatically get reported to the admins and can get suspended.

If you post something that someone doesn't like, you can get mass-reported and get suspended.

Heck, even if you get too much karma you can get accused of being a spammer/karma farmer and get suspended.</div>
