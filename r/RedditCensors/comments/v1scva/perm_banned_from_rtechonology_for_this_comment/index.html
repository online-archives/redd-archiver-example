    <div class="md">That's hideous that these assholes think they're on the Left. Imagine banning someone from speaking for making the tamest criticism. Imagine being the moderator of a....forum. A fucking forum. And having skin that thin. What a vindictive, anti-intellectual, zealot. The dumb American cultural pseudo-left are the reason most average people find the Left repulsive. In advanced,civilized countries, with parliamentary democracies, we could abandon these shallow cretins who are mostly just under-educated rich kids that don't know how insulated and propagandized they are yet.</div>

    <div class="md">The Twitter acquisition actually unmasked a lot of dangerous people to the point they are openly against free speech without shame now.  Gone are the days of "I disagree with what you say but I will defend your right to say it" and now it's become "I'll violently attack anyone I don't agree with"

Extremists have jumped off the deep end.

It doesn't surprise me that reddit is being managed by those dangerous extremists.  The site's owners have cultivated this danger.</div>

I don't know about literal physical attack, but violent words? Sure. 

I am a very liberal person, but I just graduated a graduate program and I must say you are almost correct as to college campuses in my experience. I've seen speakers and music artists uninvited from campus due to student uproar. I never understood why people think banning one particular viewpoint from one particular forum will accomplish anything other than making constituents of that viewpoint angrier and more resolved to spread through alternate means.</div>

    <div class="md">If you look at it through the lens of history, it makes more sense.  Attacking viewpoints is how extremists get started.  By the time they get to the middle, you know all about the physical attacks and by the end those extremists are coming up with new ways to carry out exterminations at various degrees of scale.

This isn't a new phenomena.  It repeats every few decades throughout the globe.  It usually doesn't reach the middle part without great opposition and rarely manages to get to their endgame stage, but when it does nobody ever forgets.</div>
