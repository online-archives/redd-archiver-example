      <div class="md">Context: a video of teenagers ransacking a store and stealing things. Most of them appear to have dark skin and predictably people start talking about race. I chime in explaining it is about culture and has nothing to do with race. The first deleted comment you see is not mine. I only made the one comment.

10+ year account with (AFAIR) no history of bans on publicfreakout. I think other than this my only other bans in 10+ years are /Pyongyang and /thedonald, plus a 3 day ban in /Canada for saying both liberals and conservatives were morons. Dozens or hundreds of previous comments in publicfreakout over the years.

Look at the message I got. Permanent ban, no appeal allowed, no replies allowed, any communication is considered "abuse". This mod is either terribly confused or malicious.</div>

    <div class="md">Nope. Again, describing the type of society the encompasses all populations within, including parts of that society that doesn't engage in crime in the same way is not a description of the environment these activities happen in.

    <div class="md">I was trying to come up with common traits of societies where these subcultures exist. I think that last was fairly accurate on that basis.

>There's a difference in neighborhoods that have high crime and low crime. What is it? You can do it!

I would say lots of factors like culture, poverty, education, etc.

And my comment that is the topic of this post was specifically about the culture part.

For the 2nd time, I would suggest you just say what you think instead of playing this interrogation game. It's a really ineffective way to communicate.</div>

One of these greatly affects the other two.

Think of it like a game show. Except the prize is not being a racist instead of money.</div>

Exactly, that is the point of this post - they were very clearly wrong to ban me for explicitly arguing against a racist theory. Can you produce any quote from my comment that is racist, or even a tenuous explanation of why anything I said could remotely be interpreted as racist? Anything? Did you even read it?

P.S. Username most definitely does NOT check out</div>

Woops, you completely misrepresented your own source. The study days exactly the opposite of what you just said. 

How can one person operate in bad faith this much. It's incredible.

"Here is a summary of key findings:

Educational and Economic Attainment: Adults in the second generation are doing better than those in the first generation in median household income ($58,000 versus $46,000); college degrees (36% versus 29%); and homeownership (64% versus 51%). They are less likely to be in poverty (11% versus 18%) and less likely to have not finished high school (10% versus 28%). Most of these favorable comparisons hold up not just in the aggregate but also within each racial/ethnic subgroup (e.g., second-generation Hispanics do better than first-generation Hispanics; second-generation whites do better than first-generation whites, and so on)."</div>
