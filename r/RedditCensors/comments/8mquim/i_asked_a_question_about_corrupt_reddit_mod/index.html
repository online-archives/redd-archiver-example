    <div class="md">Cringe Anarchy seems to have good mods because I don't know who they are, never see them, and have never really seen any one get banned.

It's probably one of the best subreddits on the site, without equal.

A lot of people don't like the content, but I like that aspect (that people are mad) about the subreddit.</div>

    <div class="md">This isn't really censorship. You just broke one of the rules. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_5- "Posts asking users to shame or call out specific people or groups of people will be removed because they lead to witchhunting rather than discussion."

Asking people for stories about "corrupt reddit mods" clearly violates the rule.

There are a lot of times that reddit does really censor things. But this isn't one of them.</div>

T_D is a fan club. It's not a sub for discussion.

Expect to be moderated in there.

When will people learn and stop bringing it up as being censorship.</div>

    <div class="md">No, they go beyond that. 

I've been banned from there twice, one of which I managed to get over turned. I don't support Israel enough to be the true T_D patriot they want.

I got banned from Ask_TheDonald just this weekend for mentioning that Trump got his start by receiving tax breaks from New York City. The discussion was about why Tax Breaks are good. I'm pretty sure Trump thinks tax breaks are good, and I got banned for supporting tax breaks... from a Donald Trump subreddit. 

I've always been a Trump supporter, but it doesn't seem to matter much if you happen to string together the words they don't want to read. A lot like leftists actually. I told them that, and I think it triggered them. They upgraded my ban from 30 days, to permanent on the face of that comment.</div>

    <div class="md">The Ask-Donald piece, fair enough.. if you're getting banned for an open discussion, that's ridiculous. 

I'm in you're boat as well, I'm a supporter, but not a T_D level supporter. 

They've taken that sub to another level, I'm not subbed to it, nor will I.

    <div class="md">No, /politics attempts to represent themselves as unbiased, when in reality it's totally a ShareBlue propaganda outlet.

T_D never claimed to be anything but a cheer leading sub for Trump.

There is absolutely no comparison. </div>

    <div class="md">Go to writingprompts and post pictures of kittens. Go to highqualitygifs and submit pictures of sculptures and art. Subreddits have themes. 

T_D is a sub about being fully dedicated to the current POTUS Donald Trump. If you post anything there not fully supportive of Donald Trump, it would be silly to not expect to get it removed and banned.

It is nothing like politics because unlike r/politics, it does not hide behind a neutral name and pretend to be neutral. It says what it is up front. Politics pretends to represent all of Reddit, then heavily censors the posts and comments and claims "this is just how Reddit is it's not censorship just cuz the site doesn't agree with you hurr durr".

Your ask_td ban might be the only one technically ok to bitch about, though I posit they get whiny cucks whining at them all day every day and have much less patience for backchat than they used to when they made the sub.</div>
