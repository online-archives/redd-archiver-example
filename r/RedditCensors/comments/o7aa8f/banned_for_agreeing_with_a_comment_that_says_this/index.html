Genuinely, what the fuck does that have to do with science being able to make dudes pregnant.

&gt;in America you have the right to choose your own definition

Just because someone calls themselves a female (or male) doesn't make it so, there's so much more to it than just a label, biology for one thing, chromosomes etc..

If it makes someone happy to label themselves, then fine, but it doesn't necessarily make it true, see the attack helicopter defence</div>

    <div class="md">It doesn't have to do with science making dudes pregnant, it was a reply to your question. (In parethesis)

My point is there a many reasons to want children; does it really matter to you what someone else does with their own person? 

Whether they are by your definition a male or female doesn't matter to them. Just like their definition shouldn't matter to you. 

What matters is that they have a right to decide for themselves.</div>

Stick to the topic, language is subject to change and development. The dictionary is coming out with new words and definitions every year. You're gatekeeping language evolution. You literally can't fight change, why try? Genuinely, what's the point?</div>

    <div class="md">Certain highly vocal and very aggressive factions of the trans community have completely co-opted the majority of women's subs on reddit.

Any sub that disagreed with this abuse were banned or quarantined by the admins, sometime last year i believe.

Official reddit policy is that biological science is irrelevant, and saying otherwise is ban worthy.</div>

    <div class="md">Yep, I've seen some comments on my post that said "Only biological females can give birth" and poof, they're removed. These SJWs are apparently not capable of holding a meaningful discussion nor possess any sense of logic, people like these just make it hard for me to take the trans community seriously.</div>

    <div class="md">it's reddit, remember the loudest people, remember who the admins and mods are..lol

Also keep this in mind, twitters content is from the same 5% or less, and they are the protected "agenda" people. It's no different here. It's a bunch of last-picked, losers, wallflowers, self-made victims, socially inept, romantically lonely, absolute fucking real world zeroes who are trying their best to lower every bar instead of bringing themselves up. 

There are two genders, females aka: women, can give birth and carry babies.. not men, aka: males.</div>

    <div class="md">Agree, these pathetic losers are willing to work for free 5 hours a day on Reddit in exchange for a itsy bitsy amount of power to dictate people's speech. I wouldn't be surprised if they're also the ones crying about the gender pay gap.</div>
