**DO NOT CONTACT THE MODERATORS UNTIL YOU HAVE READ THIS MESSAGE IN FULL.**

Your comment was removed because your account is either new or has low karma.

**ALL posts and comments must:**     \- **Follow rule 4: Keep discussion civil** \- no insults, mocking, or personal attacks. **NO EXCEPTIONS.**     \- **Follow Reddit's TOS** (described below).

For reference, **any** of the following will be considered a violation, and is **not permitted**:

&amp;#x200B;

* Stating or implying that certain races are statistically more likely  to commit specific types of crime, or crimes in general, than other  races (i.e. **race-based crime statistics**)
* **Criticizing, mocking, or expressing contempt towards any protected groups/communities**, or stating or implying anything that portrays them in a negative manner as compared to the general population
* Stating or implying that racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia is  either justified or should be acceptable, or stating anything that is  objectively racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic, or encouraging others  to be racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic
* Stating or implying that there exist **differences in average intelligence or IQ for different races** or regions
* Stating or implying that certain races are less civilized than other races
* Stating or implying that **trans (wo)men are not (wo)men**, or otherwise indicating that people are not the gender they identify as (or openly disagreeing with this rule specifically)
* Making fun of people's pronoun requests, refusing to abide by them, or criticizing/disagreeing with them
* Stating or implying that being or wanting to be trans/the opposite gender is a **mental illness** or disorder
* **Making negative generalizations** about any  demographic/religious/ethnic/protected group, or making positive  generalizations about non-protected groups (note: "more likely to"  counts as a generalization in this context if referring to a protected  group)
* Advocating for violence towards any group, or the removal of rights from a specific group (except as a punishment for a crime).
* Comparing BLM to the KKK or other terrorist organizations, or  portaying/mentioning mob or race-based violence committed by a protected  group
* Encouraging users to communicate or do anything that would violate any of these rules

If your comment follows both rule 4 and Reddit's TOS, you may request that the moderators reinstate it.

Do request reinstatement, please send us **A LINK** to the comment via modmail.

**PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE A LINK WHEN YOU MESSAGE US.**

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please* [*contact the moderators of this subreddit*](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion) *if you have any questions or concerns.*

This TOS is clearly not evenly applied, just try having two accounts and violate the terms from left and from right, you'll find your right account dies first!</div>

    <div class="md">I got banned from commenting from a forum and I had said nothing bad. I got the notice saying to contact a moderator with any questions. So I messaged asking about why as my comment wasn’t inciting or anything. The moderator responded with just a yawn and blocked me from messaging any moderators for a month. 

I think it’s wrong to not allow any explanation or defense and just block because you have the power to do so.</div>

    <div class="md">Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.

What happens when you get water on a table?

It becomes a pool table.</div>

    <div class="md">WATER IS WET.

Why? Because if a water molecule is touching another water molecule (which is always the case) then it is making each other wet.

If a water molecule is not touching another water molecule, then that is steam, and it is dry until it cools down and turns back into water, typically by hitting something, then it is now touching itself and becomings wet.

WATER IS WET.</div>

    <div class="md">Quick question. I know the answer, but I just want to confirm. The rules you posted include things like not saying trans people aren't what they are, not saying given races have lower IQs, not implying that given races naturally commit more crimes, and not making fun of pronoun requests. You have claimed the rules are "leftist."

To clarify, then, would actively doing all these things be a right-leaning thing to do?</div>

    <div class="md">It's more that censorship of speech is a leftist strategy these days.  Some of those things in the TOS essentially forbid any real discussion of crime that includes verifiable statistics.  I know that some people will make of those statistics some contrived explanation such as, "stats show lower average IQ, stats show higher crime, therefore the two are connected directly", and that would be the right wing argument, the left wing argument would be more nuanced but both would fall short of fully evidencing their claims.  The right wing would not censor the use of statistics though, regardless of the point being made.  It's the censoring that makes it leftist.  That's not to say that there are no sensorious right wingers mind you, it's just not at present the right wing who are pushing in that direction.  I am not using the term "leftist" in a technically correct way but in a more general way about where the wind is blowing from.</div>

    <div class="md">Leftists? More like shit and radlibs (who are more like centrists with their apologia and smears of leftists) under neolib and neocon (pro war/imperialism/censorship) leadership, pressured by an authoritarian govt/security state to censor and the FBI and others have targeted both working class and progressives/leftists for decades btw. Many leftists who are critical of the former for being unwitting tools of the latter (or for having dissenting/unpopular takes on Russiagate, covid, Trucker protests, Ukraine, cancel culture or  for criticizing MSM, the security state, the military industrial complex and corporate centrist dems and the dem party) are censored just as you right wingers are. See occupy wall street and BLM being targeted, see astroturf, agent prevacateurs, cointelpro and MLK, Fred Hampton, Malcolm X. You know, folks who wanted actual class solidarity not division among party lines. It's plausible there are some compromised (on the job) mods, even admins, but most just censor and toe the status quo line for free, which is alarming but the groupthink and self censorship is real. Do you see how fast people supposedly on your own side, will turn on you if you question official narratives out your leadership / power centers and seek to hold them accountable?</div>

And the dem party used/manipulated BLM to a attack Bernie in 2015/2016 and then tossed them out recently when it was convenient i.e. when BLM was promoting defund the police (really just reallocating excessive funding from police to other sectors that could really use that money), oh and leaders of the BLM movement sold out.

    <div class="md">Follow the money on BLM and it all becomes clear.  I'm sure there were some useful idiots along the way who thought it would be different, but it was obvious from the start that it wasn't really about black lives mattering, which is why it was astroturfed to my country where white working class are more likely to die in police custody than black people anyway.  I've heard it's the same in the US but I haven't seen state-by-state statistics on that one.</div>

    <div class="md">Liberals are mainstream leftists (aka milquetoast/boutique/limousine left aka cia or synthetic left) who are more like center center-left with caring more about a cultural war than a class war and parrot pro dem establishment, pro imperialism, pro security state, pro partisan anti class solidarity propagandistic talking points, helping to run interference for neolibs and smear the critics of those grifting democrats. Leftists who dare criticize the dem party from the left and seek to hold their leaders (even progressives leaders accountable and to what they ran on.) These 'leftists' tend to be pro censorship, cancel culture, push pro military industrial complex and security state propaganda and smears of critics on the left unwittingly. It's also a label worn by neolibs and neocon democrats who pretend to be leftist. They have co-opted the word 'liberal.' Some of the same folks even go as far to call themselves progressive, like Hillary, Biden, Pelosi and Clyburn. 

Leftists often refer to the former as neolibs or shit and radlibs (not to be confused with the right-wing term 'libtard'), and those democrats as corporate centrists and dinos. The liberal establishment - dem party, liberal MSM, is not leftist or pro working class. Neither is Bernie's socialism this scary thing that both parties want you and I to believe, both dem and rep voters are for Bernie's populist working class policy. Our own govt has targeted leftists and working class activists for decades and saw to stopping 'socialism' in countries that did not fall in line, so then they could point to failures caused by their sabotage as evidence of this scary 'socialism' failing, when the socialism Bernie has promoted is alive and well in other capitalist nations and see their happiness index compared with America.</div>

Wait.. what? 
Are you still new to reddit? Self-named liberals on reddit will tell you they want last minute abortions, men can play in womens sports and you cannot say anything about that, you can give 5yr olds puberty blockers and tell them they can pick any gender (but nobody ever transitions into anything other than 1 of the 2 actual genders..weird, right?) an open border without any regard for who we let in. Which group would say "my body my choice" and then say the opposite against a forced drug that doesnt work (see Biden 2021 on the "vaccines" vs 2022 and getting Covid). 

The old liberals are what you're describing, today's reddit-type of liberals are far gone man. Old liberals are my father, he was a hippie, he wanted less government, less censorship, more actual open discussions, more integration -today's liberals are trying to have minority-only graduations/safe spaces, heavy censorship by calling everything they dont like "hate speech", and going along with everything the govt says and giving the govt more power.

Where are these people on reddit? I seriously do not see the subs/posts/people

I need examples still, give me a reddit liberal ideal vs a reddit leftist ideal.. then, and we don't have to do this, be a leftist or a liberal and go against one of the mainstream left/lib ideas..say for example, "I am a liberal and I want a closed and secure border to defend against illicit drugs and the violent drug trade and human trafficking".. and see if you get downvoted and/or kicked out. If there is a difference between a reddit/social media loud/protestor loud/rioter loud liberal and a leftist, I promise you we don't know what that is.</div>

    <div class="md">New to Reddit? Not at all. Classic liberals are like what Joe Rogan is. Todays liberals are neolibs and neocon dems who are fake leftists and leftists (shit/radlibs) who parrot the former's propaganda - enabling class division and division among even the left and who run interference for their own leaders even when they do not fight for what they ran on because... Republicans/Trump. This site is like one big liberal establishment (neolib/neocon dem) propaganda board and when I say that I am not saying it is leftist, though I would argue most of the users are in fact leftists.

I remember when the politics and political humor sub was upvoting stuff critical of Hillary and the democratic party (even Obama) and stuff favoring Tulsi, Nader even Ron and Rand Paul. I think it started or really ramped up (in terms of astroturf, paid for likes/votes/reports and censorship) in 2015/2016 and has been getting worse ever since.</div>
