&gt;Canada a full democracy? Did you see how Trudeau and MSM in Canada (and the US) treated the protesting truckers?? and the United States isn't even a democracy, it's been described as a republic but it's more like a kleptocracy / corporatocracy. The post is propaganda making countries like US and Canada out to be democracies when they have an authoritarian government (see govt backed big tech censorship or security state targeting socialists and civil rights leaders), low press freedom index, target whistleblowers, MSM that is basically state tv, black sites, guantanamo, militarization of the police / police state and prison industrial complex. See how many folks are in prison in the US. We have so many people in prison and homeless living under bridges, and look where the middle class has gone, people are in poverty living paycheck to paycheck and don't have money for a medical emergency. Both political parties are right wing anti worker pro war parties who put big money donors and special interests (including MIC) over the voters and average American. Both parties push anti third party propaganda (just like MSM who also pushes partisan propaganda to promote division and repel class solidarity) and work to undermine/subvert democracy to stop progressive candidates. It's convenient that the post paints enemies or non allies of the west and NATO as authoritarian regimes. It's neolib/neocon propaganda where any country they do not like is an authoritarian regime that needs changing, that is how the Hillary type dem crowd talk foreign policy. 

But forgot the bit about dems blocking 3rd parties on the ballot / getting them kicked off.

To this thread;

https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/10rm8h6/the_economist_has_released_their_2023_decomocracy

I noticed my post from earlier was not showing up. I messaged the mods, 15 minutes goes by and no reply. I know, large sub, but has a lot of mods. I reposted my comment saying I had my previous reply removed without explanation. 1 minute later my new comment was removed and I got a temp ban reason 'counter moderation.' I messaged the mods with: 

&gt;Counter moderation? You removed a post without explanation and gave no explanation when asked. Was the ban for inquiring as to why it was removed without explanation?? Arbitrarily removing posts based on 1) targeted report abuse 2) personal political bias, is shameful moderation. Another sub ruined by authoritarian mods who want to shut down open debate. 

They replied within 2 minutes with:

&gt;Yes, counter moderation. You knew something had been removed and instead of waiting for an answer as to why it was removed, you opted to post the removed content again. Hence the temporary ban.

So they took quick action and replied to me fast now but couldn't be bothered to reply to my inquiry over a removal. My guess is they were either looking for a rule to cover the post removal after the fact or they were never planning on giving me an explanation. Either way, I said fuck it because I see far worse posts still up and this reeked of mods either giving into report abuse or they were arbitrarily removing the post because they just disagree with the sentiment and don't want open debate. I said I can't wait for Reddit leaks to drop so everyone can see how these authoritarian scumbag mods operate and was quickly muted and the temp ban turned to a permanent one.</div>

Edit: Here is you defending me being banned from another sub:

Nobody finds it weird the amount pro censorship people who post here and they are often upvoted while those documenting censorship and mod abuse are downvoted? Almost like vote manipulation and report abuse are a thing, just like astroturf.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;It wouldn't surprise me if he's on some kind of mod watchlist/blacklist.

Yeah I would not be surprised. Be it a list by powermods, the anti evil operations folks (ironic name since they love censorship - it like an anti hate subreddit acting like a hate subreddit) or admins. I know I have had stuff removed from both democraticsocialism and politics and mods of both told me it wasn't them who did the removing but suggested it was a sitewide algorithm and to speak to an admin. I have also been unsubscribed from subs, though this could be a malfunction of redditisfun app. One mod told me they thought I was mistakenly  caught up by the spam filter (which didn't make much since when only certain comments with presumably keywords, were removed. Another mod suggested (like you) that I was on an list / had a note by my name, be it by mistake or because of what I post politically. After seeing the Twitter files, I am inclined to believe it could be true and done intentionally not because I post often but because of my political and foreign policy stance. While not doubting the possibility of the above, I would say it's likely my removals and bans have more to due with report abuse and arbitrary bans over political bias and less to do with being on a list and or having a flair next to my name, but I could be wrong. It could also be both things. This other user here thinks I deserve it and am imagining mod abuse, how can you seriously look at all the bans I've documented and say I deserved every single one. I wouldn't post about them here if I felt I deserved them and in none of these instances did I intentionally try to get banned.</div>

    <div class="md">Here is you defending me being banned from another sub:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/106h9v6/permanently_banned_from_rdsa_without_explanation/j3ir6hf/

It's like pro censorship folks posting to declineintocensorship or authoritarian folks posting to descentintotyranny or pro war people posting to endlesswar. Just why? To try and character assasinate and discredit people posting to these places in good faith because you disagree with them politically? What is it?</div>
