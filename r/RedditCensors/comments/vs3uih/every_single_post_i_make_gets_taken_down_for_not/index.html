      <div class="md">I have made multiple posts on here in AITA, nosleep, advice, unpopularopinions, etc, and almost every single one gets taken down for some “rule violation.” AITA constantly asks me to explain how I would be TA, and when I give a response that a bot or mod doesn’t like, they shut me down, no ability to resubmit. They censor you to an extreme point. Multiple of my posts on unpopularopinions have been taken down for not being unpopular… despite the fact that they ARE unpopular opinions. The mod I spoke to about one of the most recent ones was rude and frustrating. My post on nosleep wouldn’t even post to begin with! I had to contact the mods who then said it’s not “believable” despite having multiple stories on there that are not believable in the slightest… monsters that rip out your guts if you look at them are somehow believable, yet my post (that could legitimately happen) isn’t?? At this point I’m about to leave Reddit. I was so excited to join cause I thought I was allowed to contribute, but apparently not. There are topics such as SA that are censored despite it being a VERY prevalent issue in today’s society. Very very frustrating!</div>

    <div class="md">Imo you should be able to say whatever you want to whomever you want as long as it's not clearly definable as libel, blackmail, or threats of violence.

Censorship is dumb as hell. Frankly, being racist is also within people's rights, employment and hate crime cases aside.

I don't deny the truth in favor of pleasant fantasies, so I believe there is some truth to stereotypes, therein not all aspects of racism are inherently flawed.

But you won't see many people arguing the merits of discrimination, even though it's a skill we're taught and a formation that does largely follow causal patterns in our brains.</div>
