    <div class="md">There’s something deeply disturbing about the SJW movement and what they’ve been doing movies and video games. They don’t care about inclusivity or anything, they just want to ruin things where the primary demographic is white males. Alex Becker made a great analogy about this; what’s happening is like Cosmo magazine suddenly putting pictures of WWE wrestlers on their covers and then telling their customers not to buy the magazine if they don’t like it.</div>
