      <div class="md">I've posted there for a while and never had any issues.

So they removed my post here:

https://np.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/nbreee/coronavirus_most_likely_escaped_from_lab_former

I replied to someone in the thread and was downvoted pretty quickly. I am not pro-Trump or anti-China btw.

I inquired showing that I posted something similar days ago on the same topic and that post was *not* removed. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/n9fcrk/saagar_enjeti_new_details_reveal_fauci_media 

I pointed this out and said what gives? This isn't misinformation if that is what it is being reported as. I said Just curious why my post here was removed and I've never known this sub to censor stuff. 

Later I posted:

https://np.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/nc1dtt/the_wuhan_lableak_hypothesis_deserves_relentless/

Which I had posted to another leftie sub, and that post appears to still be up over there. 

I then logged back on later today and received a message:

You've been permanently banned from lostgeneration with reason given rule #4

Rules 4: "Anti-Reactionary Policy: Anti-working class rhetoric and ideologies that attempt to institute, defend, or excuse oppression are heavily policed. Promotion of nazism, fascism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, sexism, xenophobia, eco-fascism, orientalism, antinatalism, eugenics, anti-semitism, dominionism, neoliberalism, and market fundamentalism, will not be tolerated."

And I had also been muted so I could not contest the ban and ask how exactly my post or comment violated this rule and warrant the perma ban. I've never even received so much as a warning at this place, but this is often how these things go, apparently.</div>

    <div class="md">Well this is from the "science" journal that was linked in the comments of the post that got OP banned. 

"Although there were no findings in clear support of either a natural spillover or a lab accident, the team assessed a zoonotic spillover from an intermediate host as “likely to very likely,” and a laboratory incident as “extremely unlikely” " 

Yet somehow they still come to a BS conclusion that it was most likely a laboratory accident even though there's literally 0 evidence to support it even in their own findings.

Maybe, just maybe they're grasping for straws.</div>

    <div class="md">They banned me perm for saying “a broken clock is right twice a day” in regards to alleged fascists donating to the memorial for victims of communism in Canada.

I support workers and all the other things in rule 4. My family is from the former Yugoslavia and I could tell you volumes about how workers suffered under the tyranny of authoritarian gov. 

Workers don’t benefit from censorship or mandatory hive mind. The gatekeeping from auth left is exactly why they feel lost imo. 

This is the revolutionary mindset I guess. Any disagreement is a label as fascist. F</div>

    <div class="md">Well the former CDC head was a Trump party shill and has next to zero credibility today. Just like this bullshit theory. If you want to hear someone who actually knows what they're talking about look up Michael Osterholm. He wrote a book on what a virus just like Covid-19 would act like and where it would come from back in 2017.

He is hardly the only one to suggest it is possible or even plausible.

Then there's the other post to that sub about the same topic, which wasn't removed, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pk0wLN5uuU

What you think about the former head of the CDC, whether it's true or not, does not justify censorship. Especially not when this theory is corroborated by others in the field who do not seem politically motivated. To ignore them would mean YOU are politicizing this rather than coming at it with skepticism and using critical thought.  

Edit: There's been a number of virologists who have suggested this theory/hypothesis has merit and to my knowledge, they are not right-wing/shills for Trump. I don't see the issue with the speculation. What is your agenda here? Accused everyone who is rightfully skeptical of the official narrative of being Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists?</div>

    <div class="md">He (Sanjay Gupta) doesn't suggest whether or not it's possible in the video you shared. He just suggests that the CDC head may have access to classified Intel that could lead to that conclusion. Even then the clip is obviously taken out of context. So there's still no evidence of any kind. 

Their only argument is that if you ask an expert who dedicated their life to learning and educating themselves on a specific subject, you can't just take their answer at face value. At that point what's even the point of having doctors and researchers? Obviously these news casters have the answers.

Edit: 

But you deserve to be banned for spreading un-proven theories while dissenting the opinion of health professionals. This puts people at risk and is common reactionary behavior.</div>

No, I don't think it did as the official narrative - which is spread as fact - has not yet been proven. How is that then not also an unproven theory? How am I putting anyone at risk by posting something the former CDC head said? I posted his opinion and then speculation about that opinion and about the holes in the official narrative, that is all.</div>
