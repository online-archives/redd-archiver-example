I thought I posted atleast one video to this sub recently, like in the last month. Anyways, no explanation. I replied to the ban message asking what I did to deserve this ban... that I don't even know what I did.

I also had a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/rx3cg9/censorship_and_the_future_of_the_internet) about internet censorship (by second thought) removed from videos as being political, just as they removed moon's [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/lsb4w6/rvideos_removes_reddit_is_cringe_the_story_of_why) about reddit. Anything discussing history of reddit, mod abuse, censorship, press freedom etc is labeled as politics. They also removed a history video without explanation, but that may be automod. I have experienced this there before and elsewhere, where they just remove stuff that doesn't clearly violate the rules, which is weird because some similar content I post there and to movies, music etc did not get removed. And 99% of the time I never hear back from mods when inquiring over removals. I think it's probably a mixture of good faith users being wrongly censored by automod to automod removing stuff based on certain words or phrases (due to algorithm set by mods or a mod) or over bogus reports by people to get certain content and or opinions removed. Similarly, you have mods censoring content (and people who post content) which they disagree with, regardless of whether it violates the rules. You also have I think lazy mods who sign off on automod censorship, then defend it when people inquire or just don't reply at all. They may just ban you for inquiring and questioning the removal, whether it was just or not. I wonder what admins think about all this censorship. My guess is they are fine with it.

Edit: So this is the video I posted there recently https://np.reddit.com/r/InterestingVideoClips/comments/s1f0p2/the_tragic_tale_of_reddit and I see it's been removed. I'm guessing that is what prompted the ban, though I don't see why posting it warranted a perma ban and 5 days after the fact. Strange they didn't also remove my comment within that thread if they found the post so controversial.

I don't see any rules in the old sidebar. In the new sidebar I see:

&gt;Cool, funny, weird &amp; interesting videos. --- Please be generous with your karma and remember to upvote the videos and comments you like. That'll make this place more fun for everyone. Thanks! :)
