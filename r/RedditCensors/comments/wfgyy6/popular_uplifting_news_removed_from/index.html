No response back from mods on the issue.

Edit: Checked my inbox and this was in it:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/UpliftingNews. You can still view and subscribe to r/UpliftingNews, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;&gt;Inciting a brigade

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/UpliftingNews by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

Note: It's been 4 days since I messaged them about the removals. I made this post here 3 days after not hearing back from them.

I replied to this message with:

"??? You removed posts without explanation, did not respond to inquiry via modmail and I used NP in my links which means Non participation, that is the opposite of 'inciting a brigade' that is telling people to NOT brigade. So you permanently ban me over my totally valid complaints of your censorship which you failed or refused to address? Holy shit."

How much do you want to bet that the same type of folks who reported those two posts to that sub to get them removed (likely report/automod abuse), are the same type who reported my post here to get me banned from that sub? Totally despicable behavior and same goes for the mod who assists them.

Got a reply:

&gt;If you don’t get a response, your recourse is to send a follow up- not invite a brigade.

&gt;You broke the ToS with your community interference, and are reaping the just regards.

I responded wtih:

"I did not brigade. I documented your censorship in a sub meant for that and I marks my posts NP, that is not inviting a brigade. No, I did NOT violate ToS and if you want to talk about community interference, please talk to the users who bogus report content and abuse automod to get it removed and talk of mods who assist in this by turning a blind eye or themselves remove content over political bias and agenda."

They wrote back:

&gt;Your post caused more than one user to harass and follow moderators across Reddit, with the sole intention of harassing them over your post.

&gt;"I told them not to do that."

&gt;It doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter to Reddit. You broke the ToS. Live with it.

I replied:

"That sucks and it sucks to have my content censored and to be banned over complaining about censorship. You should block them and or report them to admins, but I wrote NP in my links and documenting censorship is the purpose of redditcensors."

"No, I did not. I did not call for a brigade, I wrote NP in the links which tells people NOT TO VOTE OR COMMENT. Please be my guest to message the admins about this and let them look into it, I welcome it because I didn't call for you to be brigaded or harassed and I don't condone those actions either."

Note to readers: please do NOT vote or comment in these links despite them being posts that were already removed and please do NOT brigade that sub or harass the mods there. I have always stated this in previous posts here if there was any questions to my intent. I don't even know which mod it is that I am speaking to now, so If they are really now being harassed over my post here, I am genuinely curious how these multiple people (?) are harassing the mod responsible for removing the posts, without knowing which mod was responsible.

Got a quick reply back:

&gt;Your intentions are moot. The outcome, however, isn't.

&gt;Your post and your post ALONE caused people to get threats and harassment- harassment that would've never happened, had you just followed up with a "Hey, can I please get an answer on this?"

&gt;Actions have consequences.

&gt;This is no longer up for discussion.

&gt;Never contact us again, for any reason whatsoever, as your queries will fall upon deaf ears.

Now it's threats? WTF?? And I am now not going to message them back as they will then report me to admins for harassment if they haven't already just for me making this post. If they're being honest, that is fucked up and again, I don't condone harassment or threats. None of that changes their subs censorship, lack of responding to modmail and then permanently banning people when they document this crap.</div>

I am using the redditisfun app and I don't see any rule in the sidebar of upliftingnews against political posts. Plus I see other posts in that sub that are political in nature and are still up. Can you explain this? Your argument is that my post was removed for being political... not bogus reports that abuse automod to censor or biased mods/admins removing content arbitrarily?

I am not against same sex marriage btw.

And I have a bone to pick with that sort of rule anyways (no politics) because what is and isn't political, exactly, how is it not subjective? Many things revolve around or involve politics. This seems like a rule that may be used to suppress information and control the conversation while under the guise of preventing drama, you are in reality preventing healthy debate and enlightenment.

I see in there sidebar they list under friends of upliftingnews! Joe Rogan of all people - who you apparently don't like and shit talk and smear. Claiming he is crazy/a moron/a joke/bad/100% a conservative/a Trumpist, despite him saying he liked Bernie's policy and said he would vote for him.

https://np.reddit.com/r/LibertarianUncensored/comments/w8xwao/joe_reviews_tiktoks_crazy_terms_of_service/ihttnu0

AFAIK Rogan is an admitted liberal (appears to the left of moderate corporate-centrist dems - who are actually right-wing) and he is what I imagine a traditional liberal looks like, not like today's 'liberal' e.g. neolib/neocon democrats like Biden or Hillary - who consider themselves liberals.

Those links provide evidence that challenge the claims you made about Rogan.

The purpose of THIS sub is to document censorship and that is precisely what I have done. Why would someone who is seemingly pro-censorship, be hanging out in an anti-censorship sub? Can you answer that?

Edit: and here is you advocating for imperialism:

    <div class="md">Lmfao you have FAR too much time on your hands if you’re going through peoples’ post history to try and find stuff you disagree with. 

I don’t know for a fact that your post was removed for being political, it was just a guess. I’m not a mod. Chill out dude. 

To briefly entertain your fishing expedition into my comment history: yes Rogan is a joke, a moron, a conservative, and a trumpist. Maybe you should have read my comments more closely, and you would have seen that I explicitly stated that I USED to like him. He USED to be relatively sane and rational. That was the era where he supported Bernie, 2016, 2018 ish. He has totally changed since then. Hence, I’m not a fan any more. Every once in a while I’ll try an episode but I can’t even get more than a few minutes in before I’m cringing at just how unbelievably *dumb* he is. A middle schooler could debunk or counter half of the bullshit he spews. If at this stage you *still* believe that Rogan is a smart, reasonable, liberal dude, than I can only assume that you’re also a moron. I’m 100% aware of the distinction between actual liberals and the modern democratic party that has hijacked the term and used it to describe their blatantly illiberal policies. Rogan is neither. None of what I’ve said is supporting tiktok. Tiktok is cancer, and a literal spy tool and propaganda machine of the CCP. 

Where are you getting the idea that I’m pro-censorship? I am very much not. 

And no, I am not pro-imperialist. Saying that it was a moral duty to prevent a dictator from murdering hundreds of thousands of his civilians isn’t pro-imperialist. That’s human decency. If you lived under a murderous dictator like that, you’d be wishing on your lucky star that someone would come in and stop a madman from gassing your entire village or burying you and your family alive. 

You need to get off reddit and read a fucking book 😂</div>
