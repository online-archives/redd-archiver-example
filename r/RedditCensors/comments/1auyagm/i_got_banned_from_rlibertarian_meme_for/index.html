    <div class="md">Ukraine is a Buffer State. IN BETWEEN Nato and Russia. If they join Russia, Nato will get mad. If they join Nato, Russia will get mad. 

The safest way to exist is to remain neutral. But for some idiotic reason, their president suddenly chose a side. Facepalm. 

&#x200B;

Wiki described buffer state: 

  
A buffer state is a country geographically lying between two rival or potentially hostile great powers. Its existence can sometimes be thought to prevent conflict between them. 

A buffer state is a mutually agreed upon area lying between two greater powers, which is demilitarized in the sense of not hosting the military of either power (though it will usually have its own military forces). The invasion of a buffer state by one of the powers surrounding it will often result in war between the powers.</div>

>Ukraine being able to decide what international treaties it signs isn’t an anti liberty stance.

Ukraine is free to do what it wants. But like any liberty stance, you must also accept the consequences of your actions.

ie; you live smack dab in the middle of Bloods & Crips territory. You now have 3 choices:  
  
\-join bloods  
  
\-join Crips  
  
\-Don't join at all

    <div class="md">No I enjoy freedom. I don’t enjoy corrupt people in DC taking my money to enrich military contractors. Just send your own money voluntarily. The moral argument can’t involve required force to make neighbors pay for everything you want. 

Just send your own money. No one is stopping you from supporting Ukraine. I got my own bills to pay. Ukraines pensions are being paid for with the foreign aid. I didn’t sign up for that. You’re advocating sending money. You’re so generous with everyone else’s money. Just send your own money since you are such a moral figure.</div>

All of the old equipment we are sending over there was mothballed anyways and it would cost the government more to decommission it than it costs to refurbish and send to Ukraine.

    <div class="md">The Tea Party was a bunch of reactionary fucks who were scared a black man was elected president. What they are today I have no idea. Most went MAGA.

As for libertarians, most of what I've seen of recent libertarians isn't libertarianism.</div>

    <div class="md">Many of the members were reactionary. I’m talking about the ideals behind it that was fostered by people like Ron Paul and those who railed against the ACA and other big government policies that were being implemented in the first two years of the Obama years. That’s what I was comparing to Goldwater. And most went MAGA like you said. Very few people have seen or understand actual libertarianism. Definitely nothing viable in the US.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh, I agree with you. From certain perspectives, they’ll view your stance from their own bias. Most will see Ukraine joining NATO as a way of aggravating relations and bringing us closer to war and they tend to be against international organizations already. From that POV, they’ll misunderstand your actual point and see it as wanting war with Russia. But that’s due to jumping immediately from how they would view the outcome (like a possible war with Russia in this case, or “taking care of other nations”) rather than your actual point.</div>
