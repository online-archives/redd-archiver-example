    <div class="md">Mod message on that thread:

I don't want to be one to question u/CHAD_J_THUNDERCOCK, but I need confirmation that this change was made recently. If the admins made that edit back when they removed half of the TD mod team, then there were merely being gaslighting trolls. If they removed it since Floyd, then we know they're endorsing the widespread threats against police on their site.

EDIT: The admins are merely gaslighting users. The Wayback Machine shows that the first message existed on [October 3rd, 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191003190110/https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald), but it had been changed to the current message by [November 21st, 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191121183851/https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/). This change, therefore, has nothing to do with the recent protests.

So the riots have been planned at least as long ago as November, 2019. Good catch...</div>
