    <div class="md">The SRS powermod cabal is constantly on the warpath to take over any decent free speech zone that gets halfway popular.  With full admin approval. :(

This has been going on for years. Especially ramped up after the Elen Pao debockle , and recently, holy shit, political groups such as CTR, and now big papa ShareBlue have completely taken over the major politically based subs.  Not to mention anything that gets decent viewer numbers. :(

remember when /politics use to be a *default*?!?   Even the admins can't allow that anymore, that's how poisoned that place is with the political propaganda industry.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, seriously criticizing dedicated circle-jerk subs is kinda low-hanging fruit.

Well, unless they organize / condone very abusive behavior such as SRS &amp; Co. 

Donno of any major doxxing or brigade campaigns from the latestage sub... though they are obviously related to the SRS mob.  

Best keep our eyes on them.

Sad thing is, other dedicated circle-jerk subs like T_D that follow actual reddit rules 1000% better, are  constantly under attack, from admins and various political groups (hello Shareblue) alike. :/   </div>

    <div class="md">Rule from /r/RedditCensors

*Our goal here is exposing ideological censorship and similarly disingenuous modding practices. As such, complaints about subreddits that openly enforce a specific ideology are not suited for this subreddit.*

So, for instance, don't post censorship from /r/Christianity, it's expected that they will censor, but /r/news, that's a target.</div>

    <div class="md">Google is a content host.  

A special interest group, particularly one with an ideology is almost expected to put their fingers in their ears when something they don't want to know crops up.

So it's pretty much expected.  Let them sit in their cocoon and chew on their dogma.

Google doing it could be considered a crime.  I think it is a crime.

So I disagree, not like that at all.</div>

I got in a fight on /r/atheism for not being anti-trump enough.  Fed up with the SJWs on there.  They're supposed to be skeptics and they are as close minded as it gets.  Not worried about being banned though.</div>

    <div class="md">/r/atheism used to be practically censorship free, including trolls.  I liked that.  

Now we seem to be inundated with SJWs and I cannot abide them.  Their xenophobic gender identity and victimology platforms are ideologies.  Atheism, as I said, is just not believing in gods but there is something of an expectation of skepticism, at least by the more intelligent atheists.  That precludes subscribing to ideologies in general, not just religions.

Here's my theory: Years of children never being left unattended, always having an adult around to watch over them, going on 'play dates', getting prizes for coming last, being told that they are special snowflakes all their lives.

Then they go to university and suddenly they have to stand up for themselves, they have to compete, they are in the real world.  And they can't handle it.  To make matters worse, 90% of the professors in universities are liberal, there is no other side of the coin.  These sociology assholes with their identity politics are radicalizing these kids and turning them into SJWs.  They shut down speakers who have opinions they don't want to hear.

Universities are supposed to be places where ideas are challenged, not shut down.  This whole thing drives me fucking crazy.

The University of Chicago has declared that they will not be serving up trigger warnings or safe spaces.  Send your children there.

Sorry, that rant just wanted to come out.</div>
