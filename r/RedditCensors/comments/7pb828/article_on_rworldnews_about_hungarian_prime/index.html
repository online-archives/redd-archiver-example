    <div class="md">A lot of these comments are totally fair to both sides and dont use slurs or insults, and they're still being removed. Can we get an explanation u/Fluttershy_qtest u/WorldNewsMods u/BritishEnglishPolice please can any one of you explain why a comment like this is removed?

&gt;But they are concentrated, and together with magnitude higher birth rate than the natives. Not integrating is a huge problem. In the short term, none integration leads to poor economic outlook. Poor economic outlook leads to poverty. Poverty breeds resentment, from both the Muslims as well as the French natives who have to support them through subsidies (their tax dollar). Resentment will inflame and add fuel to extremists on both sides. In the long term, with much much MUCH higher birth rate. None integration in a few generations would cause tremendous problem in local politics and then few generations later, strongly influence the country's politics as a whole. Despite the platitudes of apologists, the fact is, there are values Muslims hold, especially muslims from undeveloped countries hold, that are not compatible with western liberal democracies. Just look to the migrant's home country for the best example.</div>

    <div class="md">Been to Vienna and Budapest.  After seeing Vienna, I had to pause and ask if it was actually Vienna, Austria or a Disney set.  So many foreigners!

Thankfully Budapest doesn’t have that since folks there make less money and live largely in communist buildings, making the city less enticing to foreigners.  Hungary also built a trump wall on its Serbian border.  It’s like they are expecting an invasion.  They have gates on wheels that can be slammed shut on a moment’s notice.  If you drive from Serbia to hungary they will check your car’s trunk to make sure you didn’t bring stowaways along.  

Immigration opinions aside, I think not talking about these issues and just forcing one a one sided narrative(immigration = good, anyone who thinks otherwise is a hater) is plain wrong.  </div>

    <div class="md">That kind of sounds like a threat to dox. This is some incredibly rampant censorship that Reddit is allowing on one of the largest subs out there, and I disagree with it 100%, but doxing, or advocating for it, is just as wrong in my book and is against site wide rules.

Not a threat. I don't have the means...but you're the mod so it's your call. 

&gt; but doxing, or advocating for it, is just as wrong in my book and is against site wide rules. 

In the past year, I've seen people driven from their homes, stripped of their careers, and bludgeoned in public for daring to have the wrong opinions. Maybe I'm just having a bad week, but my sympathy for them is a little thin. </div>
