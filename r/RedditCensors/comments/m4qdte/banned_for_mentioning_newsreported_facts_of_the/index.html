    <div class="md">That's the reason she didn't get much coverage when her shooting actually happened, only after Saint Floyd had his overdose did they pull her out as new ammunition. 

Now that St Floyd's family got their 27million, of course St Breonna's boyfriend wants his share of tax payer money also. No room for wrong think when there's gibs on the line.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;  Breona was found to have nothing to do with the body in the trunk. 

Nothing except that the car was rented in her name and she didn't disassociate herself from her friends who put bodies in car trunks. Funny "nothing to do with" you're pushing there. She was a money holder and involved in the drug trade up to her eyeballs. She was a gangster and got what's coming to gangsters.</div>

    <div class="md">The police weren't ready with a case against her that would stick. They came back once the evidence was much clearer that she was actively involved.

You really think that if you rent someone a car to commit murder and hide the body, that the law is just going to let you be? They didn't arrest her because supposedly she had no involvement with her ex-boyfriend. But then that turned out to be completely false.</div>

    <div class="md">Instead of digging up his post history how about you focus on the facts of the Taylor case: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6_QM8h_u5E&amp;t=5s

And remember, the boyfriend gave conflicting accounts of what happened.

In some interviews he said Breonna shot first. https://www.the-sun.com/news/1572441/breonna-taylors-bf-told-cops-she-shot-at-them-first/

In other interviews he said he shot first. https://youtu.be/_6_QM8h_u5E?t=897

In either case, someone shot at the police. The police RETURNED fire. Moral of the story, don't do criminal shit then shoot at the police.

I'm almost certain you don't even known about what really went down. You just know what headlines have told you.

*****

That being said, and this if fucking important... I believe no-knock warrants are garbage and should be done away with. If you can't catch someone without surprise raiding their home and risking everyone's lives, too bad.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; whether he was high as fuck or not is entirely irrelevant.

Not according to the autopsy that said he was so loaded on uppers &amp; downers, plus his serious heart condition &amp; covid, that it was no surprise that he croaked. Note also that the autopsy states there was no damage to the throat. Note also that in the full video he's saying that he cant breath before anyone even has him on the ground. He was dying of an OD and still, STILL lied to the cops that he was on drugs. They would have helped him and all this would have been avoided if he hadn't've been such a deadbeat, junky, career criminal liar. 

Note also the video found of a previous encounter where the cops approach and he swallows his drugs. Most likely the same stunt he pulled during the arrest where he OD'd. 

Fuck his family getting $27million for his worthless hide.</div>

    <div class="md">Look. There's video. Whether he was high or not, the cops actions led to his immediate death and he did nothing worthy of that. Lying to cops doesn't mean they get to kill you. 

Pick another of the dozen cases where someone is entirely at fault for being justifiably killed by police. Not this one. This isn't the case to go in on.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Lying to cops doesn't mean they get to kill you.

They didn't kill him, his skinful of drugs caused his heart to stop. Also, even if they shot him dead, it wasn't the lying, it wasn't the passing fake money, it wasn't his attempt to drive a car while absolutely shitfaced, it wasn't even his awful porn video where he couldn't get a hard on, it was his resisting arrest that led to the police needing to escalate force. Nothing more. He did it to himself.</div>

    <div class="md">For one, the autopsy clearly reports cause of death as homicide. The amounts of metabolites present that did confirm opiate use were low to the point of active intoxication (which could cause the respiratory depression or in the case of fent the “hardening” of respiratory pathways) being impossible. The way you frame the body in the trunk thing completely ignores what the police report at the time covers. I don’t have to waste time on sources for you because this neat thing called google exists, and these have all been reported on extensively. Just because you pull all your intel from Facebook doesn’t mean I have to treat you with the same regard as someone bringing actual facts to the table. Your entire profile history is an agendapost, maybe you should get a life?</div>

HARDLY "the autopsy clearly reports cause of death as homicide." 

You've got nothing.

You’re obviously delusional and it’s kind of hilarious. You can contact the office to verify the document.

    <div class="md">Ok, so ignoring the host site and the fact that I've never seen any news site anywhere (left or right) link to this document ever (and I've been following this stuff since the beginning), you realise there is a difference between authors of a n autopsy and a press release? The autopsy is composed by the actual medical prefessionals examining the body post-mortum. A press release is written by some flunky in the media office putting whatever spin they like on it. Here she is: 

&gt;Please direct any media inquiries to C. M. Hennepin County
Communications at c.m@hennepin.us. (personal details redacted)

A nice touch is that the name in the press release doesn't match the name in the autopsy report.  

&gt;Manner of death: Homicide

&gt;How injury occurred: Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s)

&gt;Other significant conditions: Arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; recent methamphetamine use 

Oh, so it was murder where he had a heart attack with heart disease and was loaded on fentanyl and meth. """Murder""". 

Gosh you people. Anyway, how's the sneaker shop raids going? Got any fresh kicks?</div>

    <div class="md">You’re such a dumbshit that’s the media contact for the press release you could find that out in two seconds. Homicide means the death was directly caused by another human being, he would still be alive if not for chauvins actions. They make press releases because people like you don’t know what big words mean, and see mention of say, heart disease (wildly common in American men) and instantly think that makes your case. The amounts of drug metabolites (what they use to determine intoxication and amounts/use patterns) do not represent someone “Loaded”.  See normally it’s okay not to know these things if you aren’t a medical professional of some kind, so the county coroners office prepare a statement with a publicist to condense the information. Pretty common practice. And for your information I wear Timberlands, they’re great for kicking in the doors of reactionaries. So if Someone choked out your grandmother, it wouldn’t be murder because she died of other conditions, right? And literally off the top of my head I’ve linked to it independently from a local news site and npr, and I’m sure if you actually tried or followed your news somewhere other than Brietbart or TruePatriotNewsFacts.geocities.net you’d have seen it by now.</div>

    <div class="md">So....why does he need to write the report twice then? So you get a source that elaborates on how you’re too dumb to understand an autopsy report and breaks down both documents and you act like you’re smart? You’re fuckin hilarious thanks for making for some great screen caps. He wrote the report, you’re too dumb to understand how it confirms Floyd died of homicide (literally translated says his heart stopped due to the hold), you get clearly presented info that you’re wrong, now you’re gonna go jack off to your wife’s onlyfans.</div>

    <div class="md">I think you guys are both kind of missing the point here.

The autopsy report itself does not list a specific one of the six allowed manners of death, and thus does not say, "homicide." The autopsy report describes the death as resulting from (and I'm dutifully paraphrasing here): becoming unresponsive during police restraint because 1) he was in an altercation that caused abrasions and bruising, 2) he had Covid, severe heart disease, hypertension, and was on fentanyl and methamphetamine, and 3) no life threatening injuries occurred. There are other numbers after this, but these are in order for a reason, and they get less relevant after the first three.

The memo to the press from the medical examiner is standard, not fake, and it does list the manner of death as homicide. There are some important things to note about this: 1) it is like criminal law 101 that this does not imply anyone is guilty of anything. Seriously, anyone suggesting "homicide" as a manner of death means he was murdered doesn't know the basics of what they're trying to talk about. 2) it is homicide for a number of reasons, including a) the #1 above. Ultimately had he not gotten in a fight with police he probably wouldn't have died. b) anyone who dies during police restraint is always listed as homicide, and part of the reason is, shit you not, because otherwise the media and the public will claim it's a cover-up and the medical examiner doesn't have time to deal with that crap. Incidentally, in this case they claimed it was a cover-up anyway.

https://forensicresources.org/2019/homicide-manner-of-death-vs-legal-conclusion/

&gt;16\. Deaths due to positional restraint induced by law enforcement personnel or to choke holds or other measures to subdue may be classified as Homicide. In such cases, there may not be intent to kill, but the death results from one or more intentional, volitional, potentially harmful acts directed at the decedent (without consent, of course). Further, there is some value to the homicide classification toward reducing the public perception that a ‘cover up’ is being perpetrated by the death investigation agency. (…)

And c) the classification of homicide doesn't mean anything with respect to a criminal trial unless and until the examiner testifies in court as to exactly why they classified it as homicide instead of suicide, accident, or undetermined. Until then, the assumption is simply that the fact that he died while being held down against his will makes it homicide.

However, considering that the #2 in the report was severe heart disease, Covid, other morbid conditions, and multiple deadly drugs, and #3 was no life threatening injuries, we can speculate that "homicide" here was likely a term of convenience and that no one's getting successfully prosecuted for much of anything. Also since it was a legal restraint maneuver taught in police academy and paramedics were called from the very beginning. The fact that people keep referring to this as murder is just ridiculous. Even saying that he died from a knee to the neck is in direct contradiction to the autopsy. He died from fighting with and being restrained by police, because his body couldn't handle that while on multiple dangerous drugs and having Covid, severe heart disease, and hypertension.

EDIT: Any conviction here will be an injustice performed out of fear of backlash from violent criminal mobs. But it very well might happen.</div>

    <div class="md">I’m not saying he’s guilty because of the report. I’m saying he’s guilty because there’s video evidence that for over 8 minutes officers used a banned restraint technique (known to cause positional asphyxia)  on a man who was obviously no longer a threat to them while being made aware by bystanders and the victim that there appeared to be significant risk of death or serious harm to George Floyd. They can not claim that they were unaware that what they were doing could result in death. Murder 1? Fuck no, unless the claims of interactions between chauvin and Floyd at a previous workplace could be better substantiated. But absolutely this is a homicide in both the medical sense and the legal sense.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah I guess there are possibilities here that could get detailed in the trial. That fact that people are telling them he's unresponsive, and they don't bother to fuck off of him... that could amount to something. But I don't think it's a lot. The media are referring to it as "the murder of George Floyd" which is interesting.</div>

    <div class="md">Nice to see /r/news hasn't changed. I got banned back in 2014 for citing that Michael Brown had just robbed a convenience store prior to the officer approaching him for walking in the middle of the road. My evidence was inconvenient to the police brutality narrative the mods were pushing and I have been banned ever since.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah. My ban was permanent. For stating facts reported by reputable local news, in r/news. No reason, no warning, no temp, no response to my questions. I wasn't expecting them to be an unbiased defender of truth, but I didn't realize how brazen they had gotten about utter disregard for facts and balanced discussion.</div>

    <div class="md">It's pretty well known that r/news mods will permanently ban users for stating facts or opinions that trigger the mods. Half the time they don't even give a reason for the ban, they repeatedly violate the moderator guidelines but the admins couldn't care less cuz they're pushing the right narrative.</div>
