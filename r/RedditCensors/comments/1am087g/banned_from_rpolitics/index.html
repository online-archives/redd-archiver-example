    <div class="md">Western Europe doesn’t lean left, they are firmly left as is China, India and Oceania. Considering that encompasses over 2/3rds of the global population I think most would probably agree. I’m not sure what part of the American center you think is further left than average but I’m going to guess that you are focusing on a few select issues that you don’t agree with and assuming everyone but the crazy American liberals agrees with you. Most countries are extremely socially liberal and the ones that aren’t are known to be ruled by violent and oppressive regimes.</div>

    <div class="md">You’re either incredibly naïve, or missing the textured portion of the pink part, go to the sub now and sort it by any criteria you’d like. 

Yea,  it’s very common that after some time controversial posts will be flared users only. That’s because people like you seem to love brigading that sub with nonsense and calling everyone a Nazi, which you’ve already proven in here as well.

Go post things other than repeating NPC nonsense and maybe you will be reciprocated with a more welcoming experience. 

Or go screech some more. I honestly couldn’t care  less, but don’t respond to my comments whining about a reality that exists only in your head.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm center or moderate, as such I find things I like and things I dislike on both sides. Unfortunately in my experience the most hateful people here are leftists. As soon as they find out someone has a right- flavored comment they swarm and down vote, insulting as much as they can. They automatically assume anyone who isn't far left or a socialist is a MAGAT that they need to "put in their place." Hence the reason why I clicked on this post in the first place. This kind of attitude on both sides is the exact reason American society and politics is where it's at right now, unreasonable automatic hatred for anything someone from another viewpoint says or does.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude, I'm a capital C communist. I have a hammer and sickle tattooed on my arm, and I'm an active organizer in the streets.

I was also the best man in my libertarian friend's wedding last year. 

The truth is that leftists and conservatives alike are toxic as hell online. But most leftists have friends who aren't lockstep with our beliefs. And in my case, my best friend is on the opposite end of the spectrum from my beliefs.

Just touch grass, man. Stop assuming the shit you see online represents the actual movement of people who are in the streets.</div>

    <div class="md">The nazis have socialist in their name.  One of their first actions was to murder every socialist in Germany.

What is the full name of North Korea?

Like… let’s use our whole brains, ok?

Also, why does conserve mean “conserving the original purpose America was founded”, and not conserving the immigrant status that all our founding fathers held?

Word games are for stupid people.</div>

    <div class="md">The Nazis were lead by a mentally ill drug addict with a funny moustache. North Korea is a dictatorship, their name means nothing, they have illusion of choice. America was founded on immigrants. Most of our parents, grandparents, great grandparents, and great great grandparents, are immigrants from other countries. They came here because of written rules like the Constitution. To this very day, we welcome immigrants with welcome arms. Just not illegal secretive border hoppers because that can put our own communities at risk of foreign threats.</div>

    <div class="md">That is untrue, currently the government is in control of by Democrats, even in the Congress. There is hardly any Conservative Republicans in any of the seats. 

Responding to your previous comments, if you think Trump or Obama was bad, maybe y'all should look up how Biden upgraded those "kids in cages" to "kids in internment camps" along the border.

I don't really enjoy picking a side, but the shit the democrats do are borderline fascistic.</div>

    <div class="md">The south during the civil war were the conservatives, and they're still conservatives today. The conservatives were in the Democratic party at the time.

The Republicans who freed the slaves, Lincoln, and that black senator were the liberals.

The party name is irrelevant. The ideologies of the people in the parties is what matters.</div>

    <div class="md">Right. That was when the Republican Party was the center of U.S. politics. 

In that same period when the Democratic Party was composed of conservative, white, rural, Southern, racist, Christian fundamentalists. Today that Demographic votes firmly Republican, because the Republican Party is the current Conservative Party. 

This is also why Republicans are the ones flying Confederate flags and whining about those loser confederate monuments being toppled.

It’s a shame that you cowards can’t even own your history. But it really shows everyone exactly how wretched you people are, that you have to deny your own ancestors. Just absolutely pathetic stuff.</div>

For one, looking at politics of the past today, the Soviet Union could literally have been argued to turn conservative by the mid-80s and early 90s when theh fell. Conservatives exist in every government and in any system dude because "conserving" IS in the name.

You do realize that even if Lincoln -- a Republican -- freed the slaves that doesn't make him a liberal LOL -- he still considered slaves to be inferior to the white man and that's why he didn't take it a step further and gave them rights nor did he want race mixing.

>This is also why Republicans are the ones flying Confederate flags and whining about those loser confederate monuments being toppled.

So you support history being erased? Lets say in worst case scenario a nuclear war happens or somehow all the history books are burned. How else do you expect people to learn of the country's past if everything relating to that history is toppled? Makes literally no sense and this is why society is becoming even more ignorant each and every day. Thank you.

>It’s a shame that you cowards can’t even own your history. But it really shows everyone exactly how wretched you people are, that you have to deny your own ancestors. Just absolutely pathetic stuff.

It isn't just *my* history though dude, you literally were born in the U.S. so as a nation we collectively and inherently share that history. Also, what cowards? Im here owning up and admitting to you right now that my ancestors used to own slaves and I don't condone it at all. If you wanna call me a racist or fascist for my ancestors, you are putting their mistakes onto me and that's generally unacceptable. I do deny my own ancestors, I reject them even but apparently even when I do the right thing im apparently "wretched" to people like you.

I want the statues and monuments up so that people can be reminded of our horrible past and if you want to be the one to topple them then you are the one who can't handle our nation's dark history.</div>

    <div class="md">Do you know what a liberal is?  Modern liberalism wasn't around during the Civil war because it didn't exist yet.  

Conservatives are the OG liberals.   US conservatism was founded on classical liberalism.   It was this liberalism  that Lincoln appealed to in order to sway conservatives to fight to maintain the union.   

The South wasn't liberal nor conservative.   It was confederate.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree that liberals are not the same as leftists. But it’s insane to say that the confederates were not a conservative movement. They were textbook examples of a movement that was formed to conserve a traditional power structure. It’s literally the definition. 

And it’s just pathetic when modern conservatives try to deflect this reality because they don’t want to admit that their political philosophy is tied almost exclusively to morally reprehensible beliefs. Conservatives were pro-slavery, against women’s suffrage, against racial integration, against marriage equality, etc. 

These cowards need to be called out and held to account.</div>

Congratulations.   You convinced me that you just don't know history,.  And as a bonus,  you threw in solid proof that you don't know what conservatism is.


You're not a troll.   You're just a victim of public education and propaganda.   

[.Here is Lincoln speech talking directly to conservatives.](https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/summary.htm)

Here is the specific line to help you understand why conservatives rejected the south's plan to separate. "You say you are conservative. We are the conservatives. We want to maintain things as they were. You advocate new and untried ideas."

If you want to know more about why the conservatives formed a brand new party and eventually went to war to end slavery,  I suggest you start reading actual  history books and listen to a history teacher.

You should also read up on classical liberalism,  conservatism, and liberalism.   Because that textbook you keep mentioning doesn't exist.  The real textbooks say something completely different. 

Good luck, my confused friend.</div>

    <div class="md">And here’s the definition of conservative you ignorant chimp:

“Conservatism is a cultural, social, and political philosophy that seeks to promote and to preserve traditional institutions, customs, and values.[1][2][3] The central tenets of conservatism may vary in relation to the culture and civilization in which it appears.[4] In Western culture, depending on the particular nation, conservatives seek to promote a range of institutions, such as the nuclear family, organized religion, the military, the nation-state, property rights, rule of law, aristocracy, and monarchy.[5] Conservatives tend to favour institutions and practices that guarantee social order and historical continuity.[6]”

Congratulations, you’re both pathetic and stupid. Like a typical conservative you don’t want to acknowledge that your worldviews are heinous and have always been on the wrong side of history. 

You, conservative, are the side that wanted to preserve slavery. You, conservative, were opposed to women’s suffrage. You, conservative, were opposed to integration . You were opposed to interracial marriage, same sex marriage, and a host of other progressive causes that brushed up against your “traditional” beliefs.

Conservatives, like yourself, are cowards and frauds. That’s why you lose. 

Bye bye, coward .</div>

    <div class="md">I called it an article of cope because that is what it was.  Unless Abe just calls everybody a dear friend.

Looking at how you seem to go with it like a clown</div>

    <div class="md">Republicans pass voter ID laws and voting district maps designed to keep black people from voting… they’ve never stopped trying to keep minorities from voting, they just have to do it in roundabout  ways because it’s illegal (GOP majority supreme courts have nullified almost all of the voting rights act).

And the KKK endorses the GOP, and GOP politicians campaign almost exclusively on racial hatred, fear of blacks, Mexicans, and Arabs is 90% of your average trump speech. GOP is the party of the south = the party of the confederacy. 

They venerate monuments to actual traitors that killed US soldiers, fly the flag of treason and try and rewrite history books to teach children it wasn’t about slavery</div>

    <div class="md">There is a lot to unpack here... first off...assuming anyone of a different skin color not being able to get an ID is absolutely racist. 

https://youtu.be/Mp2wiO12O-Y?si=ckK22SMxueWbjiUy

I want everyone that is here, a full citizen, that wants to promote the general welfare to vote.  

GOP campaigns on radial hatred?.... *Stares at you through Clarence Thomas's glasses.... or Thomas Sowell, take your pick, they are both amazing men. 

Identity politics is a game that only fuels more hatred and that has been the push ever since Obama was in power. 

That last point... we learn from our history.  You would not have been a trailblazer from what I'm seeing as you advocate with no proof... and that's not even an attack that's just a clear observation.  So everyone in the GOP is racist from what I'm reading? 

The war was about many things, slavery was, of course, a huge part of that. Regardless of skin color, every American Patriot is my brother or sister. The only ones I see pushing hate are those promoting CRT to school kids.</div>

    <div class="md">You do realize the Democrats were literally formed from the Southern "Dixie" crats right? The ones who lead The Confederacy? Its been a hundred years, dude. Shit changes and most of those changes are made only to get easy votes. Are you honestly telling me that the Democrats didn't change from their racist descendants just to play on society's issues by promising free healthcare and education? Politicians are manipulative and will play on society's issues... this is a no-brainer.

The reason why backwoods redneck conservatives fly the confederate battle flag or naval jack is mainly for a sense of pride dude, soldiers died on both sides and each side was preserving or conserving their way of life. The civil war was fought between brothers. If you don't honor the fallen, I wouldn't expect you to show respect to the current armed forces who fight in unjust wars to this day -- who come back home and get attacked by groups like Antifa or BLM or ACAB or any other groups that actively oppose the status quo which the Democrats actively encourage.

If any conservative flies the confederate battle flag for ill-intent, then they are probably the kind of backwoods redneck that don't even trust or like the government so to label them as Republican supporters is just kinda ignorant and stupid. Do you really think that all self-described "Republican" supporters actually trust the government? I think you're confusing them all with the democrats who like to milk the government for welfare. It's just really ignorant to say all conservatives secretly fly a confederate battle flag when noone is looking. I'd honestly much rather stare at a battle flag than a fucking rainbow flag -- ill tell you that right now -- and if I wanted to look at a rainbow then I'd wait for the fucking rain.</div>

    <div class="md">No they didn't. Technically the Democratic party did, but back then the Democratic party was the conservative party, not the liberal one they are today.

But you probably knew that already, didn't you? You just don't care because all you want is something you can use to attack the people you disagree with, regardless of whether there's any actual truth to it.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, if you agree that abortion should be legally protected and that gay marriage is A-Ok, you are not an American conservative. Because American conservatives are actively fighting both of those things, as shown by the conservative majority SC overturning Roe and conservative Republican congress members calling for a “reevaluation of same-sex marriage”. You literally proved my point bud.</div>

    <div class="md">That's a small minded view. Not everybody thinks exactly same. We're not robots. However some people act like robots. I approve of the dismissal of roe v wade because access to abortion is heavily abused, only about 5% of abortions are justified by medical or moral reasons. Overturning roe v wade doesn't ban abortion, it simply gives states the ability to make their own laws and stops the federal government from interfering with the politics of the State. Some congress members thinking about "reevaluation" means nothing. And if they DO do away with gay marriage, so what. Why do you need to get the government involved in your love life anyways? Have a wedding, have a ceremony, you just won't be legally bound. If you love each other, why do you need approval from daddy government?</div>

    <div class="md">Roe made it illegal to federally ban abortions and states could write their own laws with what they would allow within their framework. What you’re saying the repeal of Roe does is ACTUALLY what the system beforehand did. It barred any states from flatly banning abortion while allowing them to pass restrictions on what was legally allowed in the state. You either had zero clue how Roe and abortion was handled before the overturn or you’re arguing incredibly disingenuously.</div>

    <div class="md">Overturning it leaves power entirely to the states for the public to vote upon. Many conservs aren't pro-gay, but most quite literally do not care. Not for it, nor against it. A neutral stance on the topic is common ground. I feel it should be protected under the 1st amendment. Conservatives get angry when the libs want to involve children in the whole lgbtqiabcd+ thing. That's the biggest controversy.</div>

    <div class="md">Is it not? You said that I wanted to push my agenda and put every one that disagrees with me in a box then I brought up how republicans are called RINOs for not being trumpist as an example of pushing an agenda and putting everyone that disagrees with so and so in a box.

Every political party/ group does that, it’s not exclusive to one party/group. For example a lot of republicans call people who disagree with them leftists, or woke or, what ever popular buzzword that can be used as a negative adjective. Wouldn’t that be a prime example of putting those who disagree with me in a box? Or, is it different?</div>

A liberal is closer to being a centrist, they put money above all but believe they should be the ones in control because they are the "third way" -- would recommend you research third wayists.</div>

    <div class="md">I've seen this game before, and you tend to only read what you want to see vs. what's actually there... you didn't respond to the real issues, and you are asking me now only in this reply if sexual education is grooming.  I know your game boy... you keep asking shit and never answer when asked. (Everyone who doesn't agree with you is some Christian whacko or some crap... how utterly cliché and very 2004)

Are the books that bring sexual fantasies and push all forms of sex to kids in a story format to make it enticing and attempt to cause sexual curiosity and arousal ok to be in a school library (not a non-fiction class session about reproductive anatomy or safe/sex education in a very specific taught environment with parental consent using carefully approved literature)? 

If that question doesn't also answer your question, then you are not anywhere close to being as smart as you think. Please prove me wrong by actually answering the above question intelligently.... I won't hold my breath. 😊 

Bottom line in case you miss it.  5 year olds or hell even older don't need access to books that teach or promote sex or teach about sexuality... let them be kids ffs.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah.... how's that gender affirming care by cutting off the breasts of little girls going for the Left? Real groundbreaking stuff there.  Considering that whole suicide push is only to promote a being that will forever be a slave to big pharma for the hormones among other issues.... let's not even go down the fake penis path.

    <div class="md">Ever heard of gyno before? Tons of men get breast reduction to cure it, and have you ever met a woman that gotten breast reduction to spare themselves for back pain? And you mean Neo-penises right? Something that the majority of trans men can’t afford nor is it widely assessable.

I can tell you have no original thoughts about any issues that this country is going through nor the intelligence to interact with groups different in you. It would be funny if their weren’t hordes of “freethinkers” like you voting and making policies.</div>

Unless these hypothetical little girls all have breast cancer from some odd reason no reputable plastic surgeon is going to doing anything to a kid.

    <div class="md">You can see this shit everywhere in "conservative" spaces. They downplay their insane bullshit with stuff like "this grandma walked in the capitol on January 6th and now she's facing thirty years in prison!!!" then you look up the case and she smashed a cop in the face with a fucking ice pick.

And you DEFINITELY see it all over reddit where people whine about catching a ban somewhere, they say something like "I was banned for going against the leftist narrative!!!" then you check out their comment history and it's some unhinged white nationalist bullshit about drowning immigrants in razor wire</div>

    <div class="md">They don't believe it, they just want to win so they keep pushing the narrative. Politics became a team sport back in 2012. I voted for Obama first term 2008 and fell for his charisma and lies... that was the deeper inlay of the country's political division due to false hate claims based on identity politics.  All the attention grabbing became a lust for power and still remains to this day.</div>

    <div class="md">So, again.. give me *examples*. I hear people say this all the time but it makes no sense lol. The American Democratic Party would be considered “on the right” in Africa? In Latin America? In the Middle East? 

Does “the rest of the world” mean Western Europe to you? Or else you need to explain what policies make the American Democratic Party “on the right”. And what policies do “real left wing” political parties have?</div>

    <div class="md">Lol no I have googled it… and basically everything listed as being “leftism” or left wing aligns almost perfectly with the American Democratic Party - from economics (welfare state) to environmentalism, to social progressivism, to secularism… the Democratic Party, mostly, supports healthcare reform.

It’s definitely the truth that the American Democratic Party is *very left wing* in much of the world. You could even say that the American Republican Party is left of center for a good portion of the world lol. 

People definitely bring out the “the American Democratic Party is right of center in the rest of the world” quote to try to make it seem as though, we’ll jeez if *they’re* right of center, then the republicans must be *ultra mega right of center*</div>

    <div class="md">Ok, but that’s like *maybe half the world*? It’s not a straw man when I gave him literally half the globe, if not more. 

Several southeast Asian countries have the death penalty for drug dealers? Would that be a left wing policy?</div>

    <div class="md">But that was point to begin with… it’s not “the rest of the world” if you don’t count any of the countries that don’t fit your argument. That’s using exaggeration to support your position. That’s like me saying “the Republican Party is left wing in the rest of the world… but not counting Western Europe… or Australia… or New Zealand… or parts of Asia… or parts of Latin America. If you just discount half the world, then it isn’t “the rest of the world” lol</div>

    <div class="md">The problem is one group (moderates) will age out much sooner than later, and the future (extreme leftists) will likely replace them.  

I’m not interested in pursuing the direction of the green new deal, or other leftist policies proposed by AOC or her “SQUAD”. 

I have nothing against improving health insurance or free college education in the US, so I’m not exactly “right” either, but I would prefer not to be taxed any more than we already are, for benefits we don’t actually get.</div>

Outspoken liberal media personalities like Michael Eric Dyson were literally made infamous by calling Trump supporters “Maggots”

Feel free to google how many left leaning politicians refer to Trump supporters as Nazis, Maggots, and the like.</div>

    <div class="md">Looking at your comment history on the post you mention and I can see why lol. Instead of having a political conversation you default to attacking the sub for being the same people, it breaks the sub rules albeit you barely break the rules. Calling a discussion that instantly defaults to attacks a political one is crazy imo</div>

    <div class="md">Well considering that a majority of Redditors are either bots or foreign intelligence trolls trying to sow dissent, it’s not surprising that certain subs would require that.  And as someone else pointed out, it’s a Conservative sub…. It’s not masquerading as neutral ground.  Basically every sub that isn’t specifically right wing outright is populated and moderated by Marxists.</div>

    <div class="md">I got banned from a sub I wasn't subbed to or ever used, that I had seen was a ban-spree for *being in another sub* they didn't like... hindsight, shouldn't have responded at all, but replied "yall are abusing your banning and it ought to be reported"

Week later I got a warning to ban my entire account by actual reddit mods for my reply, stating I was "threatening their life" lol. 

Gross negligence of "power", and overall weak af.</div>

    <div class="md">Yep. It was the JP sub that I'm in that got me banned, which is annoying because it removes all nuance. I like. JP for his early work about life, psychology, 12 steps, etc.. I don't care for the Twitter stuff.

But yeah, Reddit being Reddit to assume first ~~ask questions later~~ never ask questions, just attack. Ironic given what they say about the right, as they lean people towards the right more than any of their "slippery slopes" people they hate will ever do.</div>

    <div class="md">I highly doubt it, unless your dispute involved an infraction against reddit terms of use (threats of violence or some such).  I’ve been banned from multiple subs and, although I never waste time arguing with mods, I have no doubt my original comment infuriated them enough to delete my account if that were possible.  If I may be so bold as to make a suggestion:  don’t argue bans with mods.  They are not going to change their mind, and I suspect they enjoy the interaction because they are in a position of power and all you can do is vent at them.  I only ever either ignore the ban, or message back “I’ll wear this ban as a badge of pride” and move on.</div>

    <div class="md">On the contrary, I’ve recently had a sub ban reversed because I pointed out that I quoted something someone else said to me, as opposed to me being the one that said it (and getting reported).

The mods were still aholes about it by implying that I “baited” them, but if a person says something stupid to you, you shouldn’t be at fault for it. You never pushed the reply button for them. Everyone has free will.</div>

No wonder the world is going to hell in a hand basket, supposedly mature critical thinking adults are having "discussions" at the grade school level.

    <div class="md">Oh I guess when people get banned for bs, you suggest that they act better; you must be a mod or related to one or, hopefully not inebriated.  Can't you empathize with the frustrated adults tired of this childish mod behavior instead of attacking the frustration of the victims coming here to debate and learn and telling them to deal with it and just take the high road.  If I was a betting person, I'd bet you are a pathetic lefty.  Becareful you just might get kicked out of the basement yourself and will have to work for a living.

    <div class="md">This country is so divided anymore, the ignorance shows, people have no idea how to debate with integrity, how to agree to disagree. Anymore it is all about shutting the other person down and trying to silence them instead of engaging the person in a logical debate. 

So sad that it has come to this and that no one remembers how to meet in the middle and realize that maybe I don't agree with the other person entirely but maybe they have a few valid points that make you think... Instead, you either agree with me or you are my enemy..</div>

    <div class="md">>This country isn't near as divided as the media and platforms like these want you to believe. Reddit can be better.

HERE HERE!! 

There's so much rhetoric going around that you can't trust the other side, you can't even talk to the other side, they *ALL* believe X,Y,Z (horrible things) and you shouldn't even bother.

Any instance where I've been able to break through that, or find someone simply willing to to hear you out, it always turns out that we have a lot more in common on even hot button issues than we're led to believe. People are primed to be distrustful of the other party, it's stupid and it sucks, we can do better.</div>

    <div class="md">The agenda being pushed is extremism on both sides, there is no more middle ground. There are people out there who know that political topics are gray and not black and white but it’s a black and white agenda that is being pushed. The left portrays the right as a bunch of old racist people with MAGA hats and the right portrays the left as a bunch of purple haired non binary they/thems but we all know that those people on both sides make up a small minority. I find myself in the middle but I get weird looks when I tell people that. Both sides call each other sensitive but in reality they both are sensitive.</div>

    <div class="md">>Reddit can be better.

Reddit cannot be better.  

It's a bunch of Dunning-Kruger afflicted neckbearded know-it-alls who use their first world privilege (yes I'm appropriating their word) to live in a fairytale where they are the hero.  Unburdened by the need to generate an income to payback their massive debts, the mighty keyboard warriors block people who hurt their feelings and message equally disdainful mods to ban wrong speak.  

The only breaks?  To chug corn syrup filled soda and do virtual appointments with doctors so both their social anxiety can be pandered to and their pancreas can keep from exploding.  They save water by not bathing, that's how committed they are to climate change.

Don't simp Reddit or that sub dude.  Congrats on the ban.</div>

    <div class="md">It's not a tool though, that's my point.  It's no more a tool with a broad reach than a circlejerk is community outreach.  Social media isn't a public service, it's private business.  I suppose saying simping might not have been the right word, but see it for what it is versus what it could be.  It could be more than it is, but it's stuck being what it is due to the people it attracts.</div>

    <div class="md">This isn’t a political discussion. This is a discussion about you getting banned. You asked me if I agreed that Trump is a danger to democracy, he is. He’s already stated he doesn’t like the constitution and he tried to overthrow the government when he lost. You very obviously worship Trump, it’s not even a question that you do, every time someone points out his faults you absolutely lose your shit. I have never in all my years lost my shit defending a president I voted for because I don’t worship them like you do. You have serious mental health issues to be this obsessed with a man you don’t know and who doesn’t care one bit about you. You come off like an abused woman defending her abuser, it’s really weird.</div>

    <div class="md">"This isn’t a political discussion. This is a discussion about you getting banned.", the only fair statement you have made. If someone is left with two options and dislike the other enough to shift their vote, that is not indictive of any love or desire, it is a two party system, not more you can do. Asking for clarification does that indicate worship, yet I am not even sure you understand the words that i am using. Your approach is not healthy, and I imagine it impacts your relationships and decision making process. I am not sure you can decipher between reality and media guise. You are incoherent and imagine that this infests your personal life as well.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean, if you're going to insult people, it's kind of stupid to pretend that it is a conservative position that got you banned. 

It's like when a bunch of rwnjs took to social media and started posting violent shit and hate speech and then cried their bans were political. Being an asshole or being violent aren't political ideologies. The people that can't figure it out are the reason many people are suspicious of people claiming broad, rightwing political ideologies. It's just a very bad mask to disguise a faulty moral compass.</div>

    <div class="md">> I find it very sad that the sub meant for all Americans to discuss politics

Why would you think that?  That sub - as with all the large subs here - are meant for one express purpose: for the left to set/control the public narrative.  They ban dissent in an attempt to: 1. Give the view that that everyone has arrived at this (false) public consensus on everything. 2. Make an example of everyone that doesn't comply, so that others will fall into line.</div>

    <div class="md">It is a shame that one sub leans a certain way, providing carte blanche that side when having a conversation. I like reddit to have my views challenged and changed, but when you enter in a topic where only one side is protected can be deflating. The banning from the hip approach is not a good thing.

    <div class="md">Diversity of opinion and thought only matter to r/politics if matches the accepted prog left narrative on there.  Get out of line and they arent interested in diversity or inclusion of alternative worldviews at all.   

The sooner you accept this, the easier it becomes to breathe easy, shrug you shoulders, and realize there's nothing to be done for them.  They have to have a rock-bottom moment before they come out of it.</div>

You're postion hurts people (whether you know or care or believe us, is immaterial).

Just because you refuse or are unable to recognize 2nd and 3rd order repercussions that occur due to your postion and policies, changes nothing.

Until you can be a good citizen,  we don't want to associate with you.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s definitely a new thing since the great mod purge following the api closures. A lot of mods walked away and new yes men took their place. Obviously this is all in service of sanitizing the place in advance of the reddit ipo going live soon. I was have been subbed there for the whatever twelve or something plus years I have had that account and have had pretty much the same opinions and reddit demeanor the whole time and I have been banned three times from that sub since the api thing for saying: 

1. Nazis should be punched 
2. Quoting someone, in quotes that included the term “libt**d” which was to point out its a shitty word but just mentioning it caught a ban
3. Participating in other subs unrelated to that one.

Its gone totally off the rails with its tone policing and aocially reactive speech policing that is very much out of line with what is legally protected speech. Now, reddit doesnt have to platform any speech it doesn’t want to, but at least be honest about it rather than making ip fake claims about what is and isn’t protected speech.

Anyways, this comes from someone who considered themselves “far left” before “Windows” was an available product.

I appealed all my bans and they were removed. But yeah there is a lot of over aggressive and unjustified mod actions all across reddit which is because they gave the slots to patsies after the purge while gearing up for their IPO. Shocker folks. Capital values more capital above absolutely anything else.</div>

I'm referring to whatever the other user in r/conservative assumed about who you are, based on your username. I'm speculating that your response to that may have played a larger role in your banning than the Trump daddy remark.</div>

    <div class="md">I saw that wasn't the first time you had spoken negatively about Trump on there. Given some of the other replies you were getting about your comments in other subs, it just seemed like their issue was more about who you are than it was about Trump. Admittedly you have engaged with that community more than I have though.</div>

    <div class="md">Just move to Twitter / X instead. You won't get censored anymore, and as Reddit doubles down on censorship, their echo chamber will eventually devour itself.

Pro tip: Think of 2 or 3 speakers, celebrities, politicians, etc that you respect, go to their profile and follow them. Then click on "Following" on their profile, and follow a bunch of people they follow. The more people you follow, the more interesting your feed gets.

Extra benefit: Every now and then you might just get a response from someone famous!</div>

    <div class="md">Except they do, it's called gender disphoria. Leave the science to rational people. Instead of emotional, biased sources.

Telling someone with gender disphoria that they can become something their not is no different than telling a schizophrenic to believe the voices in their head.

Just because you feel a certain way, doesn't mean it's true.

Whoever tried to tell you that it isn't a mental disorder is lying to you.</div>

    <div class="md">The NHS also holds the perspective that gender and sex are in no way linked, which is false entirely, the NHS must maintain this view for their reasoning to hold the slightest bit of water, but I won't stop there, 

Secondarily, depression is a mental illness which is characterized by how the individual feels based on certain situations and stimuli,  or rather. "Is a constant feeling of sadness and loss of interest, which stops you doing your normal activities.

Meanwhile, gender dysphoria is characterized by the UK NHS as "Gender dysphoria is a term that describes a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity"

Unease is synonymous with anxiety or fear, so tell me.

How is it that depression, which is a chronic case of negative emotions affecting you day to day life, is a mental disorder, but gender dysphoria, which is a chronic case of negative emotions affecting your day to day life, isn't a mental disorder?

Not exactly the same, but I think anxiety and depression go hand in hand in the medical field.</div>

    <div class="md">[With the publication of DSM–5 in 2013, “gender identity disorder” was eliminated and replaced with “gender dysphoria.” This change further focused the diagnosis on the gender identity-related distress that some transgender people experience (and for which they may seek psychiatric, medical, and surgical treatments) rather than on transgender individuals or identities themselves.](https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/diversity/education/transgender-and-gender-nonconforming-patients/gender-dysphoria-diagnosis#:~:text=With%20the%20publication%20of%20DSM%E2%80%935%20in%202013%2C%20%E2%80%9Cgender,%2C%20medical%2C%20and%20surgical%20treatments)) More than answers your "question". I'd be happy to address the rest of your bad faith rubbish, but since you haven't provided a single credible source for any of your assertions... It doesn't seem like there's much to address.

The science hasn't been on your side for well over a decade now.</div>
