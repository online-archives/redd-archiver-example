    <div class="md">I like how stuff like that is an area where people can orderly express opinions on number of sexes and meanings of the word gender without backlash, but its banned. The only reason I could see (based on my own personal experiences so, y'know grain of salt and all) for it being banned is that places like that, which offer a fresh opinion, are also filled with hateful bigots who like to discriminate against  "transgender" people under the guise of being scientific in their ways when they don't know what they're spewing anymore than most gender studies people. 


I think that I'm only confirmed more in this by the fact there are some of those people in these comments. Who knows maybe I'm too sensitive, but effortless comments like "hurr durr you're mentally disabled retard" (exaggeration) that dont contribute anything to the discussion only serve to drive to people farther into their beliefs. You're never going to get someone to agree with you if you insult them.</div>

look up the back story on john money and david reimer.  john money is the piece of shit who experimented on a baby.  david reimer was changed from a boy to a girl as a baby via surgery, and then started to reverse the transition to male when he went into puberty... dickless and now with a surgically manufactured gaping wound.  he suffered severe depression and eventually committed suicide directly because of the irreparable damage and horror he experienced.  then his brother committed.  then his parents.

the project was such a failure that john hopkins university banned further experimentation or study in the field for decades.  when gays got equality, the LGBT movement was hijacked by deranged psychopaths to reignite money's long debunked cult belief that gender is a choice or can be changed.</div>

    <div class="md">I appreciate that you assumed I was arguing in good faith and responded accordingly. 

In short, my view is that sex is the biological reality and that gender are the social constructs built around the physical and practical realities of sex and sexual characteristics. I don’t think that distinction is controversial, and I’ll assume most people here also make that distinction

I also assume you and even most of the people downvoting me would concede that the science has shown that most of the behavioral traits that we associate with one gender or another are only marginally “hard-coded” into individuals. Gendered traits are reliably associated with a particular sex on a population level, but it’s impossible to extricate the origins of those behaviors from social causes on that scale. And even on that scale, the differences in gendered traits are still sleight because there’s so much variance within each sex. I think we’re on the same page that a conversation about expanding the gender identities associated with each sex to better resemble the broad swath of behavior within each sex would improve plenty of lives at little social cost.

Someone else in this thread mentioned that sex is largely bimodal in humans and that’s true. However, the small minority of people who are biologically intersex have a valid claim to being of a different sex regardless of how few they may be. They are not simply “without sex” for not fitting within the modal parts of the distribution. My assertion is that, even if there is not a third “mode”, denying that they are even a category for the sake of simplifying the concept of biological sex to “the sexes” borders on denying that sex is still a distribution.

The fact that people exist outside of the two modes of biological sex is important to consider in conversations about gender. When sex itself has exceptions to it’s two largest categories, gender ought to be thought of as having infinitely more exception considering that it’s attachment to sex is as loose as it is. I don’t think that’s controversial either.

I think what is controversial are some of the extremes that some people take these conclusions to. That sexual categories are so fluid that, say, it’s worth getting rid of sexual categories in sports, where they are obviously relevant. Or that they are so fluid that differences in sexual aggression between the sexes are beyond reasonable consideration. Or that the sexual and gender identities of developing people can be so reliably understood to the degree that there is no risk inherent in permanent medical procedures based on that understanding

I think what is also controversial are the extremes that ignoring these conclusions would take a person to. That anyone with sufficient difference in their sexual traits is such an aberration that their existence shouldn’t even be considered when making public policy. That only a person’s genitals should be considered in assessing their sexual traits, even if they have hormone levels, brain chemistry, and behavior that resembles the other sexual mode. And that anyone with different preferences in their gender expression must necessarily be treated as morally deficient - under the guise of referring to them as mentally ill

Anyway, obviously there are ideologues and outright frauds on both sides of this issue. Remember that such people are generally far more outspoken by virtue of their certainty</div>

    <div class="md">I disagree with some of your elaborations, but I don't want to discuss this any further past this response, as we are likely to simply continue to disagree on the subtleties. I am no expert, but my observation is that sex and gender are extremely closely related and that our current culture is exasperating a non-issue. I don't care what people want to call themselves, how they want to dress or what surgery they want to have performed on themselves. Leave me alone. Leave impressionable children alone.
