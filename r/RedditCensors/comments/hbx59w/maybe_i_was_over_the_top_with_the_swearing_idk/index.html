    <div class="md">🙄 you shouldn't be a mod.

Do we really want to raise a populace so sheltered that they can't even handle being called a name long enough to block someone on their own?

Everybody has the power to click "block" - they don't need you to do it for them.

If someone threatens violence or does something illegal, *then* you can remove their comment and report them.

In some subreddits, modding may also make sure that conversations stay on-topic.

Like if I run a sub about trains and someone comes on to rant about religion or politics, that would be an example of something that could be removed, BUT - you must be very careful to remove *every single instance of this uniformly* - and that never seems to happen. 

Best to play it safe as possible before you silence another human being by force.</div>

    <div class="md">I get where you are coming from, but on my sub some politics or controversial stuff is within the topic of discussion, so I can't remove it, but when people start personally attacking others it leads to more people doing it, and shifts the conversation from talking about a topic to talking about each other, which is a form of off-topic conversation and something I have seen myself on similar subs with more lax moderation

Basically I remove insults not because I don't want one person to be offended, but because insults serve no legitimate purpose and leas the conversation off topic

&gt;you must be very careful to remove *every single instance of this uniformly* \- and that never seems to happen.

This is very important, and unfortunately rare, you are right</div>

    <div class="md">Well I apologize for judging you so harshly but as you can see I'm here a lot for being censored lol.

Usually I try to avoid calling people names, but most recently I alerted someone to their deleted comment - they replied to me calling me a "loon" which was a single word at the end of their otherwise reasonable point.

They took my advice and removed the word and we ended up having a good conversation - one that never would've happened because he called me a name that doesn't bother me at all.

Link: https://old.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/hbp5wx/truth/fvbguwx/

I'm on mobile or I'd link his censored comment - you can ceddit it here:

https://snew.notabug.io/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/hbp5wx/truth/fvbguwx/

It's worth noting that the rest of his comment was him saying he wouldn't vote for Biden - removed because of the word "loon" - see how it gets shady?</div>
