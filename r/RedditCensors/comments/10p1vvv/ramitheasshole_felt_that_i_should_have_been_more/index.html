in which somebody talked about a series of incidents in which her husband deliberately (and fraudulently) sabotaged her son's job search, so he could go on getting free caretaker work out of him for his younger son, I wrote this:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;You were absolutely right, and your husband was absolutely, hideously in the wrong. He was destroying your son's life. The longer the gap in Aiden's work record, the more trouble he is going to have finding work. After a while, a shockingly short time, a job seeker can find himself at a point of no return, denied employment by more and more employers on the basis of his long period of unemployment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not being a psychiatrist, I'm not sure whether your husband sounds more like a narcissist or a sociopath, but either way, I'm worried for you and your boys.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It was swiftly removed. When I wrote in to ask why an obviously on-topic reply was removed, I was given a reply that included these words.

" Rule 1 is written so the intent is clear from the first sentence. "Attack ideas, not people." **Your comment was reported and removed because it is an attack under our rules.** "

Let us use our common sense. There is no way to say how horrible the husband's actions were, without him being cast in a negative light in the process, and the name of the subreddit is r/AmItheAsshole. The fact that, no matter how one replies to a post in the group, one will end up saying something that casts somebody in an at least somewhat negative light is fairly inescapable.

The policy is so broadly written as to serve as an excuse for an abusive mod to remove any reply he wants to. If one looks though the replies to the OP's query, one will find comments that certainly aren't any more favorable to the husband (who is never named) than my own obviously friendly, well intentioned reply, but the mods in that sub have already given themselves an out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;"But I was just telling the truth! They really are a \[insert insult of choice here\]" That's your opinion, not the truth, and it's still attacking a person.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But I see worse!" Please report comments you feel are rule violations. Other rule violations do not excuse your own.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, they don't care whether one was, in fact, being temperate, reasonable and, as the word would commonly be used, actually civil as one replied. Further, they've granted themselves the right to be capricious.

When the mods stick an announcement that they're going to be jerks into the fine print for the rules, as I see they did here, while that certainly provides the prospective member with a good reason to go elsewhere, that act doesn't change the fact that they're acting like jerks.

&amp;#x200B;

r/AmItheAsshole is a good subreddit to avoid.</div>

A while back, I posted about a spat with a co-worker who I manage.  Basically, people at my job said I was wrong to write up a colleague, because writing him up would have gotten him fired.  Apparently *that* was bad, according to HR, because he's an "immigrant" and losing his job means losing his work permit.

I explained that it wasn't as dire as people were making it out to be: He's an expat (meaning he's here by choice), he's originally from a first-world country, and he was consistently late in a front-facing position.  As for myself, I'm also a foreigner in this country so it's not like I'm haughty person picking on a "poor immigrant who's just trying to make an honest living".

Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed over there at AITA, and most people said that given the circumstances, I was just doing what I had to do.

Suddenly, the mods intervened and said that I was breaking a rule against posting work-related content.</div>

What did the complainers expect? That's obviously a problem. If customers show up and the face of the company isn't there, how are they going to react?

Sorry you ran into that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Suddenly, the mods intervened and said that I was breaking a rule against posting work-related content.

&amp;#x200B;

I just checked, and noticed the absence of any such rule. But I'm guessing that there was one right after the intervention? I saw an admin play that game on another site - take action, and then edit the rules after the fact.

I guess the mods there must live for drama. Good to know.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;What did the complainers expect? That's obviously a problem. If customers show up and the face of the company isn't there, how are they going to react?

They claimed I was letting other people be late, but it was a question of degrees.  If someone called me and said that they were stuck in traffic, and that they were going to be 10 minutes late - and if that person was late maybe once a month - I let it slide.  If he's 30 minutes to an hour late, twice a week without calling in, it's a problem.

So yes, superficially, I allowed someone to be late and I let it go, but it was about the amount and frequency of his lateness.  But at first they made it about me "failing to motivate him" to show up on time.  In response I made a somewhat smarmy remark about how keeping his job and his work visa should be motivation enough to show up, which then got me branded as being an insensitive racist, despite the fact that I'm also on a work visa myself.

The thing is that many people in HR also selectively enforced rules.  For example, you were supposed to swipe in at check-in point closest to your physical desk, and not the one next to the underground parking garage where you enter the building.  But I knew people who got written up for it, while others did not.

&gt;I just checked, and noticed the absence of any such rule. But I'm guessing that there was one right after the intervention? I saw an admin play that game on another site - take action, and then edit the rules after the fact.

Yeah, they will claim that they changed it, and then changed it back.  A lot of subs are doing this, or they'll just claim that enforcement is at "moderator discretion" - so that anything can be twisted to mean anything else.

just in case the mods decide to set that to private, later on. By no means am I suggesting that anybody should go over and bother these people. I would most seriously ask that people refrain from such behavior, which would only give political ammunition to this crowd, and lead others to forget who the genuine assholes in this case, really are.

But let's remember who these people are, so when in the future we see them again, and they claim to be these poor, misunderstood makers of peace, everybody will know what they are really all about. The mere fact of their presence on that team says it all.

As for myself, I'm just going to block them all and be done with them, and then think about whether or not this site is worth my time. From what I've been hearing, this kind of thing goes on a lot on Reddit.</div>

&gt;"But I see worse!" Please report comments you feel are rule violations. Other rule violations do not excuse your own.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But they started it!" Regardless, you still participated in a petty spat instead of disengaging and reporting. Someone else's bad behavior does not absolve your own.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But you could have just asked me to edit it!" The removal notice is letting you know the comment broke the rules. If you want to resubmit a revised non-rule breaking version, go for it.  
&gt;  
&gt;"But what else am I supposed to call them?!" Asshole. Or nothing. Saying nothing is an option if you can't comment within the rules.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, let's note that the husband of the OP was not one of the participants in the discussion. In no sense could I have been said to have participated in a "spat" with him. I simply commented on the wrongness of the behavior reported to me, taking the OP at her word. We don't know what her name, her husband's name, or the names of either of their sons are. We're simply replying to her description of the events. The husband could, if he had wished, shown up in the discussion using his own account, and aside from maybe the OP, none of us would have ever known. Nothing I said was going to affect his reputation, either online or offline, so in what way was I attacking him?

Also, how is the word "asshole" not an insult? The rules, as given in that reply, are self-contradictory.

The theory of the mod's defense, however, was still easy to see in that reply: since the husband might not have felt good about himself after reading what I had to say, that made it into an attack. His / her definition of "attack" was that broad, except when the word "asshole" was being used, because reasons. Completely exasperated, I told the mod exactly what I thought of this bizarre abuse of power, writing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That is the dumbest, most snowflake-ish crap I've ever heard.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm done with your sub. To answer the question in the title, yes, you're the asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

and got back a simple, arrogantly dismissive

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;k

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

leaving me with the thought that sometimes, moderation is little more than a form of trolling. This is one of the reasons why I decided that I definitely wanted to have nothing more to do with that subreddit, and probably not much more to do with Reddit, in general, or even with the social web. After I'm left with my blood boiling from the sheer stupid arrogance that I've just run into, I'm also left with a question.

What, as a user, am I supposed to be getting out of this experience that is worth the aggravation?</div>

    <div class="md">*"Calling someone a narcissist or sociopath is a diagnoses"*

That's a bad faith response. Again, this is what I wrote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not being a psychiatrist, I'm not sure whether your husband sounds more like a narcissist or a sociopath, but either way, I'm worried for you and your boys.

&amp;#x200B;

Note that I just said that I'm NOT qualified to make that call. That's not a "diagnosis," that's a refusal to make one.

I'm going to block you, now.</div>
