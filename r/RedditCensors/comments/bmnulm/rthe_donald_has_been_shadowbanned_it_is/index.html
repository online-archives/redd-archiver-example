It's not relevant whether you're a fan of t_d. I'm not a fan of the stomping on your dick with stilettos sub (or subs? Hopefully there's only 1) but that doesn't mean I want them to be silenced. If they want to have their dicks mutilated by a sharp pointy object then let them be happy.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree with all but your last sentence. I think you're looking at it wrong. It's ok to believe that someones fetish for getting your dick stomped is wrong(and frankly imo would be mental illness and shouldn't be encouraged), but silencing them from voicing their opinion prevents any conversation that helps both us and them in understanding how they feel and helps us have the conversation for why we feel its wrong.

So in this case, you shouldn't let them silo themselves and be happy, but rather to let them share what they think and feel so that we can learn something instead of vilifying them.

Now with all that said, how would you treat a community of pedophiles?

And just to play devils advocate, were we even having the conversation in t_d or did we already segregate *us* from *them* and encourage an echo chamber and by banning the sub actually encourages the conversation in a more equal setting.

Edit: added "of pedophiles"</div>

    <div class="md">It will back fire, people never learn from history.... Conservatives tried to silence liberal views and hippies in the 50s and 60s and it made being liberal cool.... It created a massive institution of Democrats....

But no one learns from mistakes..... 

When all the nighttime hosts, and every comedy jumps on one side it becomes uncool, it becomes the "mom and dad stuff" 

When you censor and yell and scream about memes you become the "get off my lawn" guy.


And it will snap back into their face before they know it.... 2020 will still be mostly decided by millennials but 2024 is going to be a lot of generation z..... And Democrats better hope in wrong.


Thing is polls are showing I'm right.

Voters aged 20-30 are about 37% Democrat and maybe 20% GOP. Each step older you become much more likely to support the GOP.


The issue Democrats have is that the under 20 poll is at 36% Democrats 22% GOP.

( I can't find the damn link to it sadly but was a well done University poll)


Well in the last 40 years, you always had a larger % of Democrat the younger you went.... As you age, you always tend to shift towards GOP.

So if under 20 is already slightly more GOP than 20-30 year olds the Democratic party is in a world of hurt in 6-10 years.

Just think if right now the age 31-45 was 3-4% more GOP....

That's who can donate to campaigns, that's who can go out and be active, go to rallies, and votes more than younger ages and voted way way more in midterms than younger ages.

In what is already a dead lock race often, that is a huge difference.</div>

    <div class="md">Alternative platforms are starting to get bigger because of it. The thing is they are banking "conservative" voices, but the audience for a them are mostly in the middle politically. Those of us who see there are good points on both sides. If you silence the people I want to hear from so I can make my own decisions I'm just going to follow them to the alternate platforms.

Which is good because then the alternative platforms start getting more diverse thought, and that's what matters most.</div>
