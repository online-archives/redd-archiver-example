    <div class="md">Well yeah, that sub has been an agenda sub for a long time now. Their echochamber shrinks daily with how well the US and President Trump is doing, so at this point, it's a few dozen kids talking to bots and fake accounts. 

Let's say you're a day 1 Reddit user and not a stupid 19yr old blue haired kid. You wander over to that sub and see that all the top posts are all in some way anti President Trump, and most every source is missing credible sources or data. It's mostly opinion pieces from asshurt losers. You dont think that the new face realizes they are in an echochamber? Oh they do, and that is one point that gets brought up whenever new faces show up to T_D. "if they post all this nonsense, what are  they trying to prevent me from seeing".

and as such, T_D grows organically, and the agenda subs turn into places of nonsense and little matter.</div>

    <div class="md">There was a recent review of the subs by.. hell, I dont remember. But T_D had less bots than the known agenda subs. 
Thing is, with T_D, you had to opt in. Old subs like politics and worldnews were defaulted subs that people or accounts rather, never left.

Its like with any news source really; if you want actual factual news, you need to consume news from various sources, across both sides of the aisle, and see what holds water.

    <div class="md">No.. T_D has a rule, that's different than censoring. The rule clearly states it's a sub for support of the President. You may not agree with the rule, but that's the rule and why the sub was created.

    <div class="md">????

You’re making stuff up now. It’s literally in the rules. T_D is a 24/7 rally. It’s a party place, it acknowledges itself as a closed place for supporters only. The report button is a deport button. Why would you crash a party you weren’t invited to, trash talk the host, then complain when you’re thrown out?

Meanwhile, these default subs claim to be neutral, but are about as neutral as T\_D. The difference is T_D says it up front rather than lying about it like the default subs. </div>

    <div class="md">I think you're capable of understanding the subs rules, so I'll give you another example.

If the Portland Trailblazers had a sub for their NBA team and they said "all posts will be pro Trailblazers team decisions, we support this team" and you come in and say "this teams backcourt sucks, we need to fire the management".. your post would get deleted. 

Now that I have given you an example a 5th grader can comprehend, you get it.

    <div class="md">Ok, let us clear some things up here.

- if you live in the US, Trump is your president. Deal with it. 

- This is not an /r/politics echo chamber, nor is it an expansion of T_D

- T_D is a fan club. Don't point out censorship in that sub when it's clearly not a sub for discussion for anything other than pro-Trump posts.

- have a friendly open discussion on this post, provoking other members because their view doesn't agree with you will have you removed.

Play nice.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh.

Many people mistake posts on this subreddit as support for Trump or right leaning. This post is simply pointing out the censorship and rule breaking/ignoring by the mods. The fact that much of the activity called out by this subreddit tends to only occur for posts that go against Trump is the choice of the mods who are allowing the rule breaking and censorship. We're simply cataloging it. </div>

    <div class="md">The only right leaning sub I follow is /r/The_Donald. That subreddit has a clear rule against saying anything bad about Trump. Making a rule, then enforcing that rule, is not censorship. If /r/WorldNews made a rule that said "Any of these rules can be broken as long as the post smears Trump." then this post wouldn't make sense because they'd just be enforcing their rules.</div>
