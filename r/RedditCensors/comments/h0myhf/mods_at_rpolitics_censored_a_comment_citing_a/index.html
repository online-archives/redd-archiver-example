    <div class="md">Too bad the article is behind a paywall.  

I found this reaction to it marginally amusing:

&gt;Now, Knox and Princeton political scientist Jonathan Mummolo are pushing back against those conclusions with a critique that was published on the preprint server SSRN. They say the PNAS study is “uninformative” about racial bias because it assumes that black and white officers encounter black civilians in equal numbers. They illustrate their critique with a thought experiment in which a black officer encountered 90 black civilians and 10 white, whereas a white officer encountered the reverse. If both officers shot five black civilians and nine white civilians, the raw results seemed to validate the approach of the PNAS study: The white officer was indeed no more likely than the black officer to shoot a minority. But once the encounter rates were taken into account, it was clear that the white officer shot 50% of the black civilians they encountered and only 10% of the whites, revealing obvious racial bias, the authors write.

...and the black officer shot 90% of the whites but only 5.5% of the blacks in this same thought experiment, but that doesn't tip them off that there might be something wrong with it. Maybe they think that there was a way bigger problem of black-on-white racism, tho</div>

    <div class="md">First of all, your citation had nothing to do with the comment chain. You simply posted it to post it. Any mod would see that for what it was.

Secondly, I would like to know your level of education and/or qualifications. Because based on your reading of this paper and what you've quoted, you display no skill in critically reading scholarly articles/studies.

Thirdly, the quote you picked is completely cherrypicked from the larger abstract. I suspect you saw this somewhere and are just reposting it, but whoever originally posted it just cherrypicked the information.

Because as the ABSTRACT says:

&gt;The vast majority of people killed by police are armed at the time of their fatal encounter, and more thantwo-thirds possess a gun.

&gt;African Americans are disproportionately killed by police officers nationwide.

&gt;The disproportionate killing of African Americans by police officers does not appear to be driven by micro-level racism. Rather, it is likely driven by a combination of macro-level public policies that target minority populations and meso-level policies and practices of police forces.

&gt;Fundamental macro-level policy changes, as well as changes to meso-level organizational practices, arenecessary to address the root causes of racial disparities in police killings

---

So right there, these authors are saying that blacks are disproportionately killed.

In the study they also go on to say that it's not as much individual bias, but structural, institutional racism. I will remind you the lead author here, Charles E. Menifield himself, is a black male. So while he might have a bias on the micro, you cannot impugn him.

He notes:

Until 2013, the federal government failed to even properly count killings, so his study begins in 2014 and goes to 2015. This is responsible. Because any data from before the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2013 would not be valid.

They note right away that numerous studies have shown *anyway* that blacks are disproportionately killed.

They make the point that the "bad apple" theory (the micro) is wrong, because even POC officers are killing blacks, which is a macro problem as it is systemic and institutionalised. 

They cited a study that diversity had no impact on reducing police violence. That it's institutional.

Look...I'm gonna skip ahead because I'm not gonna re-write their article and if you can't be bothered to read it, you probably won't read this comment either. I'm just leaving it here for anyone who comes by and sees your full of shit.

Go to the bar graphs. 

Page 6. The top.

Whites are killed more, which no one denies and is to be expected because there are simply more of us. More whites die of cancer in the USA because there are more whites. No lying with statistics. 

It shows that blacks had DOUBLE the proportion of deaths than whites. 

That bar graph is so simple, even a child would understand it.

What you posted is completely out of context and contrary to the report.

And, in fact, I am going to email the authors myself from my academic email address just so they can lose faith in humanity at how manipulative you are.</div>

    <div class="md">You wrote a lot of words - go ahead and look up crime rates per capita by race and let me know if you think the disproportionate violent crime rates might have *some tiny, small part to play* when we discuss which races are killed by police most often (per capita - more whites are killed every year). And note that nobody, anywhere is even talking about justified vs unjustified killings.

Imagine 100% of crime was committed by whites, all shootings were justified, and you were sitting here arguing that the system was clearly racist.

Would it be? And if your answer is still yes then it's "always racist" which is vacuous.</div>
