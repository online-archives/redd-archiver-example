    <div class="md">There are some people who post there that actually take the time to argue their point and it is enjoyable to have a civil debate. Granted you will usually get the random person who will interject some great words of wisdom like "Get Bent Senile Boomer"... but I would like a place that would allow actual discussion of politics without the mods pulling some nefarious shit like this. The fact that they are actually hiding it so you wouldn't even know that people are posting and it being auto hidden makes that echochamber even more of an illusion not supported by reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Also I guess point of posting this is so that the next person who notices what I noticed and searches google may find this exact thread and it will save them the trouble of thinking the mods at /r/politics are anything but giant douches.</div>

    <div class="md">I asked... I got as much of a response as you see above. 

No posts were "removed" per say, but literally no matter what I post on /r/politics you will never see the actual comment because their automod will automatically hide it as censored the second I post it... To me it looks like it is still there but if I log off reddit and look at the comment it will not show up.



I actually tried to stay positive. On another account I actually only posted neutral comments and didn't post much and still ended up on the limbo list. My guess on that account is because I posted a breakdown on why I think Bernie's plan for paying for Medicare for all is missing about 15 trillion from his proposal based on the numbers he provided and other reports.

The fact that once you ask them a question related to their shitty policy they won't ever respond. Which is actually a violation of the reddit user agreement</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah they're probably using your "ban evasion" status as motivation to ignore you.

Point is though that you won't get much attention on these censorship subs unless you provide evidence of what you were saying and what got removed. We get plenty of toxics and spammers whining when they got rightfully banned.

I advise blocking that sub, it improved my mental health enormously.</div>

    <div class="md">Actually it isn't ban evasion because they never actually banned me. Which is why what they are doing is actually in violation of reddits user agreement. Already talked to some admins and they agreed it isn't ban evasion cause on their end they don't see a ban..

&gt;What proof do you need

Something like this

https://www.reveddit.com/user/superlaserblaster/?all=true

 You can show the particular comments that are archived as removed and sometimes the source of the removal.

My guess is terms like "bernie bro" are automatically flagged by automod for deletion maybe some of the other "buzzwords" that the mods decided to add to their nono filter.. 
But you have some ones on there that are obviously manually removed by mods for no reason other than blatant agenda driving, imo.</div>

    <div class="md">Damn, yeah that says everything. That sub isn't worth it. And that's coming from someone who believes that saying the right thing in the right place in the right thread can make the world of a difference for a number of others.

I'm surprised you weren't subjected to the 8 minute cool down too.

Funny how the single comment of your other account removed that I disagree with is the one that was manually approved by the mods. Is simply using alts against TOS? Admins and mods have freely admitted to partaking.

Honestly it feels like the normal user-experience of this site is that of shills in training being led by the various partisan superpac PR managers who work as mods and admins. Steady corporate capture of free speach.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Is simply using alts against TOS? 

The thing is, there is absolutely no way they would know this account was an alt (and no.. Alts do not violate the reddit user agreement unless you are using them for ban evasion). I signed up for it using an old old email that has nothing in common with my current email (it is an old MSN account for back before google was even a thing) while using a secured VPN to Canada. I did these things not because I was trying to evade but I wanted to test to see if what happened on my current account would happen on a completely neutral account, and sure enough it did. What really pisses me off is that this 100% violates the reddit TOS/User Agreement and they are in control of one of the largest political subs because back in the day, it was a default sub that everyone automatically got enrolled in. I have an account</div>

    <div class="md">Great insight thanks. I know my account tells me my IP activity so I have to wonder if they have backend tools that can be used to check and unless you were maintaining that vpn separation the account might have been flagged as an alt. Just a guess though I'm not familiar with their tools.</div>

The only ones who would have access to IP addresses would be paid staff members, and they would be held to a lot of legal requirements and i doubt they would get involved in something like this unless it is against the user agreement/TOS (like ban evasion).</div>

    <div class="md">People like you don't belong on Reddit. You're too pure for this shit hole.

This is an echo chamber site for retards like myself that like to troll others a lot and don't give up all that easily.

It's extremely difficult to find yourself a worthwhile conversation over politics. Here, certainly, but It's probably the same way most places. Everyone has mostly picked a side, and it's not about policies and platforms any more.

Identity Politics is the order of the day.</div>

    <div class="md">I probably don't. The admins certainly don't like that I'm here all that much I'm sure. I mostly post comments though, not posts/threads, so I think people like me fly under the radar more than some others.

Part of the fun for the last little while was getting under the skin of the easily enraged, but it's getting old as all things eventually do.

&gt;lets make our own Reddit, with blackjack... And hookers...

Sounds like a plan!
I think they've tried doing this type of thing before, and the DDoS attacks come on fast and strong.

I don't have time or inclination to deal with any of that.</div>
