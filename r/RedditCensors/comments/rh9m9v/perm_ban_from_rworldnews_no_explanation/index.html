      <div class="md">Just got perm'd from worldnews, no explanation. Didn't break any rules, posted my opinion and was downvoted to hell, verbally attacked, then perm'd. The comments that verbally attacked me were removed by mod because they were clear hateful attacks. The account that made those hateful attacks is not banned, and is still participating in discussions. I have reached out but no response.

Edit: Got a response, and was muted. They said "You're not entitled to know another user's ban status. You can promote  homophobia somewhere else, we're not interested in platforming it here." My "homophobia" was my opinion that having a mom and dad present for raising a child is important, coming from my experience not having it. Liberal behavior at its finest.

Edit: Now I understand why only certain beliefs are prevalent there. Anyone who differs in opinion is perm'd and muted, regardless if they followed rules. I found it weird that all of the comments were oriented left, with no disagreements. SPEECH MUST BE FREE!

    <div class="md">Ah yes, Worldnews.  
I got banned from there because I dared doubt the covid narrative and supported said doubt with articles from harvard, Oxford and Mayo clinic about how covid vaccines only help  relative to the already exiting risk you had and not as an absolute number.  They may lower your risk by 96%, but if you were at a starting risk of 0,0003% then it may not be worth it to lower that to 0,00003% , wheras an old person with comorbidity  who may start out at a 20% risk of hospital or death may benefit from getting it down to 0,6%. 

So that young people who already have a death/hospitalization risk of under 1% should not be compelled to take the vaccine whereas for old people who'se chances of consequences from covid are initially much higher it may be useful.   


Despite providing all sources I was still banned for "misinformation"</div>

    <div class="md">i don't really have to go there to find homophobic stuff, your bullshit just happens to be homophobic enough

&gt; having a mom and dad present for raising a child is important, coming from my experience not having it

let me explain. you say here that don't have the experience of being raised by both parents. thus you

* can't compare it with anything
* even if you could, you couldn't use your own single experience to make statements such as "it's important" because that's just not scientific

so the reader can rightfully assume that your statements come from your fear of the gay.</div>

    <div class="md">what you did was, you took the common (and pretty much valid idea) that having a full family (or rather, not having one or less parents) is good for kids and put it on top of your situation. this might be semantics, but if this kind of thing makes you make far fetching conclusions, maybe talking semantics is a must. there's a mount of evidence re: outcomes of kids of gay parents. if you are willing to ignore that and just stick to your experience... better ask yourself why you are doing that</div>
