    <div class="md">The truth isn't racist, which is a cop out for things that hurt bugman's feelerz and use it when there's a self evident situation that occurs.

Example: These fat pieces of human shit can't be good upstanding citizens and customers by paying their fucking bill and stop smoking weed in a restaurant. Anybody who speaks honestly about this incident is automatically a "RAYCIS" and is done so to shut down any kind of criticism.

"My friend, X, did ABCD and has a rap sheet long of offenses, but free him since I know he's a good guy."

Calling something that is a bitter truth "racist" is why we can't have an honest discussion. All those faggots are the same people that scream "RAYCISS" and "Yt SupremuhCY" when you see how far BLM was able to call death to White people and cops under Osamba.

These shitlibs use PC poopytalk to not offend anybody, but offend White people? All day.

Now ask yourself this: If these people were White do you think these people would be telling those criticizing these scum in the videos not to because it's "racist"? (Rhetorical question; it's a hell-fucking-no.)</div>

    <div class="md">So how should someone react when other evidence, such as poverty, density of housing, and ability to advance in society account for undesirable behavior better than simple skin color? Because when you record the actual data as opposed to relying on the memory of an individual, you see that statistics like this predict much more accurate results on both sides. 


Of course the people wouldn't say anything about race. The reason race is ever brought into anything is because it seems to stand out to the crowd viewing it. Notice that the people who just said "Fuck those people." weren't deleted or down-voted.

&gt;That doesn't do anyone justice. They should actually put people in jail. All that's been learned here is that you can get away with smoking weed in a public restaurant and dashing on a 400$ bill.

&gt;Nah fuck that, they stole and that restaurant owner needs to grow a spine. Granny you a real one, but you're enabling that shit. Fuck all that.

&gt;Gonzales is too good for this world. These people won't learn from their behavior by being forgiven, they'll almost certainly do it again. This was 12 people planning out a theft of $500 (counting tip). Really wish he'd continue pressing charges...

These aren't racist, and they speak negatively of the fuckers who tried to skip out, but they don't bring race into it.

Also, yes, I made a mistake there, poverty isn't the issue, it's actually "Relative poverty" or the wealth of neighboring individuals, compared to the individual. I would like to see the source for wealthy blacks committing more crimes than similarly situated whites.</div>

You didn't need to, you just seem to distance yourself from both of them.

God, you seem like a really angry person, you throw in more Ad Hominems than arguments towards your point, how do you plan to ever convince anyone of your point of view with how often you insult people?
