I replied to a user who said: 

&gt;Every time I think I'm done hearing from Hilary Clinton, she comes back from the grave to let us know how terrible she is. 

With:

&gt;Did you hear her podcast earlier this year? 

&gt;https://youtu.be/nLdz9-fdp8o 

&gt;It's insane too, especially when you find out she and her camp were't just threats to democracy by colluding with DNC and MSM (and social mesia astroturf) to stop Bernie (not to mention reject policy that is overwhelmingly popular among democrats and among most Americans across party lines) but that Russiagate was a Hillary Clinton concocted conspiracy. Her people had more ties to Russia than Trump or his people apparently! And the 'threat of fascism' that was in the WH, was literally thanks to Hillary and her type of dem, neoliberalism and neoconservatism, not to mention Clintonite dems like Biden - who are literally just as authoritarian as Trump. I don't even think Obama was less authoritarian than Trump. The hypocrisy of the neoliberal crowd is truly astounding. 

&gt;Bonus for those interested in Russiagate:

&gt;https://youtu.be/HKDRxSQMa-M 

&gt;Edit: Russell Brand made a video about it and he is not a right-winger or fan of Trump. 

&gt;https://youtu.be/0k6X03XvxW

That comment was removed and I received this in the mail:

&gt;You have been temporarily banned from participating in r/alltheleft. This ban will last for 3 days. You can still view and subscribe to r/alltheleft, but you won't be able to post or comment. 

&gt;Note from the moderators: 

&gt;&gt;Jimmy Dore is not permitted to be posted here. He’s a right wing piece of shit. Posting him again on this sub will result in a perma-ban. 

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/alltheleft by replying to this message.

I never saw any rule against posting Jimmy Dore and I was pretty sure I have posted him there before.

I wrote back:

&gt;I disagree with him being a right-winger and grifter but regardless, since when are mods here pro-censorship??? I can't even reply to that thread and defend myself against accusations of being a Russian troll. Why? After having contributed here so many times, this is how I am treated? 

&gt;Also, what part of those videos are him promoting the right-wing or spreading misinformation/disinformation? Aaron Mate covers Russiagate pretty thoroughly, as does Matt Taibbi and a couple others like Caitlin Johnstone. Even Russell Brand made a video about it and he is pretty clearly a leftist and no fan of Trump. But seriously what the actual fuck is up with this censorship? This place was one of the last leftists spaces to not try and control discourse and now this...

Did a search and here are two posts I made there previously on Dore and at the time writing this they are still up: 

https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/l0et80/jimmy_dore_on_censorship 

https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/mdul6u/the_democratic_party_is_bought_and_paid_for_by

I was pretty sure I posted Jimmy Dore videos there before that were approved/allowed up (again these are up at the time of writing this):

https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/o7ov8o/cenk_uygurs_lies_smears_obliterated_by_aaron_mat%C3%A9 

https://np.reddit.com/r/alltheleft/comments/o2273p/tyts_disgusting_misogyny_hypocrisy_their_false

Just a couple ^

I post to r/alltheleft frequently and I have posted a bunch of times there criticizing Russiagate and have never had my posts removed.

Edit:

Mod replied:

&gt;This isn’t a debate sub Reddit here to try to redeem assholes like Dore as dore is unquestionably a right wing anti vax grifter piece of human garbage. The comment calling you a troll will also be removed and that user messaged to knock it off.

I replied with:

&gt;&gt;as dore is unquestionably a right wing anti vax grifter piece of human garbage

&gt;Again, I am questioning that narrative and don't think he is a right-wing grifter and AFIAK he is double vaxxed and has told people to get vaxxed so I don't think he is anti-vax. Being anti-mandates is not equal to being anti-vax. There were figures who were anti-mandates and were even promoting vaccine hesitancy if not outright saying they would not take the vax under the previous administration, like Kamala, Pelosi, Biden, Fauci and the ACLU. Still, what is up with the censorship? This is the first time I am experiencing this here and I have posted Jimmy Dore content at r/alltheleft before (including videos - which are mod approved) so this really caught me by surprise and is disappointing. Then I have people calling me comrade and Russian troll, I don't want them censored, I would rather be able to defend myself against these bogus accusations and provide more evidence for those claiming it's a right-wing conspiracy to point out how Russiagate was created by the Hillary camp.

Mod replied with:

&gt;This is a sub-reddit for Leftists to post Leftist content. Jimmy Dore is not a Leftist. He's a right-wing grifter as far as this sub-reddit is concerned. You being able to post his videos here before is not enough to just post his shit from this point forward as he is no comrade, no friend to Leftism, the working class - nothing - and the 3 day ban was in essence a warning that we can overturn if you agree to not post his shit on the sub moving forward as the next time it happens the ban will be permanent and there will be no chance to overturn it.

&gt;Let us know what you decide on that, otherwise we will see you back on the sub in 3 days. Your choice.

No friend to leftism or the working class, while he promotes left-wing policy and unions, class solidarity and a general strike? I'm baffled. It's like this person has never watched his segments or saw his participation in the M4A march or People's Party convention or him espousing pro leftist/working class and anti-imperialism views back in 2015/2016 and ever since!

I responded with:

&gt;&gt;This is a sub-reddit for Leftists to post Leftist content. Jimmy Dore is not a Leftist. He's a right-wing grifter as far as this sub-reddit is concerned.

&gt;As far as sub is concern or the mods of the sub or select mods or mod?

&gt;Our opposing views of him aside, how can you be pro-censorship and call yourself a leftist?

&gt;&gt;he is no comrade, no friend to Leftism, the working class 

&gt;Yet so much evidence points to the opposite being true. Far far more than anything he says that could even be misconstrued as him being a grifter/right-winger. I don't even know how you can listen to what he has said and championed for and participated in action wise and still say he is a right-winger and no friend to the working class. This exact talking point is pushes about him by actual grifters out the corporate dem establishment. Could it be that you were tricked by this propaganda?

Mod replied with:

&gt;ok this is getting nowhere. See you in 3 days. Post Dore's shit again on this sub-reddit in a way that positions himself as an ally to the working class and the ban will be permanent.

Then got this message:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/alltheleft. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/alltheleft for 3 days.

Posted a tweet by Greenwald and it got the usual replies calling him right-wing/grifter. I replied saying I thought he was a libertarian leaning progressive/left leaning libertarian, but certainly not a right-winger. I replied to another user:

&gt;Just as Dore who self identifies as a progressive/leftist but is labeled a grifter/right-winger and no friend to the working class despite him championing progressive policy, unions/workers rights, platforming AOC, supporting the people's party, joining and promoting M4A marches, promoting force the vote and eftist leaders to leverage their power, promoting class solidarity and general strike. However, posting videos or articles of him here that are not anti-Dore will get you perma banned so I am told by a mod.

Of course my comment was removed not long after, likely reported by those in the thread calling GG a right-winger.
I don't know when mods there started embracing establishment dem propaganda and censorship.</div>

Curious why any would be downvoted if our community is made up of people across the political spectrum and everyone is here in the fight against censorship.

Edit: We have the_mueller shitlibs and Vaush CIA-left types up in here and these people parroting talking points out the neoliberal political establishment, security state and military industrial complex.

Factually incorrect.

&gt;in leagues with Tucker Carlson 

This is innuendo and guilty by association fallacy to smear him as a grifter. If Dore was invited on to liberal MSM outlets, he would go on them, but they don't, so he doesn't.

&gt;and the Boogaloo movement.

Misleading at best.

    <div class="md">&gt;Who does Jimmy spend his time attacking? Is it the Right?

'Attacking,' well that's subjective. I would say legit criticisms and of course he spends more time criticizing dem party and leftist leaders because he is a leftist. He had criticized Trump and the GOP, so I don't know what more you want. If you want a leftist echochamber that ignores dem party corruption and inaction and just posts about GOP/Trump 24/7, try politics.


&gt;Would a millionaire like Tucker and his billionaire handlers let Rightist Jimmy on if he spoke truth to real power?

Why wouldn't they? Jimmy gets platformed and Tucker gets more views and has someone on that criticizes the opposing party, so they both benefit. Maybe you should be more concerned why liberal (supposedly leftist) MSM won't have on anti-establishment anti-imperialism leftist like Dore, but will have on pro-war/imperialism security state people. I'm curious what he said on Tucker's show that is fake news. Will you tell us, because it's what you are suggesting.


&gt;Rutger Bergman got censored from Tucker because he spoke truth to power.

I don't know what to tell you, Jimmy speaks truth to power.

&gt;Jimmy is a far right tool.

You sound like a crazy person. He is easily and clearly to the left of moderate dems nvm dems like Manchin.</div>

    <div class="md">Funny, so Jimmy spends all his time attacking leftists and progressives (including AOC) and shockingly little time complaining about the far more dangerous Right. Perhaps you think the Boogaloo extremists and anti-vaxxers are "left" too. Funny who Jimmy wants to alienate and who he wants to win over. 

The far more dangerous Right brings him on to criticize the Left, and you think this useful anti-vaxxer sexually abusive idiot is on the "left". 


&gt;Why wouldn't they? Jimmy['s anti-leftism] gets platformed and Tucker gets more views


FTFY

    <div class="md">Jimmy Dore assassinated his own character when he attacked AOC and platformed a terrorist movement. The cherry on top was laughing about how he sexually harassed his coworker.

It's not my fault nobody wants to associate with Dore besides right wing grifters like Tucker, militias, and disgraced ex-Intercept journalist Glen Greenwald who thinks Tucker is a socialist. These nuts clearly all have brain rot.

I don't think that is the reason for his criticisms and I don't know why you would say that if you have actually heard his criticisms of her and the squad, which are reasonable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and platformed a terrorist movement
&gt;
&gt;Verifiable fact. 

Context and nuance matters to good faith adults. He interviewed a boogaloo boy. He said be does not endorse them. Saying he platforms a terrorist movement is deceptive af.


&gt;Verifiable fact. I watched him do the laughing about it. That was part of his "debunk."

He made a joke about someone wearing inappropriate attire to work and that someone was his superior (and his joke literally pales in comparison to the things Cenk and Ana have said, look at the atmosphere they fostered trying to be like Howard Stern) and he apologized to her and it was water under the bridge and then years later she tried to blackmail him from criticizing them over their smearing of Aaron Mate.

Yes "jokes" can be, and are, sexual harassment.

    <div class="md">Yet Tucker platformed a leftist.

Like saying 'nice news skirt' sarcastically when someone (a friend and his senior) is wearing something inappropriate for a news room and everyone laughs at it? A bit too many, then Dore felt bad and apologized and she accepted his apology? yeah. Usually sexual harassment holds some sexual intent. Any thoughts on Ana trying to blackmail Dore for him calling out TYT for their smears on Aaron Mate? No?

Again, consider the atmosphere, they guess who's segment segments and Cenk said sexist shit plenty of times and said something to a subordination that could be seen as sexual harassment, asking what price she would accept for nudes. Your outrage is fake or you are misinformed and prefer to stay that way in the face of countervailing evidence.

I don't think he 'sexually harassed' her. You strike me as a troll or an incredible dupe.</div>

You vaush parrots talking points (willingly or otherwise) out the liberal establishment and security state and military industrial complex meant to smear anti-establishment anti-war and imperialism leftists like Dore. Dore is also pro working class and class solidarity in addition to him championing progressive policy/leftist policy, so I am utterly baffled why this mod claims Dore is no friend of workers. Seems like they ate the anti-Dore propaganda and disinformation without a critical thought and don't care to look at evidence that challenges that narrative, which is false btw.</div>

    <div class="md">He isn't anti-vax. 

AOC is left. I don't see your point.

Nice loaded question, fallacious debate seems to be your M.O. 

Who is excusing sexual harassment? It's a bipartisan issue to answer your question. Just see those who have given Biden a pass and those who gave Cuomo a pass for years.

Tucker is a republican. I don't see your point.

Who said faux populism is left? Trump is a faux populist. Dore is a left-winger and an actual populist.

I don't see what point you're trying to make here. This is some gotcha guy shit. So he can't go on 'millionaire show run by billionaire conservatives' to promote pro-working class, anti-war, class solidarity sentiment or otherwise it isn't populism or spreading truth to power??</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;He isn't anti-vax. 

Then why do people keep finding him lying about vaccines


&gt;Who is excusing sexual harassment?

You, apparently



&gt;
&gt; So he can't go on 'millionaire show run by billionaire conservatives' to promote pro-working class, anti-war, class solidarity sentiment or otherwise it isn't populism or spreading truth to power??

Can a right wing terrorist lie his way through an interview with Jimmy?

    <div class="md">Where did he 'lie' about vaccines? Some YouTuber Shaun made a misleading video over him and Dore made a video addressing it and the confusion. Show me where he knowingly lied about the vaccine. 

No.

Maybe watch the actual segment or the Fred Hampton Segment about it that I linked. If you have proof that the person he interview lied to him and is a right-wing terrorist, please post it here. I don't see how it makes Dore a bad person for reaching across the isle - something moderate-centrist dems brag about being able to do.</div>

    <div class="md">Of course I have a problem with them being against **progressives**, but saying they are against dems is misleading, as the dem party is a center center right party and dem leadership sides with moderate republicans and neocons over progressives. Dems collaborate with them on right wing legislation, then use them as an excuse why they can't do more, when in reality, it's just their agenda isn't a progressive one and doesn't include them moving left. 

I'm concerned with my party and it's leadership rejecting and not fighting for policy that is overwhelmingly popular among democrats and popular among most Americans, because it is the more immediate hurdle and threat for progressives, how do you not see that? Are you trolling me with this fallacious argument?</div>

    <div class="md">No, I'm trying to get you to see that you don't get everything you want from one election with a 50/50 senate and THE ENTIRE OTHER PARTY being against your progress.

We need more dems, and we need more progressive dems, the newest members of each party should be obvious that it's getting better, but you're never going to get there with republicans winning and you staying home because "THEY DIDN'T DO WHAT I WANTED FAST ENOUGH" while they have to govern with the other party, you don't get a king from a presidential election.</div>

    <div class="md">okay, so you can see that the squad exists, you just want them to be kings and rule over the dem party and also the republican party because remember, the entire GOP is against your progress, so those 4 have to rule over the entire thing and force their policies, you feel like those 74 million voters that voted for trump will like that or would they react poorly to something like that?</div>

Where is the lie? This line seems like something you repeat to yourself while you spread lies about people.
