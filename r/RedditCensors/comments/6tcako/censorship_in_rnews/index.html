/u/megalynn44 comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dlj65eu/?context=3):

&gt;Why has Reddit become so suppressive of journalism anymore? I get wanting to corporatize because you want to sell ads and make money, but it's gone so far beyond that. Reddit and sites like it were built by the news-junkies who populated them, and now it's become useless for learning about breaking news. You can't get links to primary sources in a timely manner. It's all just click-bait bullshit and suppression of anything of actual interest.

/u/bogusnot comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dlj54pw/?context=3)

&gt;Is R/news starting a mega thread? It says the stories have been submitted but I can't find them. Have they been deleted?

my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dlj6qcb/?context=3)

&gt;And you can't even post the video of it to /r/videos because it's too political, so it has to go to /r/politicalvideo , which hardly anyone looks at. A year ago this video would have been the top post on that sub already.

&gt;edit:

&gt;And now the mods have deleted /u/megalynn44 and /u/bogusnot comments.

and another of mine [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dlj8v2i/?context=3)

&gt;And to get even more messed up, the mods just deleted the above comments.

There are a lot of other comments of mine that were deleted, but it's pointless to list them all.

/u/Redklaw comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dlj9kwv/?context=3) - they were apparently banned from /r/news as well.

&gt;The horrible content that got deleted:

&gt;/u/bogusnot

&gt;Is R/news starting a mega thread? It says the stories have been submitted but I can't find them. Have they been deleted?

&gt;/u/megalynn44

&gt;Why has Reddit become so suppressive of journalism anymore? I get wanting to corporatize because you want to sell ads and make money, but it's gone so far beyond that. Reddit and sites like it were built by the news-
&gt;junkies who populated them, and now it's become useless for learning about breaking news. You can't get links to primary sources in a timely manner. It's all just click-bait bullshit and suppression of anything of actual &gt;interest.

&gt;Thank you mods, for protecting my fragile mind from any open discussion / criticism of how things work here.

&gt;Edit: And now I've been banned lol.

/u/Redklaw comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dljazns/?context=3)

&gt;Don't expect my post to last much longer, they got the one above it a second ago. I'm not sure what rules anyone here is breaking besides being critical of the way this incident was being managed on this subreddit.

There are many more examples, but those are just the ones I caught.

After seeing all those comments deleted, I replied to a comment made by a /r/news mod [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6tajuf/videos_show_car_crash_into_protesters_cnn_video/dlj9aoq/) and asked why all these comments were being deleted - 2 minutes later I was banned [from /r/news](http://imgur.com/a/KpsjW).

Some [screencaps](http://imgur.com/a/hMYRR)

There are many reports of questions to the mods about what's happening being met with mocking and insults and then being banned / muted.
