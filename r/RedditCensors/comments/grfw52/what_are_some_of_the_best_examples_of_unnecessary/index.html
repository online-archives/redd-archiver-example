I wondered if you guys could help me out and point me in the direction of some of the best examples of the mods/admins censoring content for no reason (not breaking rules etc.) other than it going against their personal views or for some other shady reason. Bonus points if there's potential they might have been bribed to do so. 

Thanks in advance for any replies!</div>

Mate, to be honest just check this out and filter by top.

There is also r/subredditcancer as well.

Let us know when you're done. I want to see it.

*I've made this post a temporary announcement so others can see it and help out*

    <div class="md">Thank you! I have had a look through some of the posts on here, will continue to do so and also check out r/subredditcancer, thanks for that suggestion.

It could be a couple of weeks till the video is out, might even end up being in 2 parts as there's a lot to cover aha. But I'll be sure to post it here when I'm done :)</div>

    <div class="md">One thing you got to consider is that Reddit mods are, assholes with agendas and they are  on power trips. Are they corrupt and bought? Probably.

This censorship and fuckery is not exclusive to Reddit. Twitter and facebook does the same the same thing. In America we have something call the Golden Rule which states: **The guys with the gold make the rules.**

Complaining does no good. A class action lawsuit that not only sues the corporation but the weasel piece of shit bean counters who do the bidding for their masters as well. 

I had a couple of pukes from Wikipedia accuse me of vandalizing one of their pages so I doxxed them and contacted their employer. One was claiming to be a "Women's studies professor" she wasn't.  She worked at some rinky dink feminist college.  

All forms of censorship are for shady reasons.</div>
