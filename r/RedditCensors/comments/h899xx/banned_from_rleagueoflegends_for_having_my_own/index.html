      <div class="md">I never had good opinion about mod team on r/LeagueofLegends. And I don't think it will improve in any forseeable future. Yesterday in [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/h7e961/riot_executive_ron_johnson_fired_over_george/) about firing some executive for being racist I made following comment:

&gt; I'd love to express my honest opinion about this situation. But apparently truth is new racism and I don't want to get banned over that.

7 minutes later, without a word of explaination, I got message about permaban. I have never received any warning, temporary ban or anything else, for years I've been active subreddit user, basically I never did anything wrong  prior to that comment.

I decided to write a modmail with question why I got banned. No answer. I did it again today. Silence again. Well, I guess it's finally time to get over it, move on and only feel sorry for other victims of mods who can't even answer a simple question.

EDIT:

Quick update - now I'm even muted by mods, obviously without an answer - https://i.imgur.com/TEjfcgP.png</div>

    <div class="md">I get your point. But in my modmail I underlined 2 things

1. Irrelevance of Floyd's skin colour because I don't care what he looked like, all the traits and behaviours come in all colour. 

2. Fact that police officers killed Floyd. There's no reason to kneel on someone's neck for so long and I'm not looking for any excuses. These officers should face justice in all it's severity, especially the kneeling one.

Neither of things matter when I point out truth - Floyd had criminal past and was under influence of multiple drugs at the moment of death. None of these 2 facts is related to being black. And yet allegedly it's racism. I'll get it if you won't agree with me. I just didn't want to be misunderstood.</div>

None of those 2 facts are really relevant to the discussion, though. He shouldn't have been killed, period. 

However, there's absolutely no reason to be banned for making that statement.</div>

    <div class="md">George Floyd was fucking murdered, period...

YES, he was probably high as fuck on multiple drugs, and YES, he resisted arrest, and YES, he was a shitty person all around...

What that cop did to him was inexcusable, and almost everyone agrees with that.

However, now anyone who even mildly questions the narrative that black people are being hunted down by police and killed on sight...  they're being silenced, because that goes against the talking points of the day.</div>

    <div class="md">That does not matter **at all**. There is **zero relevance** to the discussion in your statement. Might as well bring up what brand of shoes he was wearing or his favorite cereal, they're facts too, and exactly as relevant to the fact that a cop choked him to death on the street. The obvious reason for bringing that up is as a smear campaign against him to try and justify a cop choking him to death in the street, so if that is indeed not your motivation here, what exactly is?</div>

    <div class="md">Exactly. I can't find it right now but the police one time shot in the back and killed a deaf man for not complying with their commands. The cops had body cameras footage and they didn't face discipline because they followed procedures. The issue is people have medical problems, procedure should not be to kill first and claim ignorance later. 

Ignorance of a medical condition is not an excuse. The unborn victims of violence act pretty much spell out that if I harm a pregnant woman and the unborn baby dies I'm guilty of murder even if I didn't know she was pregnant. The same should be true of all medical conditions.</div>

    <div class="md">Okay, can you come up with a reasoning that isn't "I disagree with you" or "Your opinion is problematic" or "You're covering for bad group x y or z"? Why is having an unpopular opinion of an internationally publicized incident, in and of itself, worthy of a *permanent ban*? On a video game sub? Really?

Inb4 "hate speech" 1.) He mentioned (let alone attacked) 0 protected groups, directly or indirectly. 2.) Even if you were certain his unstated opinion is hateful (which you aren't), bans shouldn't be handed out for things he _didn't say_. There were no dogwhistles or direct implications either, just OP saying he *has an opinion*.</div>

In a democracy we have these things called courts and trials where the law is debated. When vigilantes and mobs try to force their own justice on others, then we have a problem.</div>
