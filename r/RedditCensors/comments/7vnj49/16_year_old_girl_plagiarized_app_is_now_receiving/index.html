    <div class="md">Yeah. It appears the desperation to see more women in STEM extends even to lying. If women want to be in STEM then they'll major in something STEMy. Just like if I wanted to be a seamstress I'd go buy some yarn. Do whatever you want. No one cares.

What people do care about, or should, is honesty. </div>

Next, there will be a spin to promote her as a genius female executive for coordinating the project and brilliantly promoting the app. Any mention of her credit thieving plagiarism will be praised and welcomed by today's society molders. 

Liars have their tribe too. They aren't usually held accountable, they often get promoted. Fraudsters think they are being smarter by putting the energy into deceit because it shortcuts actual knowledge towards expertise. They're too dumb to see this as a short-term gain and self-defeating strategy. In many cultures, this is the norm anyways.

Kudos to OP for putting the effort into meaningful preservation of the situation and railing against the scumbag censors as well as the root of the problem. I'm glad you care, OP; it's sad more people don't.

    <div class="md">The fact you berate me for looking at small subs that don't censor shit means you dont care about shit being censored.

Uncensored news posts a lot of bullshit fake new.
World news posts a lot of bullshit fake news.
News posts some fake bullshit.

If all you pay attention to is shitty small subs you'll always rarely be looking at censorship. Its not like this sub is YUUUUGE.

Whenever I find a sub that may breakthrough with not narrative bullshit I sub. Ppd is for the most part trash. So is pretty much any news related subreddit. So..... Maybe try climbing out your own ass. </div>

The post should read "the fact that people need to find niche, small subs just to find the truth is embarrassing. We should be able to trust that the truth is on the popular subs. If a subreddit lies and censors, it shouldn't be popular. Sadly the ones that push for anticensorship tend to be like pussypassdenied; small, niche subs that are not well liked."
