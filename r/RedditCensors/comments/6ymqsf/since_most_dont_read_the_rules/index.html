This sub is dedicated to recording and highlighting instances of ideological censorship of thoughts, ideas, comments, submissions etc on reddit. Some quality standards do apply so read below. Post that fail to meet these guidelines may be removed and violations may result in a ban.

Rules:  

1. Your submission needs to include more than just a link. We expect you to detail what happened, attach sceen-shots, archived links or other relevant information that validates the claims you've made.   
2. Under no circumstances will this subreddit serve as anyone's private army. We exist to highlight the censorship of ideas, opinions etc. on reddit; calls to brigading or harassment will not be permitted.  
3. Low hanging fruit posts aren't welcomed. Going to subreddits that openly enforce an ideology to fish for a ban is not the kind of content we're after.  
4. Your submission of censorship should concern a subreddit that portrays itself on the surface as neutral but isn't. Such as /r/news, /r/europe, /r/worldnews, /r/technology etc.  
5. This sub is open for anyone to participate, but users who do so in bad faith, such as users who themselves engage in or support ideological censorship and then come here to concern troll will not be tolerated.  
6. Catchall rule: trying to cleverly circumvent these rules by arguing technicisms will not work. We reserve the right to intervene to remove trolls, exceedingly low quality submissions and in general content or users that don't fit the theme and functioning of the subreddit.  
7. Site wider rules apply in this sub as in any other sub.


If anything is unclear we ask you to "ask first, do later". We the mods are here to advise you.</div>
