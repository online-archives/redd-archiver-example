Part 2 will be uploaded next Thursday, and will focus more specifically on the "powermods" and the controversies they've been involved in. I have a good chunk of the notes written up for it already but would greatly appreciate any ideas and suggestions to add to this. I haven't been on Reddit *that* long, relatively (about 5 years) so I'm sure there are many scandals I may have missed that maybe someone can fill in the gaps? Thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="md">Cool. Cool cool cool.

Will defo watch later - just watched the first 2/3 min.

Its the hypocrisy of the mods that really gets to me. Allowing one person to do something and not others. Redit admins dont seem to interested in holding them to any standard of fairness or human decency. 

In the future there will be no human mods except in the places like donald. All other forums, chats, comment sections and reddits will be done fairly without bias at incredibly fast speeds (almost instantaneously) by bots / GI (general intelligence - prefered term for AIs - we dont want to offend them ha)

Im also huge into boycots but obviously you cant put up users real world names however if you uncover that any of the questionable mods invest or own shares in any businesses i can add them to the blacklist.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, it's all very selective.

That's really interesting and it somehow never crossed my mind... I eagerly await that day lol.

There are some mods whose names are known publicly, for example Gallowboob has done interviews and used his real name. But yeah, most are anonymous.</div>

Edit: good work, and great vid. 

The only thing I'll pick at is maybe the background music be dropped down 1 tiny click.

The music's already at 1%, I think the problem is me not being loud enough. Other people have pointed that out too so I'm just gonna have the mic right in front of me in the next one, hopefully that'll solve it.</div>
