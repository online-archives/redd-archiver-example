Locking the thread comment: Locked, as apparently civil conversation about books is impossible. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday.

One of the censored comments: I cannot downvote this enough. Do we really want to take this sub down that rabbit hole?

So the mods censor a comment about how the post has nothing to do with books, then the mods post wondering why no one is talking about books. That's some shithole mods. </div>
