[Pakistani Teen Sentenced To Death For 'Adultery.' She Was Brutally Raped By Her Cousin.](http://www.dailywire.com/news/17019/pakistani-teen-sentenced-death-adultery-she-was-amanda-prestigiacomo) ([comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6efyx9/pakistani_teen_sentenced_to_death_for_adultery/))

It rocketed up to +26 within a few minutes and got 8 comments, but suddenly most of the comments disappeared and the post disappeared from the new queue.

I asked the mods why but heard silence for a day. I asked again and was told it violated a guideline. I asked which guideline and got silence for a day. I asked again and got this:

Since it happened so early in the post's history, this was a relatively minor deletion...However, whether you want to call this incompetence or censorship (it reflected poorly on Islam), it happens constantly. It's rare that deletions like this are even discussed; the vast majority of deletions and modmail abuse on this site is silent, with no way for users to make meta posts questioning a subreddit's mods.


This later point, about mods censoring all criticism of their behavior, is also endemic to Reddit, and something the TwoX moderators also do to protect their unjustifiable deletions. To prove it I made a post civilly asking the TwoX community directly if the mods weren't in error in this case, and the TwoX mods very quickly deleted it, again without explanation: https://snew.github.io/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6evjlt/meta_i_posted_an_article_that_i_felt_was_relevant/</div>

Thank you -and your four low iq up-voters- for demonstrating the stupidity of leftist cunts.  I'm not the OP.  This thread isn't about me. I never posted on the bigoted 2x subforum. 

Someone outta fire your public school teachers.  They failed you and now you're illiterate.  So sad.

Not that they had much to work with.</div>

Proof of my initial assertion.  She disagrees with me, so she leaps to defend the rapists of women.  No further proof is needed that the 2xc forum is founded and populated by the most despicable, hatefilled animals on the planet.  Short of course the Admin staff that does the same thing.

Not a word to defend the innocent child, but boy howdy can she defend those burying the crime and silencing women.</div>

    <div class="md">Here's my surreal experience with TwoX, a year ago: http://i.imgur.com/Qc95aGC.png

At that point I was still a bit confused about "banning" vs "shadowbanning", but it doesn't impact on the case.

Banned, nobody will tell me why, no warnings.

Unfortunately, when evil, shitty people are those who take the lead and organize in "feminist" and "women's" groups, then that will inevitably have an impact on the perception of "women's movements", justifiably so (the participants there could revolt, reject the moderators and/or find another subreddit - they don't).</div>
