      <div class="md">Commented in /r/LockdownSkepticism, one of the few places on reddit that hasn't gone full hysteria/fearmongering-mode. Got automatically banned from: 

/r/pics, /r/Showerthoughts, /r/HolUp, /r/rant, /r/PoliticalHumor, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong, /r/sandiego, with the same message:

&gt; You have been permanently banned from participating in r/pics. You can still view and subscribe to r/pics, but you won't be able to post or comment.
&gt; 
&gt; Note from the moderators:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; * You have been banned for participating in a covid disinformation subreddit (wuhan_flu, churchofcovid, coronaviruscirclejerk, or lockdownskepticism) which brigades other subreddits and spreads medical disinformation.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * This action was performed by a bot which does not check the context of your comment.  
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * **To be unbanned** EITHER delete your comments there, OR wait 24hrs to respond here, AND respond to this message with a promise to avoid that subreddit. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * Any other response will be ignored and is consent for us to mute you. 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * [Note that health misinformation, namely falsifiable health information that encourages or poses a significant risk of physical harm to the reader, violates the TOS](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151) 
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; * You can report misinformation on reddit by using this form:  http://www.reddit.com/report?reason=this-is-misinformation
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/pics by replying to this message.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to go with a non-confrontational approach to start:

&gt;How have you determined the subs you listed are brigading and spreading medical disinformation? What evidence do you have? I've been observing /r/LockdownSkepticism for over a year and have not seen such a thing.

After no response for 4 days I followed up with:

&gt;The lack of response after 4 days tells me that you have no evidence and are simply manipulating reddit according to your own personal biases.

&gt;The reddit admins recently said that's not allowed, so at minimum you're at risk of losing your sub that you're using to manipulate reddit. Possibly your accounts may also get suspended.

Result: Muted 28 days.

&amp;#x200B;

/r/thanosdidnothingwrong is unique:

This is a sub that supports the notion of killing half of the people on the planet due to overpopulation. 

&gt; This is really unexpected to be coming from your sub. The other subs that I got this ban message from – sure, just power tripping mods trying to enforce their worldview on others. But your sub... the whole ethos and idea behind your sub seems to be entirely in conflict with this.
&gt; 
&gt; How have you determined the subs you listed are brigading and spreading medical disinformation? What evidence do you have? I've been observing /r/LockdownSkepticism for over a year and have not seen such a thing.

But still no response. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since my amiable approach wasn't working I decided to go straight for the jugular with some:

&gt; /r/LockdownSkepticism absolutely does not brigade other subreddits nor spreads medical disinformation. That's some seriously disturbing 1984 content you're bringing to life.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sure the moderators of /r/HolUp have been selected and appointed per their qualifications to determine what is and isn't medical disinformation? Or more likely perhaps, you are simply manipulating reddit according to your own personal biases, and trying to force your own biases and desires on others?
&gt; 
&gt; Either way, I have repented, and I request forgiveness for my crime of wrongthink. I'm so thankful that you care enough to reeducate me and attempt to prevent myself and others from forming independent thoughts and opinions. I was wrong to trust the epidemiologists on /r/LockdownSkepticism. I should have instead PM'd the /r/HolUp mods to ask their opinion. What an embarrassing mistake I made.

Last year, Spez says it's not allowed, after a group of power mods tries to forcefully get their way: https://old.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/</div>
