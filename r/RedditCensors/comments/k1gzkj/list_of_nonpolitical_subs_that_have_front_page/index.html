Anything against the narrative gets downvoted to oblivion, so just block them. It doesn't even matter how polite and reasonable your comment is, whether it includes citations, etc... it will still get downvoted to effective censorship. [Example.](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/k0re93/coronavirus_cases_in_victoria_vs_other/gdkixf3/)

So just block them so eliminate their annoying propaganda and have a much better/easier time browsing on reddit. Yes, you'll have to sacrifice seeing their other genuinely non political posts, but it's easily worth it.

    <div class="md">This guy is hilarious. 

Not only does his username tell us where he stands politically (idiotic that lockdowns should be politicized, but here we are) but he's upset because every popular recruit sub has a leftward bias. 

"Please, help me block out reality."

The other hilarious thing is the thread on here where op can't even have a conversation without accusing the other poster of not "arguing in good faith".

If you really want to evolve, op, try reading some really wild stuff that you disagree with. Try to not have thoughts that are "in bad faith" as you read. You might just learn something.</div>

    <div class="md">Leftist bias is reality?

I'm talking about people who aren't leftists having a better browsing experience. Seems futile to engage in any sort of discussion with them as they tend to engage in multiple logical fallacies, argue in bad faith, and just gang downvote against the narrative. 

Lockowns are inherently political. I highly encourage non leftists to avoid these subs! :)</div>

See, the thing I think you still don't understand is that it's not any one person. The decisions to lockdown and enforce curfews are proven to work.  It's math. It's science. 

But I guess if you don't trust math and science they that doesn't mean much.</div>

If something works then you have to define a measurable goal. 

What is that for lockdowns?

&gt; But I guess if you don't trust math and science

This is a good example of arguing in bad faith. We both have opposing assertions, and we both claim scientific reasons. It's not polite to straw man, ad hominem, etc. and makes you look unintelligent.</div>

    <div class="md">You're struggling with the definitions of common words.  You make claims that are wildly askew of scientific consensus. You claim that I'm making ad hominem attacks by disparaging your disdain of actual science.

If you actually cared about science you'd stop using the right wing talking points. It also makes you look like you just learned about, and don't understand, the list of logical fallacies when you attempt to use them incorrectly. 

When someone points out something you're doing, guess what? It's not an ad hominem attack.

You want me to believe that you're arguing in good faith?  Right.

The only point you brought up was the lack of a measurable goal.  You don't think there's a measurable goal? It really shows that you have a completely bizarre and ill informed view of the pandemic that runs against every single country in the world. How could you claim that there's no measurable goal?

It's pretty simple. It's less death.

Are you going to bring up co morbidity to discount the covid numbers?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm guessing you can't parse the difference between the church and the bike shop because you haven't looked into the science behind this. There's a good reason the two are treated differently.

Who stopped you from going to your sisters house? Are people patrolling around and stopping people from going to family houses? I've seen plenty of idiots going to their family's houses. Pictures posted online, people in my neighborhood, etc... Guaranteed there's gonna be a huge covid bump in two weeks.

How were riots and Biden election parties allowed and who allowed them? Was there some sort of notice sent out? 

You really need plant seeds or a baby seat, it seems like there's lots of places to buy them. In fact I bought plant seeds recently and my brother had to buy a child's car seat.  Doesn't really seem like those items are banned or anything. Maybe it was a mistake at home depot. If you really need a car seat from that specific store maybe order it online.

It really doesn't seem like you know very much about what's happening with the lockdowns. Maybe you just need to do a little research and you won't be so angry.

    <div class="md">None of that shit is science based at all. Remember it all started with 2 weeks to prepare the medical system. Now any time cases go up (which is just a virus being a virus and humans being humans), even though deaths have no correlation, they lockdown. South Australia locked down hard over 17 cases.

    <div class="md">If anyone made the lockdown political it was the idiots that are unable to wear a mask, avoid giant crowds and claimed a virus that has now killed 262,000 people was fake.

A lockdown serves a purpose. There is lots and lots of science to back that up, unless you only like sources that confirm your bias of "lockdowns are evil". 

The idea that you could make a statement that broad and ill informed with your user name is what's really bewildering.

Not only is it akin to saying heart disease or cancer is fake but it's like going around giving people free cigarettes and deep fried butter sticks while laughing about how gullible everyone is.

You say you're looking for conservative subreddits.  A conservative subreddit should not be the same thing as being stupid or anti science. Please stop making it easy for people to conflate the two.</div>

    <div class="md">Most of the right believes the government should protect us, but not so far as to restrict us in the way they have. They should ensure people are educated on how to behave, not use the law to force that behavior.

Many on the left welcome the government behaving this way. It's why the left is typically much more ok with higher taxes than the right. The right wants to keep their money because they feel they'll do a better job using it for the greater good than the government. The left though wants everyone to pay more because they feel the government will do a better job for the greater good than individuals could.

It's 100% a political thing.

    <div class="md">...I mean I get people dismissing it because it's the the science they like, but what's race got to do with it? It *does* appeal much more to the right though for exactly the reasons I stated. But nothing about it is any race specifically. Weird.</div>
