    <div class="md">Here are some of the comments that the mods of /r/news didn't want you to see:

/u/KrispyPopcorn1

&gt;How long until this post is locked, deleted and hidden from the front page. God knows how many people's comments the mods have already removed.

/u/ThatsBushLeague

&gt;To be fair, one of the guys thought the kid needed an exorcism, so that's how he ended up there. So just don't look like you need an exorcism and you should be good?

/u/sylect

&gt;do muslims engage in exorcisms? i genuinely don't know. an alternative joke you could make if they don't is that the kid was both gay so they hung him from some local construction equipment, or the boy started to identify as a woman so they stoned him for not wearing a hijab. there are so many options when it comes to mocking the standard, everyday practice of muslims the globe over.

/u/TerryBogard88
 
&gt;Religion of peace

/u/FourteenFour 

&gt;they aced the game by playing both the race and muslim cards


/u/Retaliate1st

&gt;Oh look, Islam, who woulda thought...


/u/J4rrod_
&gt;Yeah because all religions, especially Christianity, are constantly going around setting off bombs and training kids to shoot up schools...

&gt;Why don't you call it like it really is instead of making some general statement where you kind of say what you're thinking without fear of being called an islamaphobe


/u/tilt_shift_neon
&gt;Islam. People have come to expect it from that particular religion.

&gt;Whereas Judeo-Christian ethics are the basis of personal dignity and freedom and practically our entire foundation of what we believe to be right and wrong, including yours.


/u/DramaExpertHS38

&gt;Why are people shocked by this? Stuff like this always happen, there's a ton of illegal immigrants that commit crimes and are set free by sanctuary cities.

&gt;The USA is a PC culture, they don't jail criminals in fear of being called racist.




There are definitely more but this is a pain to format at work on my phone.
