What they actually mean is Republicans but wouldn't be allowed to trash that group, as openly as they do, like they can with imaginary Nazis.

There are legitimate issues with /u/-Ph03niX- to be sure, he's a very busy revolutionary, but complaining that he(?) "mods too many subreddits" just makes the person complaining look like they don't know how reddit works. It's not worth it to the admins/management to limit the number of subs a user can mod because they can just make more user accounts.</div>

    <div class="md">That goes into inactive modding though. An account has to be active to mod, and if they aren't active then their subs moved to other people. That means they have to be at least semi active on multiple accounts to keep their subreddits. Although that's pretty simplified from how I understand the system works.</div>
