    <div class="md">It is only subs selling certain items, not any items. On the face, not banning that sub I'm actually relatively OK with.

However, it is very likely that the vast majority of the sellers there don't have the proper business permits and records, which makes anything they sell illegal. Since reddit cannot verify they're all keeping proper records, it should be banned for that reason.</div>

    <div class="md">The admins probably don't have much market for selling ads for stuff listed in that sub.

Admins specifically said they aren't subject to their new "rule" and will have no qualms about selling ads for products that us plebs are no longer allowed to link / trade.

Drug subs weren't even on their radar either, until people started pointing out the hypocrisy.  It's pretty obvious this is all about those advertising dollars.  :(</div>
