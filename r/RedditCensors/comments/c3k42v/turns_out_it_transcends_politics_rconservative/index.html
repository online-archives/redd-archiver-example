I was banned for “sh*tposting,” Rule 5. I started off with some humor and sarcasm, but I was making a sincere point. Most importantly, this style of rhetoric is present throughout the entire subreddit, so that can’t be why I was banned. Further, it wasn’t a flyby insult and run. It resulted in follow up conversations in which I assumed good faith of all participants. I reached common ground with one person. 

To be clear, and I let the mods know this, I was speaking as a conservative. There are libertarian and isolationist wings (not always the same) within US conservatism and they have a rich history. I belong the the rarer, but still recognized, anti-war conservative school of thought (this is the theme of The American Conservative, not my favorite publication albeit). This is also a school of thought Trump has at times promoted! I was not coming in as a liberal attacking Republicans. 

This was before Trump changed his mind on Iran. I wonder if people are getting banned for wanting more with the run now?</div>

    <div class="md">I think I may have gotten banned from /r/Republican for making the case that blowing trillions of dollars on violently social engineering other countries isn’t fiscally conservative. 

They got me on not speaking ill of other Republicans, which I did. I wonder if they are consistent with that rule when Republican infighting occurs.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah most of my argument about the Syria strikes was just trying to argue against the faulty logic of the Syrians gassing a province that they had surrounded knowing full well that gas would bring international action against them. That, plus the fact that Trump ran on a very anti-war platform which was one of the main reasons I voted for him. 

The guy I was arguing with claimed to have told mods to unban me but it never happened.</div>

r/conservative is just as bad as r/politics but on a smaller scale in terms of bias. You have to be as far right as possible to fit in there. I’m pretty moderate but lean right so I’d get shit on a lot there until I eventually just left.

    <div class="md">Hard to say if I have a favorite right now. I regularly read Reason, Stream, and the American Conservative. There’s stuff I love and hate that regularly comes out of these three. But I read them the most. I read the National Review for a long time and gave up on it recently (not as a Trump supporter). 

I have a bunch of other conservative, liberal, and “radical” stuff in my Feedly and podcasts, but I can’t say I’m crazy about any of it. I’m very politically dissatisfied, but my work requires me to keep up with what people and “camps” are saying.</div>

    <div class="md">Conservativism is so infested with Zionism and israeli puppets that its a shit hole. r/the_Donald banned anyone who complained about the Israeli flag being posted everywhere right after trump got elected. It was 100% clear that war mongering and zionism would be the way of the future for Donald trump instantly after he got power, and its been 100% true.</div>
