Second censored comment, in response to the mod spreading misinformation: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cmbvkc04yadfq87/r-california%20COVID%20mask%20science%20censored%20004.pdf?dl=0

-

The mod continues to abuse their moderator position to spread COVID misinformation: https://archive.vn/9OEq7 - notice how the mod never cites any evidence for their claims. Called them out for it after they continued to do it and comment gets removed again: https://archive.vn/gAp6A 

-

This is Reddit Inc allowing a single person to abuse a moderator position to manipulate and lie to thousands of people (about a very serious and impactful subject no less), while silencing all scientific rebuttals/information. And this is extremely common. 

-

So many people on reddit would support the behavior of this mod, simply because redditors have only been exposed to extremely biased, manipulated coverage of COVID. Due in large part to behavior like this from moderators all over reddit. So it's a self-perpetuating phenomenon. Just like in China where so many genuinely support the Chinese government because all they've been exposed to is the information the government gives them/allows.

**PS**: 

Op-Ed: What Does 'Follow the Science' Mean, Anyway? https://archive.vn/G89X1 - "Credentialism is not science. Science is not dogmatic; it demands testable, falsifiable hypotheses. Science is not censoring. Science is not a popularity contest. Science is applying criticism impartially, equally, fairly."

‘Following the science’ is more complicated than we like to admit. Scientists aren’t robots but complicated, messy, biased humans — like the rest of us https://archive.vn/ZBtKX</div>

    <div class="md">Because they're incapable of understanding that they way they're voting is what's actively making things around them worse. So, they leave, vote for the same kinds of policies instead of surveying the political landscape and learning why things work how they do where they do. See: any major metropolitan area in a primarily red state, most notably Austin vs the rest of Texas.

Edit: also wanna add this is a complaint from even other liberals from, for example, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, the list goes on. The trope of "Californians are ruining my state" is 100% a real thing.</div>

    <div class="md">The guy is going too deep into the trope IMO, but he does have a point about Californians, specifically. We fucking suck. I mean, most of us are ordinary whatever types, but the LA/SF people have lived in a bubble for *decades*. You can drive literally two hours away from LA and be in cow/farm country that any Texan could (and often do!) call home and none of these people are even aware of its existence. Once you get over the Grapevine and pour into Valencia, things change. For the worse. Everyone hates each other, and its one big game of "how long can we act like everything is going great before shit *really* hits the fan?" 

Point being: While expat Californians will be more liberal on average, I don't think the trope of them being an IV injection of DNC into a state is very honest. Yeah, they turn the cities blue, because cities are the only place the actual DNC-nutjob types can survive: "what do you mean there isn't a Starbucks in walking distance? Lets go back to Austin..." The rest, the rational, are moving into towns and breathing a sigh of relief that they can tie their own shoes without a permit from the town comptroller.</div>

    <div class="md">This state really has an unhealthy covid fetish. It starts at the top with Gov. Nuisance and his crayon coloring of lockdown zones.

Same is true of /r/santacruz  
They love to use covid as a way to bolster "localism" and keep public properties off limits from anyone who doesn't live there. They want highway checkpoints for people to "show der papaz!" to allow entrance to the entire county. (And don't realize they are replicating nazi practices in the meanwhile).   
Even Rep Ro Khana was facebook posting huge lies about an 8 hour wait for ambulances in Santa Clara hospitals and of course 'lines around the block' for ICUs.</div>
