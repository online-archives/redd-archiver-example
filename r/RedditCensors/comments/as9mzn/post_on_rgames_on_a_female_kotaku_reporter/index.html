    <div class="md">&gt; the company behind League of Legends, Lacy made it her mission to hire a woman into a leadership role. 

lol fuck 2019.  Literally unironically talking about sexism.

&gt;“Across the board, you’d have side-by-side similar backgrounds,” said Lacy, which is not her real name, “but the leadership team would constantly ixnay any female candidate for leadership.” 

lol WTF are "similar backgrounds", I notice how the words qualifications or job skills, or experience are definitely not mentioned..


&gt;Hiring a woman into a leadership position proved impossible for Lacy, she said, and she left the company in part because of the sexism she’d personally experienced

the sexism outlined in this sentence that she personally carried out... or.. different sexism..?

&gt; presented exactly as I did and the whole room was like, ‘Oh my gosh, this is amazing.’ [His] face turned beet red and he had tears in his eyes,” said Lacy. “They just didn’t respect women.

ree sexism, someone has better presence and elocution than me.  This is actually pathetic "my first job" shit. this is "journalism"?</div>

    <div class="md">Yep. And the SJW pandering means it wins an award because actual quality is no longer relevant. It's all about who's the biggest SJW. Why do you think PewDiePie is never in YouTube rewind anymore, despite being the biggest YouTuber in the world? Not to mention YouTube rewind itself.

Yep, fuck 2019.</div>
