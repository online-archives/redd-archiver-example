    <div class="md">Hey /r/WorldNews mods, why is this comment allowed?

&gt;Fuck the right wing and all those who enable them. This is a direct result of the normalisation of White Supremacy and White Nationalism. Thoughts are with the victims.

That's from the thread on the New Zealand terrorist attack. 

Why is this comment not allowed though?

&gt;It just begun, the holy war against the worlds true enemy - Islam

That's from the thread on the Utrecht terrorist attack. So it's ok to blame all white people for something, which is super racist, but it definitely isn't okay to blame all Muslims? </div>

    <div class="md">Nope, it definitely was his argument. His reaction to someone saying this:

&gt;"This is a direct result of the normalisation of White Supremacy and White Nationalism"

is this:

&gt;"So it's ok to blame all white people for something"

Which assumes that "the normalization of white supremacy and white nationalism" refers to "all white people". No mention of the media at all.</div>

    <div class="md">Very strange. Just tried it in Safari, which I don't use, so no addons, and it instantly came up.

I'm using Firefox with the above addons I mentioned.

Tried again with Firefox, but with those two disabled, and it still doesn't work.

Tried with Chrome, same deal as Safari, and it instantly came up as well.</div>

    <div class="md">If only that FUCKING RETARD Volkert Van Der Graaf hadn't killed Pim Fortuyn, maybe the Netherlands would be a safe place for Dutch people.

That motherfucker that killed him is now out there walking around free right now.

He only has to report for parole once every two months **by email**

This is how serious murders are treated in the Netherlands.

EDIT:
&gt; -Mosques in the city have been evacuated as a precaution. Schools remain on lockdown.

THEY EVACUATED THE MOSQUES. NOT THE NEARBY FUCKING DUTCH PEOPLE. MOSQUES. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!</div>
