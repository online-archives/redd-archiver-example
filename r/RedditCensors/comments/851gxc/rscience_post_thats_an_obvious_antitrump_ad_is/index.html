That thread is an obvious Shareblue troll.

    <div class="md">I do know what you mean. They remove top level comments because they have strict rules on the fact that top level comments have to be high quality, scientific, professional comments from someone who knows what they're talking about.

That's why I mentioned in my post that it was amazing they didn't delete the thread. It's not science. But it makes Trump look bad so they not only let it stay, but they removed any comments pointing out the utter hypocrisy of the whole thing. Anything to get in to that Trump bashing circlejerk. </div>
