    <div class="md">Do not link directly to reddit; it can lead to brigading, and if you are trying to show removed comments other users will not be able to view them. Instead, use ceddit.com to link to removed comments/submissions, or archive.is to link to reddit threads (for example, to show a moderator abusing his role). Alternatively you can also post screenshots.
