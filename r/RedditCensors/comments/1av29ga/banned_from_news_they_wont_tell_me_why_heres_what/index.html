    <div class="md">I was banned from there for (I think) asking why illegal immigrants enter the US illegally if they are asylum seekers, and why do they not go through the ports of entry. I don’t actually know why, because I got no response when I asked. They don’t even try to hide the censorship anymore. Only establishment supported opinions are allowed. 

This site is cooked. It has completely gone to shit. I’m unsubbing from everywhere but the few niche subs related to my hobbies. Anything slightly related to politics/social stuff does nothing but piss me off and bring back energy into my mind. On top of dealing with the censorship from these commie ass mods. Not worth it anymore. </div>
