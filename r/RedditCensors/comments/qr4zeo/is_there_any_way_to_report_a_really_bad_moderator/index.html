    <div class="md">U/Biondini is one ...got butthurt when I posted FACTS people I personally knew happened to through my WIFE who has 30 years in the banking industry. Was insulted repeatedly by that loser and other individuals who dis NOT have their Posts removed 
So clearly r/ Legal advice has a high school student as a moderator because it's run exactly like that ...

I was threatened and insulted by that moderator for posting you CAN get in big trouble for APPEARING to be structuring deposits.

I know several people who were fired from the banking industry for that . NONE were ever charged of a crime...but none can ever work in the financial sector again.

I knew all of them well enough to know the truth.

Something that moderator has absolutely no clue about.

I am banned from that group because of a PMsing high school student. Reddit is even more retarded than Facebook in some ways and in some groups.</div>
