&gt; 
&gt; Refrain from posting jokes, memes, puns, reaction gifs and wordplays. Comments should contribute to thoughtful and serious discussion only. Do not make light of events using humor. This subreddit exists to study and mourn.

Sounds like OP completely missed the point of the sub, made a cringy joke in poor taste, and is now salty that he got told to fuck off.

If the mods allowed shit like that, /r/morbidreality would have been purged alongside subs like /r/watchpeopledie</div>

    <div class="md">The main reason I visit that sub is because it is tasteful and not obscene like every other dark subreddit (which I won't bother visiting). There's a line between appreciating the darker half of life and the undignified foolishness people get up to. At morbidreality they have awareness of that line, which makes it possible for people with normal sensibility to go there.

Places that make a joke of suffering and death have people who call everyone who doesn't soft or sensitive, but fail to realize that they are the aberrant ones, the ones who should be ostracized. It's upside-down world for them. They are missing something in their personality. 

People who like to trigger others with these topics are like someone who doesn't have a sense of smell and so walks around with crap in their pants, and laughs at everyone who is disgusted by it.</div>
