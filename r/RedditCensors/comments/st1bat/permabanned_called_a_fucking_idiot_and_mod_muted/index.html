I piped up saying it also is supposed to make your cum taste good and have been permabanned, got a message from the mods calling me a “Fucking idiot” and then put on mute when I tried to ask why they saw this as ban worthy let alone insulting me. 

The fact is it DOES improve your …flavour and for people in a relationship it might be an interesting thing to know. I thought while not dead serious it was still on topic. Now I’m banned from a sub I enjoyed participating in and can’t even state my case. Unbelievable.

EDIT!  
I just this moment got an auto mod message from general Reddit saying my response to the mod was flagged as abusive! Fucks sake these guys are insane with power. I had made no further attempts to contact them after my mute since there was no point. 

Original message thread went him calling a “fucking idiot”. Me asking what it was I’d done to deserve that language or the ban. Was then told to look at my comment history and that I was a “fucking idiot” again before being muted for 30 days. NOW it’s ME getting a message about abusing mods????

Is there someone I can actually complain about this bullshit to? It’s not on.</div>

I’ve found an official channel to take it higher up. Not because of the initial issue but for now being reported for being abusive when I was told I was a fucking idiot on 2 occasions before being muted. It’s bullshit and I won’t stand for that. 

I’m damned sure I’m going to engage with this fucker now. Screenshots and all.</div>

    <div class="md">I disagree for the most part because I find commercial pizza sauces to typically be on the sweet side of things. So having a regular deliverable chain pizza with pineapple and probably a soda to drink along side it is typically sweetness overload for me. I might as well be eating dessert instead.

The caveat is that I can change up the balance of the pizza with the use of different toppings or sauces. It might not sound that appetizing, but if I'm really feeling like having pineapple on pizza and I'm ordering from somewhere that hasn't thought this stuff out, then a cream sauce, garlic, something spicy, and a combination of meats saltier than just ham is the easiest combination I can think of to counter the sweetness and tartness of pineapple. I don't mind its sweetness, but I just want a side note of it, and not want sweet to dominate my palate.</div>
