    <div class="md">People are upset that this keeps happening. They want it to stop and they think it won't until we stop ignoring that it's Muslim extremists and that religion just can't mesh with Western society. Why won't the mods let that be heard? What's the harm in allowing the discussion? Aren't you just supposed to be the news? Why do you allow such blatant talk of how white a guy in a van is, but not a peep of EVERY MUSLIM ATTACKER? 

I don't get it. What happened? Aren't we all as humans interested in survival? </div>

    <div class="md">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics

Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics."[1]


It is a system designed to counter russian shills.</div>

Facts like the one that the vast majority of Muslims aren't terrorists? If anything, those idiots pretending Muslims are to be blamed in general are helping ISIS with their narrative.

There are around 2bn Muslims, so if you somehow pretend the actions of a minority subset reflects on all of them...well...you're a bit of a retard.

And I know this will get downvoted from the "buhuuuu, let us be racist cunts" crowd...but I also wasn't sad when Coontown left.</div>

    <div class="md">maybe they're mistaking the fact that the faith allows and encourages the behavior for "all muslims are terrorists"? The bible tells people to stone gays, but you dont see people stoning gays. The opinion of sharia law in muslim majority country's is 55% according to pew research. That means that 55% of the people in muslim majority country's support sharia being the standardized law. Sharia, if dont know, is the law set that allows people to preform honor killings, throw gays off of roofs, throw acid on adulterers, etc. My theorizing for the reason this is a problem with islam and not with christianity, is that followers of islam have more conviction when it comes to their religion. more of them are willing to follow their book word for word over christians following their book word for word.

Dont get me wrong, the terror aspect is a seperate issue, but they stem from the same problem. Islam is imcompatible with western values in its current state. We need islam 2.0, or it needs to die off.

EDIT: i realize i didnt post the link for the pew research, my bad. http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/26/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/ (sharia numbers are about 1/16th down the page)</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; maybe they're mistaking the fact that the faith allows and encourages the behavior for "all muslims are terrorists"? 

It doesn't...only a perverse interpretation does, just like all the WBC bullshit. Just like most Christians, most Muslims don't follow the fundamentalist interpretation. 

As for Sharia, there are a lot of different interpretations. 

Lastly, one thing we mustn't forget is the political climate in a lot of Muslim countries. They are often dictatorships where the leadership has struck a deal with fundamentalist religious leaders (Saudi is a great example of this)...which means the general population can't make a stand against what they say without risking death. 

It's easy for us to say "why don't they protest" sitting on a cushy sofa here in the West...not so much for them. Even speaking out against doctrine online can get you in serious trouble...just look at how many bloggers have been sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for example. 

There are millions of Muslims living in total peace in the West without causing any issues. Hell, if you look at the number of terrorism attacks in the US, you realise the majority aren't done by Muslims. 

The easiest argument proving why it's retarded to claim they are all a problem is that there are almost 2bn Muslims. If they really all were to blame or an issue, we'd be fucked. Also, I'd be dead...because I'm a 6ft blonde atheist who spent weeks in Saudi Arabia during Ramadan for work. I'm super open about being an atheist (yes, even in KSA), yet somehow I'm still alive and had many great dinners/lunches/parties with Muslims over there. 

The poll you linked isn't all that helpful. If you asked most Christians if the story of Noah is true they'd say yes...doesn't mean they're all insane enough to really believe this ;)

My main reason for being ok with censoring racists idiots isn't that I care about letting them speak...I have that view because their stupid uneducated ramblings are actually helping ISIS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxNJLkIkYQM

    <div class="md">"its retarded to claim they are all a problem"

when i clearly said thats not what im saying. What cant you understand about criticisms of an idea structure are not aimed at the people that follow that idea structure? Its absolutely ridiculous to me that i cant criticize an obviously superfluously flawed idealogy without someone saying "duh christians doe". christians arent killing others and themselves in the name of their religion. If they were, and i could find dozens of scriptures to back up that behavior, i would be saying the exact same thing about christianity. it doesnt reflect on the people that follow the idealogy, it reflects on the people that take those specific ideas seriously. The fact that you muddy the water by bringing in a false equivalence of "did noahs ark happen" and "is it okay to stone gay people" is absolutely mind blowing to me. a better question to christians would be: Do you think the raping and pillaging of cities in the name of god was right? if they answer yes, im goign to look at them the same as someone that would support sharia.
The fact that everyone cant just take a stand against the bad ideas in the worlds largest idea structure is just abhorant to me. Not all muslims of course, not even muslims in general, but YES. ISLAM.

EDIT: since you're inevitably going to come back with more "preverse interpretation" claims, http://www.answering-islam.org/Quran/Themes/jihad_passages.html, there are 164 full verses, in context, in the quran that are associated with jihad. yes, some are "spiritual, inner-self" jihad, but tell me how many of them justify/encourage inflicting harm on others in the name of Allah. Again, yes, its in the bible as well, but we dont see this with the bible, because theres more "casual christians" than casual muslims. Those muslims that you speak of, the peaceful, well-meaning people, are the same as those christians who cherry pick the bible for the nice fluffly parts. Nothing wrong with them.</div>

    <div class="md">You might wanna read up about Christian terrorism if you believe it's not a thing ;)

We have crazy people in the US too who want to introduce the death penalty for gays. 

You can't just make a statement saying Islam is bad in general when the majority of Muslims aren't an issue. Fundamentalism is the issue here...and sadly many Muslims don't exactly have a choice about voicing their opinion openly in that regard, unless they want to be beheaded.

    <div class="md">yeah but its not literally 99% of the population like afghanistan. Equating a small minority of fundamentalists wanting death to gays to the vast majority supporting executions for gays, and actually executing gays, is one of the stupidest things ive ever heard. And you're saying exactly what im saying. FUNDAMENTALISTS. the people taking the book literally, word for word. you cant just say "fundamentalists are the issue" and then think there isnt a problem with islam. If the fundamentals are that abhorant, why is that not a problem?

Im not saying there arent christian terrorists, but to say theyre as frequent or widespread of that of islam is just a bananas statement. you would have to have your pants on your head to even begin to believe that.

Saying Islam is bad in general is completely different from saying there are serious problems with the islamic idea structure. I cant even believe i have to explain this.</div>

    <div class="md">The fundamentals of christianity are JUST AS BAD as islam, however, FAR less people take the bible literally than those that take the quran literally. The stats show it. the vast majority of people in america are fine with gay people at the very least existing, yet the bible states they should be stoned to death. because people dont take the bible as literal too much these days. </div>

    <div class="md">I'm saying it depends on which country you talk about. If you talk about terrorism in Muslim majority countries, it's obvious that the majority will be Muslim. 

In the US, most terrorists are Christian...because the majority religion is Christianity. Doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to understand why this is.

And again, speaking out against doctrine in many Muslim countries can get you killed...so if someone interviews you and asks about some fundamentalist aspect, guess what the answer will be given a "bad" answer could get you killed.</div>

    <div class="md">Please name me one terrorist that praised god as he did the action, or said he was doing it in the name of god. When you do that, i'll name you 10 islamic terrorists in the past year. Im not speaking of just the US, im speaking of the entire world. so whats happening in britain? the majority religion is christianity, yet islamic attacks are beginning to be a monthly event.
and to your effect of saying "speaking out against the doctrine can get you killed", i agree. BUT. what about country's like malaysia where sharia is not the legal system, yet polling shows that 86% of muslims are in support of it being the legal system. Your logic isnt adding up, my dude.</div>

    <div class="md">You are totally ignoring the fact that most attacks happen in warzones...and the majority of those are in Muslim countries. So if you use logic just once, you should realise that's the reason. 

In the west, only a tiny minority of attacks are done by Muslims...because they aren't Muslim countries suffering from wars.

Do you understand why the majority of attacks in Muslim countries suffering from wars are committed by Muslims...or do I need to do an ELI5 version for you? 

Also, google Christian terrorism to find lists of attacks...they are more common than you think ;)</div>

    <div class="md">yes, 8 attacks in the span of a little over a month in Britain. i guess britain is a warzone. ALL OF THESE attacks were associated with islam because of the perpetrator praising islam, praising allah, etc.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_terrorism#United_States
no, theyre about exactly as common as i would think. 1 maybe 2 every 2 or 3 years. thats not even comparable to the amount of islamic terror we've experienced in the west. (western society, not just america)

So your logic still isnt adding up, bud. Sorry, but this isnt really something ill be changed on. Islam needs reformation, or the war that isis so desperately wants between the west, and islam, is going to happen.</div>

    <div class="md">**Christian terrorism: United States**

Contemporary American Christian terrorism can be motivated by a violent desire to implement a Reconstructionist or Dominionist ideology. Dominion Theology insists that Christians are called by God to (re)build society on Christian values to subjugate the earth and establish dominion over all things, as a prerequisite for the second coming of Christ. Political violence motivated by dominion theology is a violent extension of the desire to impose a select version of Christianity on other Christians, as well as on non-Christians. At least 11 people have been killed in attacks on abortion clinics in the United States since 1993.

    <div class="md">Because you can't just pretend the interpretation and actions of terrorists is reflective of the entire population or religion. Last I checked Muslims over here follow the law and aren't stoning people. And of course there's a difference between ideas (which everyone can have freely) and acting on them.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude, i just spent an hour, with multiple links, multiple sources, one directly from the quran, and you're still harping on the same bullshit. 
here, does this help?
THE ACTIONS OF TERRORISTS DO NOT REFLECT ON THE 2.1BILLION MUSLIMS IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND FEELINGS.
There. is that better? now can we get back to the point that islam has had no reformation, and thats the problem here?</div>

    <div class="md">Because quotes from the quran are useless, just like bible quotes...because unless we're talking about terrorists or dictatorships, people aren't acting on those things...just like most Christians cherry pick stuff form the bible ignoring and not acting on the ugly stuff in the bible.

The problem isn't just Islam, it's how intertwined it is with dictatorships and how they are using it as a tool to stay in power. What needs to happen is a separation of church and state in those countries...because it's the same thing ensuring we don't have that bullshit over here with Christianity. </div>

    <div class="md">and when 80% of the population supports the church and the state being intertwined? christianity has had its reformation. thats why you hear people say "oh thats the old testament, not the new testament". faulty logic, but it sure did stop the crusades. Even imams are calling for reformation, and some jihadi sympathizers online are like "nuh uh! the muslims can never have an issue! we're so flawed and theyre so above us".
If the question was "does the christian idea structure allow for x" bible verses ABSOLUTELY would be relevant. we're talking about what the quran encourages, and the large amount of people that are fine with adhearing to it. You are the most non-sequiter loving person i've ever met. Follow the idea to the finish. The original point that i made. was. There is a problem with islam and violence. it is encouraged in the quran. it is ALSO encouraged in the bible, yet the bible had J Chreezy die on the cross and teach peace. the new testament wasnt added until far later. Christianity. has had. reformation. islam. has not had. reformation. the rate. of violence. in islam. is higher. what. is the difference. between. these two? reformation. without ANYTHING else. please explain to me why islam does not need a reformation.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, i get that. and the population of many of those countries agree. Like i said, there is rebellions in just about every one of those country's we're referring to. The people that disagree are there fighting. the people that want it as it is, i would assume, are not fighting. You'll notice that some country's rebellions are larger than others. take my logic and apply it to that. Obviously, more people in that country want to live free from that sort of thing, than in a comparable country with a smaller rebellion. Thats how my brain would process that, anyways.</div>

It's not just a matter of whether people want to make a stand or not...a lot depends on how powerful those dictatorships are. 

In KSA you don't see any revolt at all because they have an iron grip on everyone. There are a ton of beheadings for anyone even speaking up too openly. If they don't like you, they just charge you with witchcraft and you die. 

They're also incredibly wealthy and (thanks to US support) well armed. Not sure if you've been there, but if you had you'd know the average citizen would stand no chance fighting the current regime. It would be like a caveman fighting an aircraft carrier. Look at how ruthlessly KSA operates in Yemen against civilians. 

Or Syria for example...look at how hard it is to overthrow a damn dictator who's ruthless. 

Plenty of people disagree with the regime and fundamentalism (there are several "I want out" threads on Reddit), but also realise the odds stacked against them.

Sadly in today's world it's not just a numbers game, military tech plays a huge role as does foreign intervention. KSA's regime is propped up by the US for example...so if someone makes a stand against the regime, that regime will brand them as terrorists and the US will go along with it. 

It's easy to argue for revolution while sitting on a sofa reading Reddit...</div>

    <div class="md">There comes a line of "i will die fighting for this", and its reserved for the most serious of things. for example: i will die fighting for my right to freedom of speech. If tomorrow, north korea took over america, and instilled the same laws they have over there, i, and an extreme amount of others in my life, would not stand for it. We would fight until we either won, or were dead. If you look at something as paramount as your right to live freely as "meh, we wont be able to", you really dont care about the cause that much. There are gun runners all over the world. the citizens living in syria that want to fight ARE FIGHTING. they persisted, and the rebel forces are certainly to be reckoned with. It seems to me that your solution to increasing terror attacks is to do absolutely nothing. not even have a conversation about what could be done to prevent this in the future. Every single thing i throw at you of why this is happening, you're insisting that we can do absolutely nothing to stop it. I hate to break it to you, buddy, but while we've all been squabbling about refugees, and how many to take, poland is sitting in a big fat 0, and a count of terroist attacks that matches it perfectly. I guess thats a coincidence. I guess its also a coincidence that sweeden and the uk are getting the worst of it, and they imported more of this idea structure than anywhere. Is it coincidence, or fake news?

The bottom line is islam in its current state is incompatible with western culture. It just is. Before people are brought into a country, they need to be properly investigated of their views on western morality.
You may ask why bring refugees into the discussion, but its all linked. all of this is dependent on each other with the end result being "islam is not compatible with the ideals of western society.". The ONLY reason i say this is because of a lack of reformation. we dont need to screen christians because of the lack of people that read the old testament and say "fuck jesus, this is where its at, lets stone some gays". The new and old testament are very incompatible, and people will 99% of the time choose jesus because of the peace message. There is no jesus in islam. </div>

    <div class="md">I'm just trying to use a long term approach to the whole ME mess. 

Islam has already started going through a reformation...but at different speeds depending on country. If you grow up in a country with a ruthless dictator and censorship to the point where you can't develop a different viewpoint than your nut job leaders...reformation will take ages or is impossible. One example of that is our amazing ally Saudi Arabia. Where did the majority of 9/11 highjackers come from? ;)

If you live in a Muslim country with more open leadership and less censorship, reformation happens quicker. 

So if our goal is to make that reformation happen quicker, building walls or lumping together the majority of innocent &amp; harmless Muslims with the crazy ones isn't productive. Propping up dictatorships won't help either...Saudi Arabia, case and point. 

What will help is encouraging relationships and openness. That's how you support the majority of harmless people. It won't stop the crazy ones, but it will totally rob the crazy ones of all support from local governments or the public. 

Christianity went through this. Judaism did too. In countries with those religions, people generally had less censorship and good access to information...so reformation could happen. If someone tells you evolution is a hoax in the US, you can go online and look it up on Wikipedia or watch a Youtube video. In some ME countries, stuff like that is blocked or people simply have no way to get that info.

But if you grow up in such conditions, you shouldn't be grouped together with terrorists if you haven't done anything wrong. The only winners are groups like ISIS if we do that. If we tell those innocent people they are dangerous, where do you think they'll run to...ISIS. 

To ensure everyone looks at fundamentalist idiots like we look at WBC, we have to break down barriers and have open dialogues. The whole "OMFG Muslims are dangerous" approach is nothing but a great recruitment tool for ISIS :/</div>

    <div class="md">You're right on a lot there, but i still feel like you're painting me with a brush of being afraid of, or hate muslims. i feel no such thing. i have just as many gripes as i do about christianity, i just recognize the difference of reformation, which what i didnt know, is how they would go about doing it, which you and /u/_elemetnist have helped with. We have a lot of work to do before this problem is put to rest, though, i still dont know how to think of going about doing it. Integration is one problem that comes to mind with immigration, especially when we're talking about a scale like this, and we cant very well just walk in and give them education without a ton of problems arising. I guess we all just keep spitballing until something sticks</div>

    <div class="md">When it comes to immigration, soooo many fail :(

I'm Swiss and when I was born, people were ranting about Italians...who integrated well. Then Turks...who also integrated. As I got older, a lot of people ranted about people from Jugoslavia and Kosovo. Or people from Africa. But if I go to the shop back home now, the chap's name at the cashier might be Dragan Pavlovic...not exactly the most Swiss name. But they speak Swiss German/French and had a way to integrate (good school system), in many cases even if they were too old for regular school. Stuff like free language classes or education in general. If you don't offer them a way to catch up quickly and get decent jobs, things are bound to fail. It's how you create ghettos and closed communities. 

This happens even quicker if the local population treats them a bit like outcasts or a "danger". 

So yeah, more focus on integration policies are needed...</div>

    <div class="md">The reason christian extremists who believe in executing gays aren't more of a threat, is because they live in a society that is incompatible with their views. Muslims living in the states experience the same thing.

The middle east is in a period of economic and political instability, which has led to civil unrest and revolt. If you'll remember, the Arab Spring actually began as a secular and democratic movement, until it was hijacked by religious fundamentalists who wanted to take advantage of all the power transitions.

This is a big reason for why terrorism is primarily committed under the name of Islam. It would be interesting to see what would happen if similar circumstances occurred in a part of the world that wasn't primarily muslim. For example if something like that happened in the US (unlikely, due to our stable political structure, strong economy, etc.) and a small group of christian fundamentalists took over, I think you'd be surprised how large a portion of the population would be ok with that, or at the very least not do anything explicit to prevent that. 

All religions are somewhat outdated in their beliefs, as social and cultural shifts occur more frequently and quickly than religions can adapt and be ok with them. Islam is "behind the ball", because of the lack of the "enlightenment" period that many other major religions experienced at some point or another. Make no mistake though, christianity, hinduism, and others have all believed and enforced disgusting practices at some point or another, but look at where they are today.

    <div class="md">thats literally all ive been trying to say. The links and statistics are just to show that there IS a problem. my suggestion of solution is in line with what some imams are now saying, in that, islam is in desperate need of a "PR makeover". in a religion, thats a reformation. If the majority of people dont agree with the horrible things in the book, why not make an "addendum" (IE. New testament) to correct it?

    <div class="md">For sure. I don't disagree with you, but saying 99% of the Afghanistan population is as bad as the people who want to execute gays here isn't helpful in that endeavor. Unfortunately, a lot of people say they want "reform", but that is just masking an extreme prejudice and even hate against muslims. Probably why you see so much hateful rhetoric when this issue is discussed.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; The opinion of sharia law in muslim majority country's is 55% according to pew research. That means that 55% of the people in muslim majority country's support sharia being the standardized law

Well that has to be placed into context, because its very specific to the country, which is also very specific to the local history and geopolitical situation they are in now.

&gt; Responses on this question vary widely. Nearly all Muslims in Afghanistan (99%) and most in Iraq (91%) and Pakistan (84%) support sharia law as official law. But in some other countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia – including Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%) and Azerbaijan (8%) – relatively few favor the implementation of sharia law.

So to add context countries that have experienced more recent war, destabilization, and major economic issues are more likely to be run by orthodox religious groups. These are areas with little to no education, and those groups often come in power representing the local culture and religion against a foreign enemy that quickly becomes the face of all of the local problems, however accurate that viewpoint is, it quickly entrenches the religious party in power, and often results in harsh attacks on education and media while pushing state religion etc...

Now history teaches us that the majority 'barbaric' practices we currently have issues with were also widespread in Christianity as well. The argument is usually "we don't do that anymore but they do, they're so backwards", but you have to understand why/when christians abandoned those practices and why those conditions haven't happened often in the middle east.

The success of the european powers at colonizing the world for a period of time had a large impact on domestic european life. While there certainly were several large wars in europe, they happened between powers that were increasingly growing more stable and secure in their power and scope of economic activity, and the wars increasingly happened in remote colonies (see the rise of netherlands, spain and portugal as world powers, eventually the french and then the british would come along and take it from them, while still leaving them relatively large and secure as countries in europe). While that is a fairly large oversimplification of several centuries of world history, the point is the average person had increasingly longer and more stable lives. You could live as part of a single country, ruled by a single family, have property ownership across multiple generations (ignoring the occasional swapping of cousins as king/queen), and increasingly those that weren't the upper class had leisure time and money (this was a fairly slow progression for most of the period, with intermittent spikes, but it was still a shift with a clear direction over several hundred years). As mercantilism grew and the business class increasingly took power, education went up, and religious control decreased. The infighting of the church (Church of england breaking off from the catholic church, before that the number of anti-popes etc...) also played a large part, especially when the monarchy increasingly cared less about religion, and would with the right money or political pressure change the national religion of a country. The entire period is somewhat hilariously called "enlightenment", but the end results was due to peace and education an overall secularization of society. The less religious the society, the more difficult it is to convince them to partake in barbaric and questionable religious restrictions that have little benefit or point other than punishing someone for angering "god". This came to a head with the formation of the US with strong separation of church and state laws (we'll get back to that in a minute)

Now go back to the middle east. The ottoman empire was arguably the closest they came historically to forming a unified, peaceful and growing (sunni) muslim society, and that was still plagued by regional/tribal warlords causing rifts and instigating violence, as well as inter-faith conflicts against the conflicting shia muslims farther east. They never reached the level of growth, national unity or progress european christian countries did, largely because the greater stability europe experienced never happened in the middle east. The increasing rise of european colonization in the middle east and africa futher increased the instability, and the controlling and barbaric practices of colonization further entrenched Muslims in their religion. With the fall of the ottoman empire the majority of the arab world has fallen under european control as recently as 90-150 years ago. That control was exploitative, combatative, and religiously repressive. Those actions only further entrenched people in their religion and culture, and further pushed the perception (which was very much true at the time) that this was a christian vs muslim fight for the world.

Now the last 100 years has been the fall of european colonialism, and the clusterfuck left behind culturally, economically and politically. This is on top of a region and culture that has more or less never had the ability to self-rule for any period of peace long enough to encounter enlightenment or secularization of their society. The end result of that is a society ruled by religion, run by controlling information and knowledge, that hardens its resistance against secularization by contrasting itself against the west and using the mistakes and flaws of the west (and a whole lot of propaganda).

A great example of what could have been is Iran. Due to geography, they managed a longer period of peace, and as a society started going through their own renaissance and enlightenment phases. Religious restrictions like alcohol, clothing, language, education were all being relaxed. Then a western country came in, played political games, destabilized the region and then left the orthodox religious who represented the clear "opposite" of the American/Western powers that were fucking with their country, and thus quickly gained popularity and power. Once in power, those religious restrictions came back, and any progress/enlightenment that country had experienced was quickly reversed.

So yes, areas that have been constant hotbeds of unstable fighting, colonialism, the fall of european colonialism, the constant foreign interference and attempts to control their countries and natural resources, are going to be unstable, and that instability is going to lead to various groups fighting for themselves, and when the conflict has been drawn across religious lines for so long, people will harden in their beliefs and refuse to accept or listen to arguments otherwise. These areas worldwide are prone to conflict, terrorism, regional warlords and groups taking power (taliban, isis etc...).

So, back to the question. Is it a Muslim problem? No, its a problem that largely impacts the muslim world today, but the roots of the problem trace back to geopolitical history that isn't specific to their religion but their geography and historical events as well as inter-religious fighting.</div>

    <div class="md">You're correct in the assertion that its geopolitically related, but you have yet to touch on the point i'm adamant about. While Christianity has the same horrible things as Islam embedded in it, Islam has had no reformation. When you have something has antiquated as these two idea structures, and nothing changes, you end up with people thinking some antiquated things, like its okay, encouraged, and actually holy to kill gay people and adulterers. 
You're obviously more educated on the matter. I can admit a lesser understanding when its apparent. But what ive been saying is that, for example, ISIS, is not "perverting an interpretation", theyre doing things that are word for word in the book. If the KKK was running around doing this shit, i would be saying the same thing. but they arent. and i think its partly because of, here comes to special word of the day, reformation. Even the WBBC wont kill people, because in their words: "we are the watchers. we have been instructed by jesus to love our neighbor, and we love through saving.". There is no Jesus in islam, there is Muhammad, a man that conquered, enslaved, raped, and pillaged his way to the top of the middle eastern "food chain".

So in short, im not going to disagree with anything you said, however, im going to add my point in as a caveat to your conclusion, unless you would like to extrapolate further on the idealogical front.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;but you have yet to touch on the point i'm adamant about. While Christianity has the same horrible things as Islam embedded in it, Islam has had no reformation

That was a central part of my post, so I'm not sure how I didn't touch on that, so let me try again

Due to relative peace and prosperity, and the ability to self rule (christians ruling christians), over centuries, the stability in europe (relatively speaking here) led to increases in education which led to the secularization of the european culture. 

The Muslim world has basically not had that as of yet. The times they did have a semblance of control and rule, they were faced with large wars against foreign players. That prevented them from ever truly stabilizing to the point that their society would no longer have a 'crucible' in the form of a invading foreign religion to continually temper and inflame itself. This has led to religious supremacy and control in the middle east as much as other things.

The reason the muslim world has not had that is largely due to the actions of the european players historically, up until WWII and shortly after. The destabilization of colonial rule coming in, failing, then leaving is almost impossible to quantify, and could take centuries to overcome.

&gt; If the KKK was running around doing this shit, i would be saying the same thing. but they arent. 

But they were at one point. The death penalty, killing "witches", killing gay people. Don't forget slavery was justified using the bible for a long time. 

Pretty much every issue we have with the Koran also exists in the Jewish Tanach, which means it also exists in the Christian Bible. All the barbaric practices in those religion actually come from the semitic cultures those religions grew out of, which is why they are so similar. All the barbaric practices the Muslims have now exist in both Judaism and Christianity historically.

So the question comes down to "Why do the Jews and the Christians not practice these commands while the Muslims do". The answer is that if you go to truly orthodox jewish or christian communities, they still want to follow those commands but they aren't allowed because they exist in a secular society. Russia still jails gay people among many other heinous things due to a strong orthodox christian background. The biggest risk of "sharia" law coming to the US is from the christian right wing constantly attacking separation of church and state and trying to implement their religious ideology as law. The vast majority of society however is not orthodox, largely because of european enlightenment, which applied to the Jews as well due to other historically complex and semi-related events I'm not going into here.

So back to the point. Christians don't "not do this because of Jesus", christians DID this already long after it was formed and Jesus was dead. The reason Christians and Jews don't act like this now is because of a secularization of society due to increasing education/enlightenment caused by peace and prosperity.

The middle east hasn't had decades, let alone centuries of local peace and prosperity, so there has been no increase in education that leads to enlightenment, thus no secularization of their society, thus no reformation.

tl;dr Christians didn't "reform" because of their religion, but because of the secularization of society and an increase in education and knowledge outside the church. The Middle East and much of Muslim Africa has not had the time to reform due to european colonialism, as well as the Muslim vs Christian wars/crusades before that, as well as the fractured nature of the tribal culture they retain that was left behind in europe due to successful conquest. That tribal nature still exists for many Jews and Arabs and is the root of many of the problems we still face along with the historical/geopolitical influences.

    <div class="md">Basically that's the case. The middle east isn't going to be "solved" by europe or america. The only way its going to become stable is if it finds its own equilibrium and decides to build on that stability, which you can't force them to do. As long as we continue interfering in the middle east for oil, they will never reach any sort of equilibrium, and the tension between the religions and societies will never have time to cool off.

Honestly, immigration is the worlds best bet in my opinion, but they have to make sure they learn from the mistakes of past generations. 

First generation immigration is usually great, but due to racism, systemic issues and poverty second generation immigrants are at significant risk of radicalization and violence. Immigrants have to be accepted, and given a path to succeed in your country. Europe and North America has worked for a long time with what is essentially a 'permanent' underclass of immigrants or people of foreign descent, the current black problems I think have a lot to do with that (but I know much less about that than this subject honestly), and as long as you have that underclass with limited social mobility out of it (something that is getting worse, not better, in the US) then you're at risk.

Currently there are muslim populations all over the world, I would say about 20-30% of them are actively secularizing now. Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan are examples, and we had absolutely nothing to do with them and they were somewhat sheltered from the worst of colonialism and the religious wars before that in comparison. 

The problem for the rest is (in my mind), as long as the west exists as a crucible to harden their beliefs against, they will not change. The west has to turn itself from a direct enemy to a distant non-significant entity so the social consciousness can focus inwards and slowly start to improve itself.  

At the end of the day, leaving them to their own devices, and focusing on making sure that the immigrants in our countries are given the opportunity and support needed to succeed and settle in, as well as making sure that they are appropriate defensive steps in place to keep the extremists and terrorists out, is the best strategy. </div>

    <div class="md">i completely agree, yet what about integration? Is whats happening in europe not a clash of fundamental world views? what i mean by "happening in europe" is the rape rate in sweeden, germany, and the uk skyrocketing, unemployed masses of refugees in Sweden, not skilled enough to fill the positions available, etc. Like do we just throw money at them, try to re-educate them, and hope it works? for children, it WILL work. But im not so positive thinking when it comes to the adults. people are super stubborn everywhere.</div>

    <div class="md">Integration is difficult, but that is a difficult problem. I'm not sure I have the solution.

&gt;the rape rate in sweeden, germany, and the uk skyrocketing

That has been explained over an over again as having nothing to do with immigration or Muslims. tldr changes in how rape is reported and tried have caused significant increases in the stats, not racial or immigration issues.

&gt;Unemployed masses of refugees in Sweden, not skilled enough to fill the positions available, etc. Like do we just throw money at them, try to re-educate them, and hope it works? for children, it WILL work. But im not so positive thinking when it comes to the adults. people are super stubborn everywhere.

I think this is truly the problem. Where I live you don't get to immigrate unless you have a skillset and the ability to provide for yourself and your family, so this would apply mostly to refugees. For refugees, I do support paying for their education and holding them accountable to our laws. If they choose to integrate then citizenship should be an open path, but if they don't then they can't stay forever (3-5 year status or something. I don't know, this is a hugely complex issue)

Basically, if you need to pay for those coming in now so that 30-40-50 years from now they and their families are integrating and giving back to society, its a long term investment for the better.</div>

Not true! 94% of terrorist attacks in the US since 1980 have been committed by non-Muslims according to the FBI: https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005

&gt;That fact cannot be ignored.

    <div class="md">Gee buddy, if you're gonna cite sources, at least cite the most recent one. [Here's the 2008 analysis from the FBI.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/stats-services-publications-terror_08.pdf/view)

Pay particular attention to Chart 4 on slide 25 and Slide 13 and 14 under "Attackers" where it states that most of the terrorist attacks that year were conducted by Al Qa'ida. I wonder what religion Al Qa'ida subscribe to. *HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.*

In fact, if you want a run down of all the terrorist attacks in 2016, [go here.](https://storymaps.esri.com/stories/terrorist-attacks/?year=2016) Thankfully, the facts speak for themselves and we don't have to take your word for it.

    <div class="md">Yeah, and your report talks about attacks worldwide...in which case those attacks committed by Muslim terrorists mostly kill...wait for it...waaaaaaait for it...other Muslims. 

The majority of victims from Muslim terrorists are actually other Muslims...which again shows they aren't representative of the wider Muslim community.

Not an apologist, but someone who cares about logic and facts. Try it! Your attitude plays right into the hands of ISIS, congrats ;)</div>

    <div class="md">Because in the US it's CLEARLY not the case...and it should be obvious that given geopolitics the majority of attacks happen in Muslim countries given all the wars there. Look up which region of the planet suffers from the most wars right now to figure out why only an idiot wouldn't realize that's the reason most terrorist attacks worldwide are committed by Muslims. 

But again, even so, the majority of victims are also Muslims...so there's that. And you are desperately trying to lump those victims in with fundamentalist assholes...which exactly what ISIS wants you to do. 

So congrats for helping ISIS's narrative :/</div>

    <div class="md">At least I rewrote the same thing with some formatting changes. You did a 180 and completely changed, tone, stance and argument, lol.

But seeing as you can't respond to **the fact** the majority of terrorists aren't Muslim and are now going after my like of good formatting and dislike of the little edit star, I guess this is a clear win.

Laters, retard!</div>

    <div class="md">I'm back bitch! [The Internet never forgets.](https://prnt.sc/fmfans) Once you post garbage, the it will always be out there. And bro, that's one hell of a "typo".

For anyone else following this retards train of verbal diarrhea, here's the post he deleted.

&gt;Yeah, and your report talks about attacks worldwide...in which case those attacks committed by Muslim terrorists mostly kill...wait for it...waaaaaaait for it...other Muslims.
The majority of victims from Muslim terrorists are actually other Muslims...which again shows they aren't representative of the wider Muslim community.

&gt;Get the fuck out of here with your Muslim apologist attitude. (a quote from my previous post -QQ_L2P)

&gt;Not an apologist, but someone who cares about logic and facts. Try it! Your attitude plays right into the hands of ISIS, congrats ;)


And here's what he changed it to.

&gt;Because in the US it's CLEARLY not the case...and it should be obvious that given geopolitics the majority of attacks happen in Muslim countries given all the wars there. Look up which region of the planet suffers from the most wars right now to figure out why only an idiot wouldn't realize that's the reason most terrorist attacks worldwide are committed by Muslims.
But again, even so, the majority of victims are also Muslims...so there's that. And you are desperately trying to lump those victims in with fundamentalist assholes...which exactly what ISIS wants you to do.

&gt;So congrats for helping ISIS's narrative :/

I mean, he's clearly forgotten that there's an interactive map linked in my last post where he can see all the attacks in the US, and around the world for that matter. If he's actually like to look at facts, like he claims to, he can see who carried out the attacks in the US. But since interactive maps are hard for him, [I'll go ahead and link a wall of text.](https://www.infoplease.com/world/disasters/terrorist-attacks-us-or-against-americans) Should be more his speed.

So thankfully, this retard has demonstrated his inability to challenge **THE FACT** that the majority of terrorists are Muslim. I mean, he'll sit there and excuse it because "muh geopolitical rezuns", but stupid people don't know why they're stupid. And it's a fools errand to expect them to ever have that epiphany.</div>

And again, comical how you don't understand why the majority of attacks happen in warzones...and those are located mostly in Muslim countries right now. Your conclusion that this somehow allows racist cunts to group all Muslims together is both laughable and sad at the same time. Also makes it clear you don't really understand geopolitics ;)</div>

    <div class="md">Deleting it from the comment chain doesn't remove it from your post history you retarded cunt. And judging by the format that's where it came from. Find that post in this thread and screenshot it. Then you have a valid point.

When you import people with different values from a different environment, there's gonna be problems. I can sit and post for hours about how these radicals are fucking the West. You'll sit there and tell me it's a small minority. At the last Intelligence community reports,there were 1.2 billion Muslims. Of them, 25% are believed to be radical. 25% of 1.2 billion is 300 million, the same population as the US. Thats a Jihadi fighter for every man woman and child who would happily blow themselves up to kill you.

300 million. And you say they're not a problem, lol.  </div>

Still waiting for an answer on **the fact** most terrorists are Muslim. Because, let's not forget, you still haven't answered that one.

    <div class="md">&gt;the majority of attacks happen where all the wars are
 
And why are all the wars in Muslim majority countries, hmmm? 

&gt;Most of the victims are Muslims

And 99.9% of the attackers are Muslim, the victims have no bearing on the ideology promoting these actions, which is Islam, nearly ALL the time.

&gt;And you are desperately trying to lump those victims in with fundamentalist assholes.

If someone calls themselves a Muslim, they are knowingly placing themselves under the banner of a terrorist, jihadist ideology. I don't care what their *personal belief* about Islam is, the fact of the matter is that Jihad and forced conversion, establishment of an Islamic state, and putting the world under Sharia, are CORE tenants of Islam. That is a radical. All muslims are radical if they are real Muslims. 

So we are at a point where the "peaceful muslims" are not actually Muslims. The only way to mesh with peaceful society is to be a "moderate" muslim. This is synonymous with being an apostate, because you cannot criticize or change the word of God as dictated in the Quran. Muslim scholars agree on this, it is the absolute perfect word of God. To change or cherrypick is to blaspheme. 

Do you not see how so called "peaceful muslims" tacitly support and give power to the "radicals"? Whether by aiding and abbetting terrorists on the run, as they do daily in the UK and France, or by funneling funds through mosques to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah and Hamas? 

http://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/hezbollah-supporters-call-for-israels-annihilation-at-london-rally/

https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/148180-170618-controversial-al-quds-day-march-to-take-place-in-london

This is the "peaceful majority" of Muslims. calling for the annihilation of Israel.

Islam has a problem, and it's not a minority of followers that contribute to it, it's the majority. There are a small amount that wish to live in peace, pray 5 times a day, and go about their lives. But that's not the norm, and it's clear you've never been in a Muslim Majority country by the way you talk. The absolute vitriol you can hear in any conversation about Jews or Gays or Christians or the West, FROM ANYONE YOU MEET, in muslim countries, is disgusting. The radio is filled with stations advocating jewish genocide. The Tv stations for kids is full of brainwashing "pro caliphate" propoganda. Al Jazeera and other news stations report Palestine militants as brave war heros that were slaughtered by Israeli dogs during the good fight, when the reality is that they were shoved back and executed for shooting up a school library where Jewish 12-18 year olds were studying. 

This is not a dark underbelly of Islam, this is the mainstream thought process. And it's an easy proof, why are these radicals consistently voted into power by so called moderate populations? Could it be that "moderate muslims^^TM" actually agree with sharia and forced expansion/conversion of disbelievers, and are in support of genocide of jews, and the annihilation of Israel?

&gt;So congrats for helping ISIS's narrative :/

If you kill your enemies they win, eh? When will you start to believe what your enemies are telling you they want? How many thousands of bodies of westerners will appease your white guilt? Will it take another 9/11 to believe that these people mean what they say, when they tell you they want to establish a Muslim state worldwide? When they tell you "we cannot lose, we love death more than they love life"? 

Thought experiment for you: If tomorrow, all the Jews in Israel put down their weapons and said "we won't fight any more, do what you will", What would happen? I think you know what would happen, the jews would be annihilated completely, and, depending on if the Palestinian army considred the jewish women worth raping or not (since they're subhuman garbage, as they are called by muslims), might become slaves.

Contrasting this, if the Palestinians laid down their weapons, that area would finally have peace. 


Islam has a problem, and you're part of it by sitting here and defending an ideology that wants you, me, and a lot of other people to fucking die.

    <div class="md">Because in the US it's CLEARLY not the case...and it should be obvious that given geopolitics the majority of attacks happen in Muslim countries given all the wars there. Look up which region of the planet suffers from the most wars right now to figure out why only an idiot wouldn't realize that's the reason most terrorist attacks worldwide are committed by Muslims.

But again, even so, the majority of victims are also Muslims...so there's that. And you are desperately trying to lump those victims in with fundamentalist assholes...which exactly what ISIS wants you to do.

So congrats for helping ISIS's narrative :/</div>

    <div class="md">Two of the top comments do mention reports of "Allahu Akbar" being shouted:

&gt; "Het Laatste Nieuws tabloid newspaper quoted what it said were witnesses saying a man shouted "Allahu Akbar" in Arabic before a small explosion. Soldiers ran towards the spot, saw wires protruding from the man's clothes, and shot him. That account could not be independently confirmed."

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6ig8y3/brussels_train_station_evacuated_amid_unverified/dj5zkhp/

&gt; From Terror Events' twitter:      
&gt; Sources: 1 suitcase exploded. Military saw a man with wires around himself. Possible SBELT. Target neutralized. Apparently yelled Allah Akbar.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6ig8y3/brussels_train_station_evacuated_amid_unverified/dj5z3ox/

I'm quite confident this correction of the claim in the title will be censored from this subreddit one way or another, but maybe I'm proven wrong and this subreddit actually cares about accurate titles.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics
&gt; Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics."[1]




&gt; It is a system designed to counter russian shills.
