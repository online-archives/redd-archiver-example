Clearly the initial comment was criticising the White House's bungled response to covid-19 (delayed quarantines, misappropriation of PPE and ventilators, Trump's inconsistent and insane comments throughout this period) which has led to tens of thousands of deaths.

    <div class="md">Calling it "Chinese virus" is sinophobic and not innocuous. The disease came from China but using such rhetoric causes people to associate it with, and blame/ostracize/fear individuals who have nothing to do with it.

The comment was not innocuous.

Furthermore, I didnt call Trump "all powerful" - it's the White House's inaction, spreading of confusing, conflicting info and sometime straight up misinformation, and failure to adequately prepare for and contain the virus that has, in large part, lead to the state America has found itself in.</div>

🙄

&gt;West Nile Virus

&gt;Guinea Worm

&gt;Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

&gt;Lyme Disease

&gt;Ross River Fever

&gt;Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever

&gt;Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever

&gt;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

&gt;Valley Fever

&gt;Marbug Virus Diseasse

&gt;Norovirus

&gt;Zika Fever

&gt;Japanese Encephalitis

&gt;German Measles

&gt;Spanish Flu

&gt;Lassa Fever

&gt;Legionnaire's Disease

But yeah, "Chinese virus" is racist.

&gt;it's the White House's inaction, spreading of confusing, conflicting info and sometime straight up misinformation, and failure to adequately prepare for and contain the virus that has, in large part, lead to the state America has found itself in.

There's a worldwide pandemic - I guess the leaders all over the world are complete failures, huh?

[Even Sweden where they didn't even bother ordering a shutdown](https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-why-hasnt-sweden-gone-into-lockdown-over-covid-19-pandemic-11966132) - definitely awful, right?</div>

    <div class="md">A. Diseases like WNV and Spanish flu were named a long time ago; were they to be discovered now they would be named differently. 

B. Covid-19 already has a name; no medical body is calling it Chinese virus.

C. WNV is not not a pandemic, nor is it a contemporary anxiety. Nobody's beating up Egyptians in fear they have WNV. 

Calling coronavirus Chinese flu has real world implications on Chinese and other ethnically East Asian people. We have a name for it already, there is no need to make up new, racist ones.</div>

    <div class="md">A. MERS was discovered in 2012... But i don't care when it was named because I don't get offended over everything, most normal people don't either, you are probably from a far left area like New York or LA or some where that fragile people thrive, but most people don't think like that.

B. So does Spanish flu, H1N1. But I don't know why anyone should get offended either way. 

C. Who tf is beating up Chinese people? And if anyone is beating up Chinese people, why dont you just get mad at those people? The vast vast majority of people who say Chinese virus arent beating up Chinese people, so instead of getting angry at words, get angry at actions.

    <div class="md">&gt; I mean tens of thousands of people have died in the US.

Literally not what you said. You said, and I quote, "the White House's bungled response to covid-19...which has led to tens of thousands of deaths."

Come on man, just admit you're desperate to pin this on Trump but you know, for a fact, that he's done a decent job (criticism for his rambling and incoherence is fine, lying about his admin's response to the virus is not)

&gt; The US has objectively done a poorer job than many (if not most) other countries at containing the virus and distributing medical equipment despite having months to prepare.

This is objectively **false**. What, do you actually fucking believe China's and Russia's numbers? Again, how retarded are you?

&gt; So how can you argue it's not true?

Because its objectively false you fucking sheep.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Trump did create the virus? 

No.  The virus is a virus.  They occur naturally.  Nobody "created" it, it created itself.  

&gt; The virus is not Chinese? 

It is not.  The virus has no nationality.  Though speculation and early signs point to it having emerged first in an area in China, the virus itself has no nationality.  It has a name(Covid-19 or  SARS-CoV-2 or novel Coronavirus).  The majority of people already uses those names in liu of "Chinese virus" because that name is deliberately inflammatory, attempting to use language to pin the virus on the Chinese people and stoke anger and resentment towards the Chinese.  If you are using it because you would like to denote regionality, as we have seen with the Spanish flu or Zika Virus, it would probably be slightly more honest to call it the  Wuhan Coronavirus, though imo its still an unnecessary delineation.  The Chinese government is undeniably a totalitarian regime responsible for reprehensible crimes against humanity, but that is no reason to stoke a xenophobic mentality against Chinese people in general.</div>

    <div class="md">Appreciate the response.        
    
I disagree on several counts, but you have brought forward a perspective I haven't heard before.    
First point of disagreement would be on a virus having no nationality. Yes. A virus has no nation. It does have a place of origin. In this case the government that reigns over its place of origin responsible for the early mismanagement of the situation. Why should they not be held to account?    
    
Secondly I would like to shine a light on the hypocrisy. Many global originations, government and media outlets were happy to use terms like Zika virus, but are now coming up with arguments as to why naming a virus by country of origin is xenophobic/racist. It is easy to see how many in the public would concluded these organizations are simply capitulating to Chinese influence.    

Third, good and bad things come from all countries. It doesn't make it racist or device to acknowledge the country of origin. Most people are smart enough to differentiate between a nation and the individual residents. The assumption that they aren't is pretty patronizing. 
    
Last point. I do not like the CCP. The CPP is clearly bothered by the term Chinese Virus. If I see nothing wrong with the terms use and thought it would have any significant impact I would defs go out of my way to do some trolling.</div>

    <div class="md">You're a special kind of retard.

T_D is like the only sub on reddit that is pro-Trump, and the admins have basically neutered it completely. Every single prominent political sub censors conservatives and centrists. Reddit is basically a 24/7 far left woke faux-progressive circlejerk.

T_D started as and never stopped being a rally sub for Trump. That's literally what it was designed to be.

/r/politics on the other hand bills itself as neutral, which is just fucking laughable.

The fact that you think you've made a rational argument here makes you actually retarded. Like, your brain is fucking broken.</div>

    <div class="md">Well then you should ask yourself what the purpose/goal of entering the discussion with reasonable arguments is, if not too convince others. 

If you wanted to convince, you could have done better. If you wanted to just be mean, you also could have done better.

    <div class="md">It's not about what is just it's about results. While you may be right just soapboxing about how stupid everyone else is doesn't do a lot to move the needle you claim to be interested in moving. The real motive appears to be ego stroking, which like I said, you could have also done better.

I'm not advocating for niceness because it's nice. I'm trying to get you to better align your actions with your goals. 

I have been a militant atheist from a young age. It took me years to realize if I really wanted to open people's eyes, it was better to try to get them to the next step in their journey towards non belief instead of loling or even using heavy handed logic to get my point made. 

You don't have to seek to be nice, but I do ask you seek to be more effective, whatever your belief. Google pragmatism and try to shed some of that ego we all have. Only good things come from that. 

Good luck out there 👍</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; It's not about what is just it's about results.

I don't follow this at all. What is just is right, and a just person doesn't compromise their morals just so they can get results.

Not that I'm trying to be just. I'm trying to insult retards.

&gt; just soapboxing about how stupid everyone else is

That's not what I'm doing. I'm calling out an individual person for being stupid when they post stupid stuff. I feel like you're projecting here...

&gt; The real motive appears to be ego stroking

Okay, definitely projection because that's what you're doing here for sure. Think you are some righteous moral beacon for calling out my nastiness when in reality you're just sniffin' your own farts.

My motive is to piss in these people's cheerios. I'm trying to make their day worse. I want them to be angry; to feel insulted. Don't give a single fuck if I've changed their mind (nobody should change their mind because of some dumb conversation they have on reddit...)

&gt; Google pragmatism 

See, here it is. You retards always do this, and I know its on purpose. You act like you're being all soft and nice, "Just be friendly buddy! I'm here for you!" type shit then betray your opinion of me.

You think I'm too fucking dumb to know what pragmatism is. Poor little 'ol me is just so helpless and dumb that, without your benevolent guidance and knowledge, I'd be destitute. Its very similar to how leftists treat minorities: like they're helpless children that need a white savior to protect them from the evil evil racists.

Fuck you, and fuck off.</div>

    <div class="md">Fair points. 

I guess I just never believed people woke up with the sole motive to just dump on another group of people. Any time I have done that sort of thing, if I see it is schadenfreude or worse, I feel bad about it. I guess in that way, my moral compass is uncompromising as I do find it ugly to organize your motives around ruining people's day. 

Flabbergasted and disgusted you're well written and sensible but choose to carry yourself in the world that way. 

Thanks for the chat even if it didn't end well. Good to get some new "from the horses mouth" perspective.

E: and I'm sorry I hurt your feelings or betrayed how I presented myself with the let me Google that for you comment. I see it worked against my motive of getting you to be more pragmatic as we discussed earlier. Something to think about. 

Love you</div>

    <div class="md">I wouldn't say it's lying to choose your words and ideas. Think about a math teacher who simplifies a more complex idea so the students can understand and build upon it. Or a physics teacher not deep diving relativity before they understand Newton. 

You present yourself very differently every day to all different kinds of people. The way you would present the same idea to your boss, friends, parents, etc would all be different and often not include the same information. 

Is that immoral? If not, why not? Is it being aware of choosing your words -- the intent-- or something else?</div>

    <div class="md">Someone arguing that Trump is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people is just flat out lying. 

He's not a God, period.

Telling your wife the dress makes her look skinny when she's 200 pounds is a completely different scenario.

The intent in one case is to blame someone by spreading misinformation.

The intent in the second case is to make your wife feel better about the fact that she's a whale.

We forgive lies based on intent - trying to be nice is a forgivable lie in almost every society.</div>

    <div class="md">If you spoke with those people and listened you would see it's not a lie though. A lie has intent -- You may think it's the wrong interpretation but that doesn't make the other person a liar. You're likely disagreeing over foundational definitions like what responsible really means. 

Either way I didn't understand what you meant originally because I thought you were talking about the general idea of not being emotional and heavy handed when trying to persuade others, so my bad.</div>

    <div class="md">I thought you were the person who originally commented so my bad.

I get that you're just trying to say, "*Hey, there are better ways to be persuasive than being angry.*"

While you're not wrong, seeing the same lies repeated thousands of thousands of times and knowing you have one quiet voice that will be removed altogether as soon as you open your mouth gets a bit frustrating.

At a certain point people start throwing out emotional appeals because they work - sometimes seeing someone angry and passionate works (I mean just look at leftists ffs).</div>
