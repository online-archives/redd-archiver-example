    <div class="md">Source. I understand that, but don’t put me in the back of the classroom and authoritatively bully me into not asking questions. 

When I search original Hebrews, even on Reddit; there is no consensus answer. And it seems that the majority say that the Original Hebrews weren’t White. 

If this topic can lead to a people person like myself being called an antisemite; I want a source so I can better educate myself. 

If Jesus wasn’t White, and Cleopatra can be portrayed as Black. And Historians agree that Jesus and August Caesar lived in the same era; why can’t I say that the original Hebrews were Black. Prior to the Arab Slave Trade, was North Africa/Middle East not generally darker?</div>

    <div class="md">So why is [Cleopatra currently depicted](https://slate.com/culture/2023/05/queen-cleopatra-black-netflix-show-race-history.html) as Black? 

In this [subreddit](https://slate.com/culture/2023/05/queen-cleopatra-black-netflix-show-race-history.html) the consensus was that Jesus along with the Hebrews would appear to definitely not be White, and the slight majority agreed that they’d most likely appear to be Black, no different than an Ethiopian. 

But there is no **clear consensus** that Jesus and the original Hebrews weren’t Black. Can I get a link? 

Yes, I know it’s just a rapper. [But even proud Jew Iron Solomon](https://youtu.be/WCPSdqq8vCY?si=bjKJ1yvla2h7dWhL) agrees that the original Hebrews were Black.</div>

If I pick up a comic book about Spider Man in New York City, does that make Spider Man real? Will I see him if I go to NYC?

>In this [subreddit](https://slate.com/culture/2023/05/queen-cleopatra-black-netflix-show-race-history.html) the consensus was that Jesus along with the Hebrews would appear to definitely not be White,

Middle East peoples are not white. Egyptians are not white. Asia is not white. The Pacific Islands are not white. And none of those peoples are black. 

Something being not-white does not mean black. There is more than white or black.

>But there is no **clear consensus** that Jesus and the original Hebrews weren’t Black. 

There is. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929717302768](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0002929717302768)

Canaanites direct descendants are Lebanese. Canaanites are neighbors and directly referenced in Israeli history. 

Let us look at what modern day Lebanese people look like.

All that dark hair, dark skin. Not black. Not white either. If you wanted to use a color, it would be light brown.

    <div class="md">Thank you for that last link. 

1) I’m not dumb and don’t appreciate the comic book, insulting reference. I’m aware that Polynesians, Asians aren’t White or Black, but I incorrectly assumed that in North Africa & the Middle East, prior to the Trans-Sahara Slave Trade of the Middle Ages, made it more cut & dry. I mean that Ethiopians (East Africans) are seen and treated like Blacks during my upbringing. I incorrectly assumed that this is what North Africa looked like prior to the aforementioned Slave Trade. 

2) There was a time 2014-2022 approximately 8 years in which a vast majority of people were incorrectly, inaccurately describing Black History; due to White guilt & over-correction. This is the reason why Netflix is depicting [Cleopatra](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/netflix-cleopatra-black-egypt-controversy-ancient-queen/) and [Hannibal](https://www.google.com/search?q=hannibal+black+netflix&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari) as Black. Bottom line is that I had plenty of guidance and being misinformed and don’t deserve to be insulted and labeled an antisemite (not on this thread, but in the above post). White guilt and over-correction led this mistake on my behalf, just a much as Black Superiority ideology. I **never** would have or believed in denying anyone of their rights, who disagreed with my incorrect beliefs, but I was still very much incorrect.</div>

You asked me why a Netflix entertainment show portrays someone as black, as if that means anything.

Works of fiction are that. Fiction. And their casting decision has been widely mocked by historians. 

I responded with an argument of what I considered equivalent seriousness.</div>

    <div class="md">Don’t antagonize me. Jesus was falsely depicted was (dirty) Blonde Hair and Blue eyes during my childhood. So I genuinely had reason to doubt what I was taught. Believe it or not, a White Teacher corrected me when I assumed Cleopatra was ethically Greek, and thus her relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony weren’t groundbreaking interracial relationships. Again, a White Teacher corrected me in 2012 and 2015. One pointed to the West African features [Bust of the most iconic of the Pyramids of Giza](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&sca_esv=0ecad74c06ff5026&hl=en-us&sxsrf=ACQVn08a-MvP3iQrNTeRzJK9mi9DpJo9Rg:1708307189838&q=pyramids+of+giza+face&uds=AMwkrPt2njJxP_lufgJpc9S0GqmT4yZIb9CuAk9JwmdGNQpNTPTp5iXqMXvxukqMGdts8ooTCAKIgqTJSXY_XwG6fjSP8HyY8ratCE01CuBCvuHw60H_Ftg0FtOMvK76-vJGeLQFX5Uw8Xu59FqP2c0JgPJgeh6mkGtbYFZn5OE31M8BGCUA5tzCxFlKvVqkIKixTE_stial-r6jtcnYZwx2AgJ9Ch_JJ1m_nYXVaFY-3FBMmus9BELIKJPySYa3JowOUc_b1iQaF88Eq4F8nLrLLKv6WOQ5yw&udm=2&prmd=ivsnmbhtz&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYt96ZpLaEAxXG4MkDHTNuA-kQtKgLegQIERAB&biw=375&bih=626&dpr=3). Again, two different White teachers who I now believe had White guilt, taught me to believe Cleopatra (and ancient Egyptians) were Black. 

I made the incorrect assumption that the original Hebrews were Black; because I assumed the Trans-Sahara Slave Trade of the Middle Age had a drastically different impact. 

I also allowed Whitewashing in [Latin America](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/black-in-latin-america/) to convince me that the coins of Hannibal and images of Ptolemy (astronomer) and Eratosthenes (mathematician, geographer) were simply inaccurate.</div>

    <div class="md">There is a consensus answer. You are just reading Reddit and not actual historical works. Black people come from Subsaharan Africa, not Judea. DNA survives for millions of years and it’s not too hard to test some old bones to see who in the modern day is most related to those bones. Cleopatra’s remains were never found so they can’t be tested but she descends from one of Alexander the Great’s Greek generals.</div>

    <div class="md">You’re an asshole! And many Whites have spread this nonsense along with Blacks. Tell your fucking kids to stay off Netflix, Rap Music (Kendrick Lamar believes the same thing I was taught), Wild N Out (Nick Canon believes the same thing I was taught) 

And [this link](https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/22/health/ancient-egypt-mummy-dna-genome-heritage/index.html) gives some credence to what I believed you rude asshole. The findings shocked the anthropologists! We are all human asshole, and some of us are trying to learn! 

*It's really **unexpected** that we see this very late shift," Krause says. He suspects increased trade along the Nile—including the slave trade—or the spread of Islam in the Middle Ages may have intensified contact between Northern and sub-Saharan Africa* 

*”A lot of people has **assumed** foreign invaders ... brought a lot of genetic ancestry into the region," Krause said. "**People expected** that through time, Egypt would become more European, but we see the exact opposite."

Modern Egyptians were found to "inherit 8% more ancestry from African ancestors" than the mummies studied. The paper cites increased mobility along the Nile, increased long-distance commerce and the era of the trans-Saharan slave trade as potential reasons why.”*</div>

    <div class="md">What is the apperance of Christ? How did all of His ancestors look?

In a letter to the Roman Emperor Pontius Pilates wrote and I quote: "His golden colored hair and beard gave to his  appearance a celestial aspect. He appeared to be about 30 years of age. Never have I seen a sweeter or more serene countenance. What a contrast between Him and His bearers with their black beards and tawny complexions!"

The archko volume: 
1) "(...) He is the picture of his mother, only he has not her smooth, round face. His hair is a little more golden than hers (...)"
2) "(...) His eyes are large and soft blue, and rather dull and heavy (...)"

The description of Publius Lentullus of Christ: "(...) his hair of (the colour of) the chestnut, full ripe, plain to His ears, whence downwards it is more orient and curling and wavering about his shoulders(...)" - "(...) His eyes grey, clear, and quick-in reproving hypocrisy He is terrible; in admonishing, courteous and fair spoken; pleasant in conversation mixed of gravity (...)"

Ruddy in the bible means: (of a white person's skin) having a red color, often suggesting good health - a ruddy cheeked girl (a white girl of good health)

David, an ancestor of Christ was described as follows: 
1) "And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he." - Samuel 16:12 -KJV
2) "And when the philistine looked about, and saw david, he disdained him: for he was but a youth and RUDDY, and of a fair countenance" - Samuel 17:42 - KJV

Solomon, son of David is described as: "My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand" - Song of Solomon 5:10 - KJV

Christ is a descendant of both David and Solomon - so what do you think he looked like?

"Fair" is an old english word which also means: (of skin) pale, or (of hair) pale yellow or gold.

In acts we read: "In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months" - Moses is a of the line Christ was born from.


The bible describes the Nazarites, Christs people, as: "The Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire (blue veins)" - Lamentation 4:7</div>

    <div class="md">Great now we are using sources! [Revelations 1:9-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201%3A9-18&version=NIV) I was always raised to believe that these scriptures hint at a Black Man. This was also used in Malcolm X (movie). And many others like myself have been taught this … 

*13 and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man,[a] dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. 14 The hair on his head was white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire. 15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.*</div>

    <div class="md">This has been used and debunked many times.
This was a vision by the apostle John, where he explicitly described the return being “as straight out of an oven.”
Why would John 
1. Describe just his feet bronze, not his whole body
2. Why did John feel to mention his bronze feet (again, as if he had just come out of a fire, not blackened) in a vision of revelation? If Jesus had always been tanned/black, why would John bring it up only at his vision of the end of time?</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t see why it’s important than John describes his feet, voice, and hair; but not his total bodily description. I’m not trying to patronize, can you list what would make his descriptions of those three features indicative that it wasn’t Jesus’s or normal Hebrew features (of that time)? 

I also don’t see the correlation of John only describing Jesus’s personal attributes (voice, hair, feet) but not in his Gospel or 3 Books (of John I, II, III).</div>

    <div class="md">The point was John was not making a statement in revelation on how Jesus looked on the earth.
It’s how *different* he looked, now that he was returning.
He had a celestial appearance, flaming and fiery.
This was clearly a symbolic description of his resurrection.
You stick with the hair and the feet being a literal thing, but surely you don’t think Jesus was walking around with literal flames in his eyes on earth, or he spoke the sounds a river would make?
Why leave those out?
Because this verse is a symbolic representation of him to come, and his celestial appearance. Nothing about this verse was meant to represent Christ’s earthly body.</div>

Not “all” religious scholar disagree with it, there are many, especially Catholic, that do agree with it. That was an egregious claim, especially for a website as reliable and citable as Wikipedia.

That being said, I know about it’s controversial nature, and that’s why it was a tiny portion of my entire argument.</div>

    <div class="md">But we’re discussing the Middle East / North African region. So we don’t have to be so vague. My early research is pointing to Hannibal being [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia). My early research points to Cleopatra being of Greek descent but her **mother’s ethnicity** seems to be vague and her **paternal grandmother’s** ethnicity seems to be vague. The consensus is that they could be Persian or Egyptian. The fact the she spoke Egyptian as well as Greek is logic based deductions of her being ethically Egyptian.</div>

    <div class="md">It's probably deemed as antisemitic because the Black Hebrew Israelites are a thing, and a bunch of them are pretty antisemitic.

    <div class="md">Yes! And I completely understand where Kanye and Kyrie Irving cross the line comparing Judaism to Freemasonry and alleging Satanic references. 

I’m even well read on the original doctrine of the NOI as covered in the autobiography of Malcolm X.

My mind is being blown as to why [Iron Solomon](https://youtu.be/WCPSdqq8vCY?si=bjKJ1yvla2h7dWhL) basically gives into peer pressure and allows JC to rap what I have been misinformed (from my early research into the topic). I am amazed that Netflix is perpetuating that historical Whitewashing is essentially curable by what now appears to be, historical Blackwashing. 

There are many others like myself who truly believed that before the Trans-Sahara Slave Trade of the Middle Ages, that North Africa/Middle East was Black (more or less).</div>

    <div class="md">See I thought that it was the claims that Jews were behind many coverts acts carried out by Freemasons & [this 12 lost tribes of Israel conspiracy](https://x.com/1303quez/status/1588466533097148416?s=46&t=Y7tRZiH7iEsf8z8n7FTzjg). I had no idea that there was so much credible evidence that the Original Hebrews & Jesus weren’t White or Black. 

[Iron Solomon vs JC](https://youtu.be/WCPSdqq8vCY?si=JTVwyktVC4CS3AYL) (2018) Iron Solomon, a proud Jew (based on his public persona at least) even conceded that JC was correct about the original Hebrews being Black. 

I never bought into Judaism overlapping with Satanic connections and freemasonry. But I had always been taught to believe that European Jews were only one sub-ethnic group of Israelites. That they moved to Europe during the Trans-Sahara Slave trade of the Middle Ages, and came to populate the Zionist movement of the 20th Century because they had been cut off from Israel (geographically speaking); while the original Hebrews had also been cut off of the region during the aforementioned slave trade. Nothing I believed in attributed some Jewish conspiracy to rob Blacks of their history. The Jewish Diaspora of the Middle Ages is real, but now it seems that even before that, the region wasn’t Black.</div>
