      <div class="md">I see that u/bear-in-exile has posted to this sub. He would seem to have been treated fairly by the mods, so I'll try posting here.

r / Areology is an alleged planetology group, run by somebody who claims to be a PhD student in that subject. There are good reasons to doubt that he is what he claims to be, not the least of which is he didn't know what a fossil was. He thought that they were living organisms trapped in rock.

[Somebody asked the possibility finding fossils on Mars could be ruled out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gkr9cgc/). Bear gave [the only honest answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gktsckp/) that could be given to such a question: that it was too early to rule that out, because there have been no digs on Mars, yet. Everything seen, so far, has either been on the surface within a few centimeters of it. The mod then [exposed his ignorance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gku1nbi/), sharing these words of wisdom about "fossils"

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Further, the radiation on Mars will essentially sanitize the top few meters of Martian soil so finding microbes preserved in rock near the surface is nigh impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fossils are dead, already. One doesn't have to worry about them dying from radiation poisoning. If you take a rock, and leave it next to a nuclear reactor core, it's going to go on being a rock, because what else would it be? By posting what he did, the mod revealed a level of scientific literacy that would considered low by the standards of a grade school science fair. Even a little kid with a rock collection knows what a fossil is. Yet, somebody claims to be a PhD student in Planetology did not.

Somebody then replied to [the mod's strange comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gku1nbi/). I could only guess who, because the mod removed the comment while leaving [his rebuttal to the reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gkujydl/) visible. In it, I saw something that made me laugh. The mod had written

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You will not find bone on Mars. Without bone, you do not get mineral replacement which is what you're talking about re: fossils being rock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Nine days ago, I saw that and [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gpchg8j/), writing

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Really? Ferns have bones in them?

&gt;I learn something new every day.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Follow the links. They go to some very straightforward pages on legitimate academic sites. On them, you can find mentions of fossils of ferns, jellyfish and insects. I think that we all know that none of these organisms have bones. Once again, the mod (who claimed to be a PhD student) didn't know what he was talking about. I guess that he wasn't too happy to have that fact exposed, because less than an hour later, my comment got its one and only downvote. I could reasonably guess who cast it and, much impressed by the childishness of such an act, gave r / Areology no more thought, until about 12 hours ago when I got this message:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r / Areology. You can still view and subscribe to r / Areology, but you won't be able to post or comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note from the moderators:  
&gt;  
&gt;"Be smarter next time 🤡"  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r / Areology by replying to this message.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I had only posted to r / Areology once, so I knew what this was about. This was payback for posting some links to pages about fossils from non-vertebrate organisms, and a mild expression of amusement. Three hours ago, I wrote back to tell the mod exactly what I thought of him and his sub. I've stuck spaces in between the letters in his usename, because a friend tells me that Reddit will get mad at me if I don't. I wrote

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hello, O m i c r o n C e t i. Be smarter, next time? Why would there be a next time? You were presented with a perfectly valid, documented point, and responded to it as a small child would. Asking around, I find that you have a history of doing this.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you really are a PhD student, as you claim, you must either be at a very bad school. or one with an easily bribed admissions committee. Enjoy your 15 minutes of not quite fame as a "power mod," I really don't care.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About an hour ago, OC replied. I think he was trying to bully me into silence. He falsely accused me of block evasion, and then told me that this was a violation of the TOS. In other words, he was threatening to trump up a charge and try to get me thrown off the site because I fact checked an incorrect claim of his, and was open about being mildly amused by his mistake. OC then went on to show what a big man he was by muting me, after which I laughed at him some more.

End of story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If this group is like anti-censorship groups on other sites, you're maybe thinking that I'm going to ask you to persuade OC to let me back into his group. If so, thank you, but no. I'm very happy to be out of that group. I couldn't be paid enough to post there, again.

I do, however, feel that this is worth talking about. When a fake scientist like OC speaks up, people who have really been to graduate school in the sciences can usually see through him fairly quickly, but most of the world hasn't even been to college, much less grad school. When somebody lies, claims to be a PhD (or PhD student), and sets himself up as a source of information on what he claims to be his field, if he acts confident enough, he can get a lot of laymen to take him at his word. For this reason, the social media sites have been turning into fountains of misinformation. Reddit would not seem to be an exception.

People who are genuinely curious about a legitimate, wholesome subject and are willing to put in the time and effort to learn something about it should find their efforts rewarded. Somebody with my background can see a phony for what he is, fairly quickly, and walk away with no harm done, but the sincere amateur can put in time and work and in the end, find that a mockery has been made of his passion, because what he has learned is nonsense, taught by a charlatan. All of his time and work has gone for nothing. He's been robbed, and maybe made to feel foolish, because he trusted the wrong fake teacher.

That stinks. The dedicated layman deserves better, so when I see an academic phony, I'm going to speak up. There are going to be people like OC who use censorship as a weapon, in order to silence those who would expose them. I refuse to be silenced, because some things are just simply wrong.</div>

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Going to the former location of his profile, I see that r / OmiconCeti is no longer on Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[https://archive.is/ezB3G](https://archive.is/ezB3G) &lt;- (archived copy of the "page not found" message at that location)

&amp;#x200B;

and his posts in the thread written about are no longer visible. One can, however, still find them in context in this archived copy of the whole discussion.

[https://archive.is/j9439](https://archive.is/j9439)

which is an archived copy of

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gu66llies\_and\_icerich\_material/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gu66llies_and_icerich_material/)

&amp;#x200B;

The remaining mods on r / Areology have set the mod list to private, for whatever reason, but as one can see by looking at this archived copy of the front page for the sub, r / OmicronCeti was still on the list of moderators as recently as a few hours ago.

[https://archive.is/984M2](https://archive.is/984M2)

The list of moderators for the sub is in Archive Today, as well

[http://archive.is/DlA6s](http://archive.is/DlA6s)

where it will stay. There will be no rewriting of history. He was one of the mods on that subreddit, and he did say the things attributed to him. After coming into this discussion in order to threaten to stalk the OP, he deleted his account and ran away. Not a surprise. Bullies tend to be cowards. As do trolls.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I can't help but notice while the critical replies to what our runaway mod abuser wrote were blocked quickly, leaving them visible only to me and to the mods on r / Areology, they've continued to be downvoted. This, by itself, would be enough to answer what might be the next question: since the abusive mod has left Reddit in disgrace, am I going to appeal my banning? The answer is "no." The very fact that they'd take the time to downvote a comment that had already removed is a clear sign of malice. I would not get a fair hearing out of them, and for all I know, r / OmicronCeti could have been one of their sock puppets, somebody one of them created so that he could act poorly and not take be blamed for his own actions. The very fact that they tried to give themselves (or himself) plausible deniability by hiding the mod list from view suggests that at least one of the remaining mods would be the kind of person to do a thing like that.

No, I think that going back to where drama like this happened is a bad idea, in general. It's not going to be the start of anything good. At best, if one gets back into a place one has been thrown out of, the people running the place are going to be looking for excuses to throw one out again, so they can regain the face they lost. One does well to find joy in the fact of one's exile and move on to better places.</div>

    <div class="md">Note to anybody late to this thread:

r / OmicronCeti posted a personal attack against the OP a few days ago. It stayed up for a few days. Some of us gave him the reply he deserved. I think that the mods for this sub deleted his comments today, because when I go to my profile, I see "comment deleted by moderators" messages where his comments used to be. Or maybe that's just something that gets inserted when a user deletes his own account, as r / O. C. did today?

I don't know. Anyhow, just wanted to be clear that I didn't start posting a multi-part monologue for no reason. I was responding to somebody.</div>

Seriously? How is "the\_very\_least" similar to "bear-in-exile"? The use of punctuation to separate the words? I don't believe that I invented that. But if so, I've been a busy boy. Just count the number of active blogs, groups and websites that have hyphens and underscores in their urls, all of which would seem to have been created and run by me. Oh, however do I find the time?

As anybody who has actually been in graduate school knows, one doesn't generally get published until after one has defended one's thesis, and is no longer in graduate school. An already granted PhD is a minimal requirement for the publication of research, so this supposed distinction that you point to is one that I share with everybody who (unlike you) really is a graduate student in a STEM subject.

We're a small segment of the population, but we're not that small. There's certainly more than one of us.

If we are to take you at your word when you speak about your background, you would have those same interests. In case you've forgotten, you've tried to pass yourself off as a second or third year PhD student in Planetology. The last I checked, Planetology was a science, a branch of Astronomy to be exact.

Therefore, by your logic, we're the same person. Fascinating.

Let's take a look at how that came up, and just what an incredible s\*\*theel you are. Somebody [reported being locked out of his Twitter accoun](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/m1sd30/locked_out_of_hacked_account/)t, which had been hacked. He was running into a problem of poor planning on Twitter's part. Since the hacker changed his account's contact email address, the system would not let him report the hacking. I attempted to help him, by posting a message about his post, directing it to Twitter support, and giving them a link back to his problem report here on Reddit. [I then told him about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/m1sd30/locked_out_of_hacked_account/gqhuojx/). Assuming that the user is a he. If I'm misgendering this individual, I apologize.

So far, we have you trying to make use of my effort to help out somebody who was in a bad situation in an attempt to throw some mud in my direction and see if it would stick, but this gets better.

I was informed by somebody already on Reddit that direct linking to other subs tends to encourage brigading, and that direct linking to an individual profile is considered a form of harassment under the terms of service. I've seen a number of mods insist that their users refrain from these practices. As I have no desire to antagonize Reddit or create problems for responsible moderators, I saw no reason to not comply with these demands.

Yes, I am indeed Jewish. Like 230,000 other Chicagoans. Is that a problem for you? Are you maybe a little bit bigoted? By the way, Jewish mathematicians are about as rare as Jewish lawyers, doctors or agents in show business. We've been "overrepresented" in my own field since the Middle Ages.

No. That's a false quote from [the screenshot you give us](https://i.imgur.com/PTaxQNm.png). Let's take a look at what it actually says about that user's politics.

"Politically Centrist (recovering libertarian)"

That suggests a rejection of libertarianism, not an embrace of it. Note the mocking reference to the phrase "recovering alcoholic." Somebody who called himself a recovering libertarian would be somebody who was embarrassed by his earlier ideology.

I just set up a few blogs which I now intend to use. Yes, they link together. As for why that's supposed to be an issue, I don't know and I don't think that you do, either. What was that old saying?

"If you can't wow them with substance, baffle them with bullsh\*\*."

That's what you've been doing. You're a vindictive troll with nothing of value to add to this or any other discussion, who has wasted my evening with innuendo and head games, because you weren't man enough to handle the fact that you lost an argument. You're a pathetic, bigoted excuse for a human being.

&amp;#x200B;

To be exact, I posted there once. That hardly qualifies as being "active" on a subreddit. While browsing Bear's profile, I saw that a legitimate comment he posted had been censored, and said something about the mod abuse. That comment can be found at

[https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how\_to\_use\_cold\_smoked\_mackerel/gpccwb5/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RussianFood/comments/lacnrn/how_to_use_cold_smoked_mackerel/gpccwb5/)

Let's take a look at what I said, in its entirety.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Going to u / bear-in-exile's profile, I see a comment about curing through the use of cold smoking being a form of preservation, not one of cooking, one that prevents spoilage but doesn't do anything to get rid of parasites.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1393/pdf/circ1393.pdf](https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1393/pdf/circ1393.pdf)  
&gt;  
&gt;His comment is accurate, yet, when I come into this subreddit, I don't see it. One of the mods must have removed it. This is not acceptable. Correct information about a health risk should not be responded to with censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The quote above is the sum total of all that I've ever posted to the Russian Food subreddit.

Follow the link to the government website. Everything I've said is correct, yet you have the nerve to act as if there was something damaging to be found in the fact that I posted that comment. This is a continuing pattern of behavior with you. You have repeatedly taken the position that a user who does a fact check and a provides a link to relevant documentation has committed an offense which he must be confronted over. This is the pattern of somebody who is flying into a narcissistic rage.

Let us note that you then tried to amplify what was not merely a weak argument, but a psychotic one, by describing the same post twice. First you referred to it as a time I supported Bear, and you referred to it as my history of being active on a subreddit focused on food I can't eat. Russian food is not particularly kosher. 

&amp;#x200B;

What else did you claim?

&amp;#x200B;

Not a coincidence. I see stupid stuff on the Internet every day, like everybody else, but what you posted stood out. You said  that fossils would be killed by radiation, and that only organisms with bones could leave fossils behind. After I provided you with three classes of counterexamples to your claim (plants, insects and jellyfish) and links documenting the fact that you were wrong, and watched you throw that starting mini-tantrum, I had no trouble knowing who the voice of reason was in that discussion. I start browsing his profile, to see if I could find anything interesting on it.

I would have browsed yours, but I've never been a fan of copypasta.

Bear has been on this site since the lockdowns began, and found his way into more than a few fights. Out of all of those, the only one I've supported him in is the one that I just mentioned. I did so for the same reason I helped out the guy in r/Twitter, who isn't me, either. Because right is right and wrong is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;The sequence:

&gt;They are found out and banned again, and reported to the admins for ban evasion.

&amp;#x200B;

Your theory is that I'm Bear's sock puppet, that he invented me in order to get back into your subreddit? Just one problem with that theory, aside from the fact that I've been running groups on Flickr with thousands of members since I was a tween, which would make me too time consuming an identity to fake. The problem is that I have tweets going back to 2009, and Bear's run-in with you happened this year. Your position, then, is that Bear knew what you were going to do 12 years before you did it, and he invented me to give himself cover for a fight, 12 years in advance?

Do I really have to explain to you why that sounds crazy?</div>

What an interestingly judgmental comment about about my posting history to see come out of the moderator for r/Areology. You're running a subreddit about the geology of Mars. 

r/TheLiveOn is another subreddit about Mars. You see two people posting to a discussion on your sub. Then, after you decide to go dig up some dirt on me in order to get even with me for the fact that I showed you up in an argument, you point to the fact that we both showed in another subreddit that happened to be about Mars and act like that fact is damningly meaningful.

People who read one subreddit about a particular subject are likely to read other subreddits about the same subject, especially when the first subreddit is being modded by an abusive, psychotic man-child who cyberstalks and drives off his own membership. What's next? Are you going to try to dox me?

That having been said, let's take a look at my history on r/theliveon. Here it is: I posted a comment explaining why trying to make Mars into a second Earth was probably not a good idea, even in theory

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping\_mars\_or\_transform\_it\_not\_terraforming/gpc9gbe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping_mars_or_transform_it_not_terraforming/gpc9gbe/)

along with a short continuation 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping\_mars\_or\_transform\_it\_not\_terraforming/gpt7qqp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/theliveon/comments/lkob1a/keeping_mars_or_transform_it_not_terraforming/gpt7qqp/)

that linked to another comment on another subreddit

[https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/lwf0go/atmosphere\_on\_mars/gpt6m60/](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/lwf0go/atmosphere_on_mars/gpt6m60/)

in which I explained why one could solve the problems I mentioned by just using less air.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I posted there once, posting one comment followed by a link to a comment of mine somewhere else, and never posted there, again. How does that qualify as "being active" on that subreddit? Of course, it doesn't and you know it doesn't. Your hope seems to be that by acting like an aggressive lunatic, you're going to intimidate those reading this into going along with what you have to say.

Is this the sort of behavior that one should expect to see out of a moderator, or even out of a functioning adult?</div>

there's nothing subtle about his anti-Semitism. Now, we have him pointing to the discovery that Bear doesn't approve of anti-Semitism in much the same tone, acting as if it was a great piece of dirt he just dug up.

The reality is that outside of some echo chambers on the social web, most Americans really don't like Nazis very much, and Chicagoans typically like them less than most Americans do. Opposition to anti-Semitism is the rule, not the exception, just like opposition to racism, misogyny, homophobia, and any number of other forms of bigotry. Support for the freedom to say ignorant, hateful things isn't the same thing as support for the ignorance or the Hate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This why you'll see [/u/bear\_in\_exile](https://www.reddit.com/u/bear_in_exile/) show up to [defend poor little /u/minimal\_art](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/ln0b73/better_not_talk_about_it_one_of_the_latest_scary/gnymt7k/?context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Follow the link and you'll see something damning, to be sure: it casts u / OmicronCeti in a very bad light. u / minimal\_art reports a history of "pretextual harassment" on Twitter that goes back a few years, to a time when a time when he was "dogpiled" by some of the Nazis on Twitter. Even since then, he has been getting locked out without cause, most recently just for logging into his account. He mentioned the incident, and then got slurred.

&amp;#x200B;

That wasn't a discussion. That was just racial abuse. It was ugly, stupid, shameful behavior, but take a good look: counting u / OmicronCeti, we're looking at a grand total of four members for the local Hitler fan club. They're the lunatic fringe, not the norm.

Finding somebody who is opposed to their Hate in Chicago is about as surprising as finding somebody who isn't a fan of Saddam Hussein in a VFW meeting. That's the norm. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

By now, I think I'm made my point. I also think that OC has wasted more than enough of my time with his derangement. I will say that I find it a little troubling that when somebody like OC or the people in that other discussion show up, that the people in this sub get so quietly, so quickly.

Are you all really that scared of crazy people?</div>

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This person has an innumerable network of shitty blogs and tumblrs 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;which are all interconnected and give away a shocking amount of personal information.

&amp;#x200B;

They really don't. If you read my blogs, you're going to learn very little about me.  That's by design. You'll see some photography, a few op eds, things like that. The most you will learn is that I live in Chicago, proper, like 2.7 million other people, and that I'm a Jewish grad student in Math. Where in Chicago, I never say. No personal photos, no comments about my family, etc. etc.

But notice how he has responded to reasonable criticism, first of what he said scientifically, and then of his out of control behavior afterwards: with a barely veiled threat of stalking, with support for racial abuse, and with an attempt to abuse the complaint system on Reddit by using it as a tool of personal revenge.

This is disgusting behavior on his part.</div>

    <div class="md">**Title:** "Banned from r/AnimalsOnReddit for engaging in verbal violence against chickens!"

**Url:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/krbdce/banned\_from\_ranimalsonreddit\_for\_engaging\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/krbdce/banned_from_ranimalsonreddit_for_engaging_in/)

**Date and Time:** Like I'd know that.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Post:** I went into [this stream](https://np.reddit.com/rpan/r/AnimalsOnReddit/kr4qxd) on r / AnimalsOnReddit, toward the end, about five hours ago. Somebody had his pet chickens out, and a few of us joked about what we were going to have for dinner, and shared [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL4b0Pc1xIs). The stream quickly ended, because of technical problems we thought. But apparently, we were wrong, and we were on report.

Two hours ago, I was sent a message by the anonymous mods of that subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r / AnimalsOnReddit. You can still view and subscribe to r / AnimalsOnReddit, but you won't be able to post or comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note from the moderators:  
&gt;  
&gt;[This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/AnimalsOnReddit/comments/kr4qxd/watching_chickies_day_202/gi7l725/?context=9) may have fully or partially contributed to your ban:  
&gt;  
&gt;..  
&gt;  
&gt;..  
&gt;  
&gt;***frogisthebest:***  *oh cute*  
&gt;  
&gt;***bear-in-exile:***   *They're going to get slaughtered at the end of the stream.*  
&gt;  
&gt;..  
&gt;  
&gt;..  
&gt;  
&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r / AnimalsOnReddit by replying to this message.  
&gt;  
&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

It's like improv. You just had to be there at the time. After I got done catching up on some missing sleep, I woke up, saw the message, and had no trouble crafting a to-the-point response.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Got it. You have no sense of humor. You can't understand the difference between a joke and a serious statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for banning me so quickly, then. Your group was going to be a joyless experience, if that's how it's run.

&amp;#x200B;

Less than a minute later, the anonymous mod tried to put me in my place, by telling me that he wouldn't let me back into a group that, at that point, I had no desire to be in. After I told him that much.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To quote Rule #2 of our subreddit:  
&gt;  
&gt;*No animal cruelty*  
&gt;  
&gt;*No violence against animals (physical or verbal). This includes (but is not limited to)comments and jokes about harming or eating the animal.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*All instances of animal cruelty will result in a permanent ban.*  
&gt;  
&gt;This rule is posted via automod on every stream for viewers to see. It is incredibly rude to make jokes like that to streamers, your ban will remain.

&amp;#x200B;

I could have left it alone, but this was lolcow gold. 54 minutes ago, I wrote back.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which part of "I'm more than happy to leave your sorry excuse for a subreddit" are you having trouble understanding?  
&gt;  
&gt;I didn't notice that rule coming in, but if I had, I would have left the group instantly, because that rule is insane, and only lunatics establish insane rules. Even if the chickens could somehow see the stream, how would they be harmed by the sight? Are you under the impression that chickens can read, and be traumatized by what they're seeing?  
&gt;  
&gt;For verbal violence to be violence, it has to have an impact on the victim. They're chickens. They're not literate. Really.  
&gt;  
&gt;I swear to you that I'm not making this up.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I shouldn't tell him what I'm having for dinner, tonight? A little red wine, some tomatoes and mushrooms - Clucky will not have died for naught. So, sort of suspecting what had happened, I went back to the livestream, went to the profile of the person who posted it, and what do you know, interesting coincidence, he was a mod for that subreddit. One who was so traumatized by the fact that I posted the word "burp!" after somebody asked where the chickens had gone that he shut down the stream, immediately.

If I sound like I'm asking this group for help, believe me, I'm not, because I don't think I'm the one who needs it. I'm LMAO.  I was going to link to a video of Dana Carvey doing the least convincing Chinese accent in history, as he sang

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;"Somewhere, there's a place for us, peck my cheek and I'm halfway there ..."

&amp;#x200B;

but, of course, that video has recently been taken down for being "offensive." Said video having offended people on the same sites where one can find people celebrating the Holocaust (this is not a joke) and saying that if one doesn't enjoy watching old people get sick and die, that one hates America, with almost nobody objecting to either. But asking whether a chicken is a braiser or a roaster, or linking to a video in which an actor played a non-Anglo-Saxon character is a step too far? Really?

Ever get the feeling that the inmates have taken over the asylum?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It was absurd, but was it fair? I'm going to firmly say "no." Let's take at the rule quoted

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**2. No animal cruelty**  
&gt;  
&gt;No violence against animals (physical or verbal). This includes (but is not limited to) comments and jokes about harming or eating the animal.  
&gt;  
&gt;All instances of animal cruelty will result in a permanent ban.

&amp;#x200B;

and remember that until the specific rule is clicked on, all that is seen is the top line. Let us use our common sense (and yes, there is such a thing). Jokes about having chicken for dinner are not a form of animal cruelty for reasons given above, and because that term has a meaning established my common usage. For the mod to post a misleading summary of a rule in clear view and then take action against users who violate it is for the mod to turn his sub into a minefield. The bot notice the mod alludes to showed up in the stream *after* we had been posting our jokes.

Obviously, mods should not be hiding things in the fine print, just so they can play cat and mouse games with their members. The reason I'm putting this out for your amusement, rather than asking you for your help, is that while this was unfair, I'm feeling pretty zen about it.

His loss.   🤷    If you feel harmed by the wrong done to you, I'm not dismissing your concern, but I think that it's healthy for us to remind ourselves that the mods need us a lot more than we need them. If that realization leaves you feeling more relaxed, nothing wrong with that, right?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A few comments followed, including these:

&amp;#x200B;

**u / TheWalkingBag ;** *"Oh god, the animals are becoming self aware"*

**Me:**

*"They're  coming for you. I just saw a capon walking down the street with a  scalpel, saying "I wonder how plump and succulent The Walking Bag will  get after this."*

*You might want to bolt your door.*

 *By the way, I think Automoderator is in on it. He keeps taking down my warnings."*

&amp;#x200B;

as, in fact, it had, but for reasons that were more annoying than sinister.

is there really a need to cut and paste a discussion in this subreddit into another discussion in this same subreddit?

&amp;#x200B;

**Title** (yes, this is really the title): *"The Forbidden Prompt : \[WP\] Turns out that there was never really a plague spreading across the Earth. You just thought there was, because you died at the start of the year, and have been in Hell ever since. Hell, as it turns out, greatly resembles your homeland. In most ways. At least at first."*

&amp;#x200B;

**Text:** *"When  I would post this, elsewhere, I would add*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The  idea of the prompt is that at first, the protagonist didn't know he was  dead, because his afterlife looked so much like his old life, complete  with convincing imitations of some of the people he knew. But, bit by  bit, he finds that something is not quite right.*

&amp;#x200B;

*It's  a writer's prompt, something that a writer in a subreddit is invited to  use as the premise for a short story. One might imagine one wouldn't  see a lot of censorship in a fiction subreddit, because why would there  be? None of what is happening in any of these stories is supposed to be  real. Yet, so far, this prompt has been removed from r / fantasywriters  and r / WritingPrompts. Two subreddits in a row proved willing to censor  this prompt.*

*I've been on a  number of sites, some of which were infamous for their censorious mods,  but censoring fiction? I've never seen that happen, before, and on  Reddit, it is happening repeatedly."*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

to a question that u / KanataWaltz had asked four days earlier. While the tone of that earlier discussion wasn't as light as the one over on r/banned, to refer to sober criticism as "crying" is a bit much. I don't think there's going to be any serious disagreement about that.

    <div class="md">If anybody was wondering what triggered r / OmicronCeti, it was a pair of comments I posted to his group, which O.C. then deleted. Short form: He didn't know what a fossil was, looked foolish and got massively butthurt. In  “[Gullies and Ice-Rich Material](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/)”, u / By-Tor\_ asked

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Is it possible we can find fossils on Mars or is that completely ruled out? 

&amp;#x200B;

A real scientist would be reluctant to completely rule something out. Reluctance does not mean flat refusal. Just this morning, I completely ruled out the validity of somebody's bizarre claim that wind power would be a good source of energy on Mars, but in that case, I stood on solid theoretical ground. E= (1/2) m v \^ 2 (the formula for kinetic energy at sub-relativistic speeds) (\*) has stood up to centuries worth of experimental testing, and the thinness of the Martian atmosphere has been well established and quantified, as has the frequency with which various windspeeds are seen.

In this case, as I explained, the ground was not so solid and really, no competent, honest scientist could have quarreled with this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies\_and\_icerich\_material/gktsckp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Areology/comments/l4qi2m/gullies_and_icerich_material/gktsckp/)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;"Is it possible we can find fossils on Mars or is that completely ruled out?"  
&gt;  
&gt;Can't imagine why it would be. I hear there is evidence for flowing water on Mars as recently as a billion years ago  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/3/eaav7710](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/3/eaav7710)  
&gt;  
&gt;which would have given life a long time to evolve. None of the probes have had the ability to dig very deeply into Mars, and fossils are usually found underground. Also, rovers move slowly, and only a small portion of the surface has been covered, so even if small fossils were present on the surface, would we have been likely to find them, by now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Really, until a thorough exploration of the surface is done, I don't think the possibility of fossils being found can be ruled out.

&amp;#x200B;

Simple enough? Until we look, we don't know and nobody has really looked, yet, because the tools for looking don't exist, yet. There are no people on-site doing field work and there never have been, so any firm statements about what did or did not evolve on Mars before it died would be highly premature, the kind of statement that anybody who has been in a real graduate program knows not to make. So, of course, r / OmicronCeti went there, writing

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It all depends on what you mean by fossil (see my response above).  
&gt;  
&gt;Further, the radiation on Mars will essentially sanitize the top few meters of Martian soil so finding microbes preserved in rock near the surface is nigh impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

God help us all, this person who claimed to be a PhD student in Planetology (off-world Geology) thought that's what a fossil was - a living organism that somehow survived while embedded in solid rock. In short order, I could see what I was dealing with - a poster of copypasta. I replied, writing the first of the comments which O.C. has since deleted. It wasn't diplomatic, but then, it shouldn't have been. O.C. was engaging in academic fraud, passing himself off as something he was not. 

This is what I wrote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You claim to be a third year PhD student, yet you make this remarkable comment that suggests that you don't even know what a fossil is. Were you under the impression that the natural history museums had found actual, living non-therapod dinosaurs, and put them on display? If so, sorry to disappoint, but fossils are made out of lifeless rock. Ask a paleontologist to explain that to you or maybe my six year old cousin, if he isn't too busy. He has a collection. Radiation isn't going to do much to kill that which wasn't alive, to begin with.  
&gt;  
&gt;The environment of Mars has changed radically over the last few billion years. If you're going to try to argue that we can be sure that multicellular life never evolved on Mars based on present day conditions, that's not really a rational argument.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He replied with some more copypasta

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Ad hominem aside, let me lay this out more clearly for you:  
&gt;  
&gt;First, the surface of Mars has not changed radically over the last few billion years. The Amazonian had some glacial/periglacial activity along the dichotomy most notably, some very limited fluvial activity, and lava. That covers the last 3 billion years. The 'wet Mars' period covers the \~700 million years before that. The surface of Mars has been well-preserved since then: we can still see the effects of the flooding during this Hesperian period.  
&gt;  
&gt;You will not find bone on Mars. Without bone, you do not get mineral replacement which is what you're talking about re: fossils being rock.  
&gt;  
&gt;If we do any preserved biosignature, it will be be trace or microbial, and any microbes you could feasibly dig to will need to be near the surface. Solar and cosmogenic radiation destroy organic molecules after prolonged exposure at the Martian surface, so fresh outcrops (&lt;100ma) are the best place to look. This is why Jezero crater was selected for the 2020 rover.  
&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

and then deleted my reply. While I am, of course, not a planetologist, one doesn't have to be in a field to spot a phony. This

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;First, the surface of Mars has not changed radically over the last few billion years. 

&amp;#x200B;

was a controversial statement. Is it the controversial statement on this topic that is best supported by the currently available evidence? I wouldn't pretend to know, but I could see for myself that some people with some very solid credentials disagreed with what O.C. had to say. Also, that O.C. thought that fossils were organisms living inside of solid rock. In fact, not only did he not back off from that ridiculous assertion, he doubled down on it in this passage from the last long quote above.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Solar and cosmogenic radiation destroy organic molecules after prolonged exposure at the Martian surface

&amp;#x200B;

It was almost too much for me to take. I gave him the reply he deserved.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To say that somebody is being impossibly thick when he is being impossibly thick is not an "ad hominem," it's just the unflattering truth. The fact that you would misuse such a basic term would suggest that you have, in fact, never been to graduate school.  
&gt;  
&gt;I never claimed that living organisms of any sort were going to be found on the surface of Mars. Somebody asked about *fossils*, you simpleton. Do you know what a fossil is?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;By the way, I really am what I claim to be, and having written more than a few bibliographies along the way, I find the fact that you cite all of your sources from the same journal to be rather revealing. That's the sort of "scholarship" one expects to see somebody pick up over on a site like Wikipedia. Actual academics, before the Covid madness struck, tended to go into these places called "departmental libraries," where there would be a number of publications for them to look at and follow.  
&gt;  
&gt;Publications they'd remember, even after the libraries were closed down.  
&gt;  
&gt;They'd also know better than to think of a journal cite as a club to beat somebody over the head with. That might impress the rubes, but published papers have drawn conclusions that have gone on to be rejected by their research communities, more than infrequently. No PhD student would ever treat an article in one of them as holy scripture. He'd know better.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything, I was being too gentle with r / OmicronCeti. Even in high school, no teacher would have let me get away with the act of submitting a paper in which the bibliography consisted of cites from just one source. The absolute minimum for our little baby high school projects was five, and in a real research paper, the list will be far longer. This is not because the researcher is showing off, this is because the researcher knows that individual sources can be bad ones, and because even in peer reviewed publishing, referees carry biases and make mistakes. A conscientious researcher will do a survey of the literature, not take the first source he finds on faith, treating it as if it were holy scripture.

Yet, this is precisely what one can watch r / OmicronCeti doing. See for yourself - he keeps quoting Astrobiology, as if no other journal existed. This isn't scientists as scientists do it. This is science as the readers of science fiction imagine scientists do it. It's the sort of "science" one would see out of somebody who wanted the prestige of being a PhD without having to do the work to get one, which is to say the kind of "scientist" one finds on Reddit and social media far too often.</div>

    <div class="md">Having deleted my comments, r / O. C. then banned me from his subreddit. He dropped the ban hammer in order to protect his own fraudulent claim of expertise. Indeed, not only do we know that he is not a third year PhD student in Planetology, but from his bullet point rant above, one can tell that he has never been to graduate school in any subject, at all. No graduate student could have ever written this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;B Math grad student (but no publications...)

&amp;#x200B;

He'd know better. Even the professors, who already have PhDs after they submit articles for publication, will wait and wait to see them get published. That thesis one writes at the end of one's program will be the very first piece of research that a new PhD will have ever had published, and at that, one with a sadly limited circulation: one copy, sitting forlornly in the graduate student lounge, another sitting on the PhD's bookshelf and maybe a few in other locations. Maybe he'll go on to break the work up into pieces that aren't 900 pages long and try to get those pieces into journals so somebody will do something with his work other than balance an iced latte on its cover.

What he is almost certainly not going to do, outside of anywhere other than an undergraduate student's fantasy world, is show up in the literature, himself, before he graduates, because no committee would look at his work. There are too many articles from people with already granted degrees waiting to be looked at for a work by a graduate student to even be considered, unless he has somebody really powerful pushing for him.

We've all written term papers like anybody else, of course, but who would publish one of those? My papers sit where any graduate student's papers would sit, and where I assume u / the\_very\_least keeps his: in a locked filing cabinet, waiting for the day after my thesis defense. Where else would they be, other than in a desk drawer?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

While r / O. C.'s use of the ban hammer was certainly unethical, given that he was using it to protect the illusion that he carried credentials that he demonstrably did not, I gave it no more thought until a few days ago. While it was wrong, that kind of wrong has become commonplace. Fake scientists on the Internet seem to be about as common as fake CIA agents are in some bars. If I were to chase them all down and expose each one, I'd have no time to do anything else.

While I'm certainly annoyed by the impostors, as I should be, I do the only thing one really should do in most cases. I block them and forget about them, embracing the inevitability of the chaff driving out the wheat on social media. I deal with the idiots by refusing to grant them the battleground they desire. I leave them talking to themselves. My thought is that the more people who do that, the more blatantly stupid a lot of these fora will become, so blatantly so that eventually almost everybody will pick up on this and the cranks won't be able to fool anybody, any more.

I think it's a good approach, one that certainly does a lot to keep my blood pressure and stress levels down, and reduces the amount of time I have wasted by drama. It's one that I pursued with some seeming success in O.C.'s case that until very recently, I had forgotten who he was. But then u / the\_very\_least sent me a PM a few days ago, asking me to get involved. I said no. He then told me that r / O. C. was trying to get us both "thrown off of Reddit on a trumped up charge" and had tried to get u / the\_very\_least swatted, if I understood correctly.

That got my interest. I was about to leave Reddit, anyway, and probably will fairly soon (after I get around to giving away one of my subreddits and do a few final chores). But I can't laugh off a swatting. That would be psychotic, even as a response to a real provocation, and nothing either of us did would qualify as such in the eyes of any but the most disturbed individual. Going to u / the\_very\_least's 15 day old profile, I was able to find his one and only contribution to r / O. C.'s group, which I just archived.

&amp;#x200B;

In response to O.C.'s claim that only organisms with bones in them can leave fossils behind, he points out that insects, jellyfish and plants, none of which have bones, can all be found in the fossil record, and provides links supporting this claim. O.C.'s response to this, unless I've greatly misunderstood, was to try to get TVL's head blown off of his shoulders.

Am I next? Probably not, because I've never used my real name online or said much about my background. Still, the thought that somebody would want to do a thing like that is sobering. Somehow, I get the feeling that we're drifting off into Elliot Rodger territory on this one. Instead of having this violent reaction to an unmet sense of sexual entitlement, a la Elliott, O.C. would seem to be having one to an unmet sense of entitlement to prestige. In its own way, it's just as creepy.

I think that any reasonable person can see why I'm bringing my involvement with the Internet to any end. Who needs this?
