    <div class="md">When I was trying to get the ban repealed I looked at each one of the mods post history trying to see if there’d be one that wasn’t far left who maybe would be lenient on my one time offense. I literally never insulted someone on that sub before but that one dude called me shit so I responded. Apparently moron is too harsh for the mods. But yea each mod had a huge leftists disposition. This is Reddit for you, the average age is 21-25 at college and not employed. So you get this huge blue tint on everything you see here. It’s great when you subscribe to subreddits that have no bias or bullshit vague rules though.</div>

    <div class="md">Internet Nazis have spent years creating a caricature of everyone to the left of Mitch McConnell that's oversimplified to the point of uselessness. Recently, they've realized that that caricature is too simple to actually describe real people. However, instead of discarding it, they've decided that ~70% of the population isn't made up of real people.

They get the term "NPC," meaning "non-player character," from video games, which got it from tabletop RPGs. NPCs are controlled either by a computer or by someone who's also controlling lots of other characters, so they're understandably not very interesting or intelligent in most cases. In video games, they tend to repeat the same few lines every time a player interacts with them. 

Certain undesirable elements have decided that every criticism of the right essentially consists of meaningless, interchangeable insults, similar to the repetitive lines spoken by NPCs. To prove that they're better and more complex than the people they're stereotyping, they've taken to repeating the phrase "orange man bad" over and over. The irony of this is completely lost on them.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok so here's the non-retarded explanation:

There was a study a while back that showed something like 20% of people don't have an internal monologue that's formed in sentences. Idiots on /r9k/ misinterpreted this as not having any sort of stream of consciousness at all, and likened them to NPCs in a video game. That's where the meme comes from.  It's pretty much mutated from there into [this](https://xkcd.com/610/).</div>

In other words you didn't explain the meme at all, and suggested it has something to do with some study linked on a 4chan board which most people who use the meme have never even seen.</div>

An NPC is someone who cannot think for themselves. Like in a video game NPCs are characters without their own will and just have pre-determined responses for everything without giving any thought. Basically they are programmed people without any intelligence.</div>

    <div class="md">I was banned from r/news. Was suppose to be a temp ban for spamming. I was, I kept telling people... the north had slaves too. 

I was told that it was temporary and any moves by creating another account could be a permanent ban site wide. OK, no problem. This is my only account. 

My "temporary" ban is going on over a year.</div>

    <div class="md">Lol everyone is out to get you. 

How about, if you want to be a member of society, you start acting like a respectable member of the society.

Nothing is given, only earned. But you seem to feel like you're entitled to societies respect without putting in the minimum effort possible to earn it.</div>

    <div class="md">LOL dude this is an Internet forum shut the hell up. You’re talking about being a member of society on the internet when you have no idea in what shape way or form I provide to society in real life. I’ll tell you what though, I guarantee that I provide way more to our society then you. I don’t feel entitled for anything besides respect for a differing opinion on a forum based on free speech. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.</div>

    <div class="md">I'll answer both your questions, some dude insulted me after I gave him a full length rebuttal to his statement. Didn't even counter my argument just attacked me with an ad hominen. So I said something along the lines of "God you people truly are NPCs." because it's true they can't give a rebuttal so they just go back to insult mode. For no reason what so ever. Now for your second question, I'm banned from half of Reddit to subreddits I do not go to because I post on "Undesirable subreddits" not because I go to those subreddits and cause drama. Literally all my bans are "You have been banned for posting in problematic communites" I.E /r/The_Donald (Literally commented there once, don't even like that sub at all really.) /r/Conservative /r/Cringeanarachy and the likes. That's why I am banned from those Subs. Now this time on /r/News literally everything that happened is up there. Never be nice to mods. They're faggots.</div>
