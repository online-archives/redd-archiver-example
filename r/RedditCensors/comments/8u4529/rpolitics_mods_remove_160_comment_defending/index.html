    <div class="md">In 2016, rPolitics formalized its commitment to radicalizing its userbase when they allowed a news story about a black church being burned+vandalized with "vote trump" writings to gain 30k upvotes, but removed the subsequent story that it was a false flag by a church member at just 87 upvotes for being "off-topic". This is just the most famous of many incidents where subreddits such as rPolitics elicit an emotional response from their users and incite outrage without allowing them to 'come back down' by giving them the full story. Without the full story their audience is unable to humanize the other side resulting in the climate we see today where many rPolitics users legitimately believe that they are living in a nazi-like state and that violence can seemingly be justified to prevent perceived violence. 

However, this clearly does not reconcile with reality, and with each of these top-voted comments reddit loses more and more center/right users. As a result the rPolitics mods, who are likely paid political/media operatives, must now spend the majority of their moderation time policing their own radicalized ideologues to prevent them from damaging their political goals. </div>

    <div class="md">I remeber seeing posts about the church burning being a "false flag" . 

I do agree somewhat. I think its bad for this country to start attacking fellow voters. There are certainly hysterical voters in there and I hope people point this out more because all it does is divides.

But, if this is a sub against the radicalization of politics, can we talk about the donald too? At least in Politics you can sort by controversial to see opposing views. What is hapening over there is pretty bad as well and I think it is one of the reasons politics is becoming more left because it started this culture of only associating with your political group.</div>

    <div class="md">No one on TD is getting 160 upvotes for saying to never speak again to family members that voted for clinton over her acts in libya that created the enslavement of SSA migrants.

Fun fact: HRC's actions in Libya were so destructive that the Pentagon set up a [backchannel](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/28/hillary-clinton-undercut-on-libya-war-by-pentagon-/) to communicate with the Libyan government after it became clear that the goal was to destroy the country to open up human trafficking into europe and [smuggle Gaddafi's weapons into syria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHbrOg092GA). What I just linked you is the article that forced me to go from Sanders to Trump instead of "falling in line" with a warmonger.</div>

I see that instead of engaging in a legitnate conversation you are just obviously pushing an agenda and fail to see that you are doing what you claim the otherside is doing.</div>

    <div class="md">That’s the problem. They think that because we destroyed their countries it is our duty to take in their refugees, and that any terrorist attacks are our fault and should just be accepted as part and parcel of living in a big city. We also shouldn’t worry too much about them because you actually have a higher chance of being killed by your refrigerator than a terrorist. A suicide bomber killing fifty people in New York is the moral equivalent of a bad traffic accident. Just an entirely unpreventable freak accident that is bound to happen every once in a while.</div>

    <div class="md">It's not a Muslim restriction ban though. It's a temp ban on countries who are most likely to harbor and produce terrorists. 
If it were a Muslim-centric ban, he'd have banned the 3 most populated Muslim nations - Indonesia, Pakistan and India.. which are not banned.

    <div class="md">Sorry I meant to say that it's an admin-sanctioned *harassing* subreddit. You guys are the ones in every comment section on this site that's not narrative-approved. It, and topminds, are basically the political successors to SRS/CTR/SB...and isn't it interesting that 80% of the mods of AHS and TMOR also mod r/SPLCenter. I wonder if there is a connection to this and the org getting $400m in donations following the 2016 election hmm...</div>
