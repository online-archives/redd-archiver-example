    <div class="md">Koreans weren't "just protecting themselves" it's that false narrative that's the problem.  They were "protecting" their rackets (many of which were illegal) at the expense of Black lives.  If anything Black people were simply taking back what belonged to them, from people who were brought in by the white supremacist system to specifically displace Black people, families and businesses.  Think all those Asians went from making your "pork flied lice" to making six figures because they just worked harder? No they got ahead by cheating and robbing Black communities blind.  This was just justice and saying otherwise is accepting a narrative of white supremacy.</div>
