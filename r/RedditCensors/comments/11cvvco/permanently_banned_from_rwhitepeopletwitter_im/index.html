    <div class="md">I think you’re being subjected to heavy bias from the other commenters but I think you can do a couple things better. First off we can’t see what you were responding to or what your original comments were and we can’t see how many upvotes or downvotes your comment got where you defended yourself, so I can barely see the situation here. And then you’re engaging in name calling too which is usually bannable and it’s not effective at all and you’re not engaging in discourse when you do that. I’d say your probably correct that your being censored out but you can change your tactics and be less likely to be banned. And if you still get banned or deleted then come back and post again.</div>

    <div class="md">I forgot to add the original post. It was a post about Rep. Lauren Boebert commenting how gun owners should claim their firearms should be reported as lost in a boating accident, and there were a lot of replies and comments with the normal Conservative bad, Don't Tread On Me bad. The first comment I posted spoke simply about the actual meaning of Gadsden, Molon Labe, and the Thin Line flags/stickers. No profane language, Personal attacks or any other violation of Reddit Policy or even the subreddit policies. I was attacked from the outset with what I felt were unwarranted attacks &amp; language. The multiple responses I recieved were not going to be unanswered. When I posted the final, lengthy post to the jsin character that's when I got the "not enough karma" removal. So I then addressed the moderators directly since they allowed those attacks, and I will not be silenced by my critics. I'm not overly upset about being banned, however I feel it was unwarranted for the simple fact that I was "returning fire" to against those attacks.</div>

    <div class="md">I remember that sub as being one of many of the toxic political subs that regularly shows on the front page.  They regularly suspend such rules they make to keep order selectively depending on the political angle.  

You can curse someone out if you hate cops, or a bunch of other wedge-issue topics that's not in line with far-left wing politics, but the moment you fall outside of those narrow boundaries, a comment as simple as "I respectfully disagree with OP" will get you banned because it's "uncivil".

This type of behavior seems to be encouraged by the Admins, as promoting political polarization drives traffic  - thus revenue, to the site.   If you're not X, you're Y.  If it's not up, it's down.  If you don't hate THEM, you hate me, and all of those I associate with.  If you're not for us and our rigid agenda 100%, then not only are you against us, but you're a terrorist... etc.    They really seem to want to stifle any discourse that contains  free thought or anything straying from the preset binary political options - like the idea that maybe both X, and Y each have their own problems, and Z might be the better choice.</div>

    <div class="md">So, the base progressive, woke ideology playbook. It's sad to see the road that this has led the US down. The idea that people claim to want a debate but scream and yell as their form of presenting an argument is so unproductive. I joke that I have lost all faith in humanity, but it's becoming more and more of a true statement these days.</div>
