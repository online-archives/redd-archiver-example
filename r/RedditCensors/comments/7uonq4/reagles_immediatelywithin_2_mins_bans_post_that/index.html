-[Minneapolis airport uses around 1000 somolis](http://archive.is/bAOFC)  
-[Somolis like Abdirahmaan Muhumed had access to secret clearance and unfettered access to jetliners, special access to the tarmac, and special security clearances to other parts of the airport. He died fighting for isis in 2014](http://archive.is/v7TeK)  
-[Remember Abdisalan Hussein, who blew himself up in 2011 fighting for Al Shabaab, he also worked at the Minneapolis airport](http://archive.is/yP5Ze)  
-[Remember Shirwa Ahmed, who blew himself up fighting for terrorists in 2008, he also used to work at the Minneapolis airport](http://archive.is/zb5iu)  
-[Does the TSA even do background checks in Minneapolis? Nope they do cultural sensitivity meetings with the DHS as supervisors](http://archive.is/E533o)  
-[Mall of America will hold 5000 media members and be the main area for tv interviews and whatnot](http://archive.is/U2Ih9)  
-[Islamic terrorist group Al-Shabaab, the same group that recruits so many somolies from right down the street to mall of america, said in a 2015 video to attack the Mall Of America.](http://archive.is/Ll17y)  
-[Back in August 2017, another explosion happened in minneapolis mosque, owned by the same man who owned the mosque whom had a 'gas leak explosion' happen next door back on New Years 2014](http://archive.is/u66AJ)  
-[Will the police help? You mean the MN PD that has been fast-tracking diversity hire somoli muslims, like Mohomod Noor who shot a women in the head for no apparent reason when she called police to report a rape, the media refuses to address her death, the mayor betsy hodges said 'she stands with her somoli community...', and the facist leftist Jacob Frey has torn down the memorial to her death, saying 'hate has no place in Minneapolis'. So we can't count on MNPD or the government](http://archive.is/g0z9t)  
-[Will the FBI help? You mean the FBI that did such a stand up job in vegas? Or the FBI that did a stand up job in Pulse Night Club? Or the FBI that makes up dossiers to frame presidents? Or the FBI Obama neutered from going after islamic terrorists](http://archive.is/WPjfb)  
-[How bout DHS? Nah they scrubbed their somoli muslim records as ordered by OBAMA](http://archive.is/iOm0s)  
-[But what about stadium security? Oh you mean the ex cia assassins company G4S, that were involved in child trafficking, human traficking, pedophilia, mass murders, and false flags? Dont count on it.](http://archive.is/hZgxp)  
  
So what about the visitors safety? Well lets break it down, the MNPD will shoot you in the head if you call them for help, the Minneapolis local government is too concerned with virtue signalling, FBI is too busy trying to overthrow our duly elected president, DHS doesn't think islamic terrorism even exists, and the stadium security, G4S, seems to help its employees get away with pedophilia, trafficking, and mass murder. Superbowl LII is the perfect storm for a terrorist attack. If you go to superbowl be careful, be aware, dont let them kill my eagles.
