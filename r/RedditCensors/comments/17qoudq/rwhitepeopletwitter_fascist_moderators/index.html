My banned response: "Fixed it: Why are are Republicans obsessed with saving human lives"

OP link: https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/s/08BGx1qpiK

r/WhitePeopleTwitter is a super Left echo chamber that censors all others. 

I was immediately permanently banned for such a mild response?!? 

Some Reddit moderators are out of control! 

Ironically, the moderator called me a fascist as they ban people that don't have the same view as they do. Their action is a perfect example of fascism.</div>

> From 1776 until the mid-1800s abortion was viewed as socially unacceptable; however, abortions were not illegal in most states. During the 1860s a number of states passed anti-abortion laws. Most of these laws were ambiguous and difficult to enforce. After 1860 stronger anti-abortion laws were passed and these laws were more vigorously enforced.</div>

    <div class="md">In the 1700s the scientific and religious communities (not entirely separate) widely believed in the concept of "preformation," which stated, essentially, that all species had been made by God at the time of Creation, and animals "growing" was simply the unfolding of preformed parts. 

In the late 1800s Americans popularly believed that "rain follows the plow," the idea that farming a particular plot of land made it more likely for it to rain in that area. 

I still don't understand your point. Perhaps if you constructed some kind of argument involving the morality for or against abortion there would be more to address.</div>

    <div class="md">"Republicans obsessed with saving human lives" is one of the stupidest takes ever. The Republican party consistently vote against things that would save human lives, issues like gun control and health care for example.  

Also, you seem to fundamentally misunderstand what fascism is. When viewed through the lens of a rational critique of politics, the broad consensus is that fascism is a right-wing position.

Having said that, a permanent ban does seem a little heavy handed.</div>

    <div class="md">Gun control which creates greater restrictions on who can get a gun, and what type of gun can absolutely save lives. Also, the idea that guns keep people safe is just plain wrong. Studies have repeatedly shown that people who own guns are actually at an increased risk of homicide.

[Gun Ownership as a Risk Factor for Homicide in the Home
- Arthur L. Kellermann et al. ](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199310073291506) Conclusion: Rather than confer protection, guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.

[Homicide and suicide risks associated with firearms in the home: A national case-control study - Douglas J. Wiebe](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0196064403002567) Conclusion: Having a gun at home is a risk factor for adults to be shot fatally (gun homicide) or commit suicide with a firearm.

As for healthcare, pretty much every developed nation in the world does a much better job of it than America. The major reason for this is obstruction by the GOP in response to corporate lobbying. Healthcare would be simple if they were obsessed with saving human lives.</div>

    <div class="md">I appreciate your last sentence..the purpose of my post is not to discuss abortion, but to point out that reddit moderators ARE censoring people that have opposing views. That should not be allowed. Read the moderators response calling me a fascist while they are using their own power to censor

The moderator is acting as a dictator controlling opposition. With one button push, silenced.

The word "fascist" itself is thrown around by those in actual power to silence others. It is well known that Reddit leans heavily Left and many on the right give examples of censorship. I've been banned many times for giving my honest thought. I do not call people names or ridicule or hate. The irony that I point out is that the moderator did all those things against me just because they have a different opinion. There needs to be a way to report a moderator and have an impartial group review those reports. The moderators have too much power and wield it with impunity.

From Mirriam-Webster definition of fascism:

1
often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition
2
: a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control</div>

    <div class="md">What do you mean moderators have too much power? They have control over their space, nothing more. If someone was in my home spouting off racist bigoted nonsense I would be well within my rights to kick them out. That's not censorship or an abuse of power. The same can be said for a subreddit. You are not owed a platform on someone else's space. If you take issue with that then your recourse is to start your own subreddit and run it any way you choose.

It's probably worth pointing out that making abortion illegal amounts to state enforced pregnancy and that fits your definition of fascism much better than your example with the mod. I can't speak for that mod but I imagine what they are referring to is your apparent support of that particular fascist viewpoint.</div>

    <div class="md">Inside your car is private, but yet it is still legal for me to record you in your car because you are in public. 

The subreddit was and is open to the public with rules for which I joined and did not break any of those rules. Authoritarianism is probably the best description. 

It's always the party that is doing the Censorship that thinks it is not censoring. People feel a false sense of moral superiority such that they don't think the rules apply to them.</div>

    <div class="md">So, if the moderator banned you right now for something you said during our above conversation, you would be, "I'm ok with it. The moderator can ban me at any moment just because they want to." Gotcha!</div>

    <div class="md">Yup! Then I’d make my own half-assed censorship sub and wait for everyone who got banned for bullshit from this one to join. 

That’s how Reddit works.</div>

    <div class="md">The key difference is in the real world, the stores donot do it. reddit moderators do. What use is Community Guidelines if they are ignored? A society without rules is doomed. 

A reddit sub echo chamber of hate is not good for society. Since reddit is VERY liberal, conservative echo chambers are banned while the liberal ones are left open. I think left and right should be allowed free speech.  You should be standing up for all. One day you will be on the other end.</div>
