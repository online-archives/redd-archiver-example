    <div class="md">I really enjoy the mods comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/avru0y/dude_has_taste_slapped_out_of_his_mouth_for/ehhy2uo):

&gt;It's not that hard to understand guys. Don't say words that you have no right to say and hurt and demean a whole population of people. This subreddit is a cesspool sometimes and it's so sad.

Yeah guys. You're all so stupid. It's not hard to understand. One day we'll all realize we're just a bunch of idiots and these mods are here to make sure we know how to think. In the meantime, they're going to lock threads and just let us know what we did wrong.

Mods also apparently didn't want you to see this comment:

&gt;What a fucking lunatic. Physically assaulting someone just for saying nlgger, he should feel ashamed.
&gt;Also, fun fact: Reddit shadowremoved my first comment where I didn't censor nlgger.

That's right. Calling someone crazy for physically assaulting someone over a word and saying they should feel ashamed is not something those mods wanted you to see.

That's dumb and he shouldn't be such a little bitch about discussions, but the day reddit as a whole starts accepting that two wrongs do not, in fact, make a right is the day 99.9% of the user base has clearly quit. </div>

    <div class="md">What's sad is that people care more about a dude who most likely needed a few slaps. Some people just need to be handled physically it's sad how weak people are these days when it comes to a little physical violence. Its not that big of a deal. I'm not saying all problems need to be handled with back hands and jabs but when the situation calls for it such as here chill out and let it sort its self out. 

But yes the mod(s) are wrong for locking the thread smh.</div>
