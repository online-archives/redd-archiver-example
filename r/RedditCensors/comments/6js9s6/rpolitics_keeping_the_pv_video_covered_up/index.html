    <div class="md">Yeah, you can look through my account if you'd like, I have no need for a throwaway, I come into discussions like these for a reason.

OKeefe is also being sued for misrepresentation, his Project Veritas videos became an absolute laughing stock online as he hyped the end of the Dem party.

How in the fuck would a Medical Producer (who I don't believe works for the FBI, let alone deals with any journalistic tasks of the Russia case) be able to speak, let alone deny all of the allegations being investigated by the FBI? Cmon man.

Calling other people shills because they want to have an intelligent, and open conversation about disagreements will never lead to anything. 

Edit: Soooo credible!

Cool, that's great and all, but I can't seem to get an answer on this.  Regardless of OKeefe's reputation, how does he get people to admit to incriminating stuff on hidden camera?  Are they role playing?  Is it CGI?  Maybe he has some type of advanced hologram technology?  Super realistic masks and voice changers?

&gt;How in the fuck would a Medical Producer (who I don't believe works for the FBI, let alone deals with any journalistic tasks of the Russia case) be able to speak, let alone deny all of the allegations being investigated by the FBI? Cmon man.

What?  That's not the point.  The point is that he is in the meetings with the most powerful people in the company, and he has insight on how they run the company.  I would be surprised if the janitor or the new guy in the mailroom, didn't know how biased and manipulative the company is.

&gt;Calling other people shills because they want to have an intelligent, and open conversation about disagreements will never lead to anything. 

Do you also say that to people from the anti Trump side, who accuse anyone with a different opinion of being a Russian or a bot?  You may even do that too (I don't do the whole digging through a person's comment history thing), was just curious because that never seems to be the case.

&gt;Edit: Soooo credible!

I don't know if it's wise for your "side" to call out credible sources, since the majority of your talking points come from blatantly biased sources that cite unverifiable info from unnamed sources.</div>

I thought it was going to be interesting and wasn't sure what PV video meant. 
 
PV gets an immediate downvote due to their history of heavily editing videos to make it seem like the person "caught on film" was saying the exact opposite of what they actually said (after the unedited video eventually comes out). </div>

    <div class="md">No, THEY don't. 
 
The only reason we got the unedited ACORN video was because it was subpoena'd in a lawsuit. 
 
Upon watching the unedited video of the sting ACORN video, they dropped all charges and later James O'Keefe was charged and settled for $100,000 and an apology. 
 
We still don't have most of the unedited videos and they don't release them. Literally the only reason we know the ACORN one was complete bullshit was because of a lawsuit.

    <div class="md">That was the stick that they went after him with, yes. 
 
Apparently it was literally the only thing that they could get him on (a private civil charge) because the CA DA made the mistake of giving him immunity from state prosecution in exchange for the unedited video and audio. 
 
He settled with the CA Acorn employee $100,000 and issued him an apology as part of the settlement because he used editing to make it seem like he was a willing participant in trafficking underage girls which got him fired and smeared in the media, despite the fact the person was innocent and also immediately contacted the police to report O'Keefe. </div>

    <div class="md">No ... ACORN was exonerated by multiple investigations, including Republican investigations in Republican controlled states.  
  
James O'Keefe was full of shit. 
  
You know in AMA's sometimes when someone asks an actress a question like "Would you consider doing a sequel?" 
  
And the actress responds with "Yes" 
 
And then the original person edits their post to say "Would you consider doing ANAL in a porn video?" 
 
That's basically what O'Keefe did. He took ACORN employees answers and spliced different questions before them. </div>

    <div class="md">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACORN_2009_undercover_videos_controversy#cite_note-Salon2010Madden-7
   
Specifically about them changing their questions: "Giles and O'Keefe lied to engender compassion, but then edited their statements from the released videos."  This came from the CA investigation where they exchanged immunity for the unedited CA tapes. (only instance where we have the full unedited video/audio)  
 
The wikipedia entry has 138 sources linked in it. 
  
They lied about wearing pimp costumes, they lied about whether ACORN employees actually helped them (in Philadelphia), some of the ACORN employees played along (like in CA and Philadelphia) in order to get as much information as possible and then immediately reported it to the police. 
 
In Philly O'Keefe claimed the employees were helping them. He released audio of him asking questions and made it seem like they were aiding and abetting his criminal prostitution ring. Keefe claimed they were 100% onboard with helping them. But the police report, the fact they called the police on him while he was there and Keefe's unwillingness to release the unedited versions kind of makes him a fucking liar. 
  
In reality the ACORN employees in Philly called the police, made a police report and had the police escort them out of the building. 
 
Don't get me wrong, some of the ACORN employees did say things that were inappropriate. Some of them were specifically in order to get more information and then later they reported it all to the police, but I don't know if all of them were. 
 
But literally every investigation cleared the ACORN employees of anything criminal. The worst ACORN "offenders" literally reported everything to the police immediately after - and their police reports stated that they played along for more information - all well before the videos came out. </div>

    <div class="md">You're kidding right? Do you own stock in CNN? I'm betting it's been a really bad week for you already. You are making yourself look silly, and destroying any personal credibility you might have. 

The facts:

Trump has never been under investigation. 

CNN had to retract a story on Saturday. 

Three employees resigned over it. 

Harvard study shows a 93% negative bias on CNN against Trump. 

Stop letting CNN make you look like a fool, have some self respect. Can you come up with a single plausible scenario in which the producer saying Zucker told them to stop reporting on the Paris Accord and back to Russia could be taken out of context? Given the overwhelming factual evidence, it doesn't matter if it were taken out of context, CNN is worse than PV, and the race isn't even close. 

You are defending people who don't deserve to be defended. They've been conning the public for nearly three decades. They've been named in more lawsuits than PV ever has. They're known to discriminate. They are THE joke. 

PV isn't really breaking any news, we've known this, they are only confirming what the evidence has already demonstrated. They aren't actually bringing anything new to the table. 

I know it must suck being a liberal right now, Trump has never been under investigation, Hillary, Bernie, Lynch, and the Obama DoJ are under investigation. The world's been turned upside down for liberals, but you don't need to be a sheep any longer. </div>

    <div class="md">Doesn't matter, the supporting facts are enough to substantiate the claim. It is more crazy that you are attempting to discredit the video based on a separate and unrelated case, and ignoring the mountain of evidence supporting the claim. 

Based on your flawed logic, everything CNN has said or published should be discredited because they had to retract a story. That is how your logic follows, correct? If not, why do you give CNN a pass and not PV? The only explanation is that one says what you want to hear, the other doesn't. Isn't the hallmark of journalism saying things the people don't want to hear? If that is the case, PV is definitely journalism for you. </div>

In the ACORN case they got employees to repeat hypothetical questions / situations and then edited it to make it look like they said it as fact. 
 
I'm sorry, but when someone lies so blatantly through editing in the past, I'm going to completely disregard their newest project without even looking into it.

    <div class="md">Are you that dense or just that stubborn? I gave you plenty of FACTUAL reasons to believe the PV video. Besides the fact that if you truly cared you'd look up the unedited video, it's out there. I'm sorry but you are too hilarious not to respond to. Let me get this straight, the fact that Comey said that Trump has never been under investigation isn't enough proof to believe a video that says Trump has never been under investigation and they have made it up for ratings? The former FBI directors testimony corroborates the video evidence, and you don't want to believe it? I'm not even entertaining the argument you make because it's irrelevant. 

All known evidence points to the video being accurate! No evidence points to it being inaccurate. Stop lying to yourself man, have some fucking dignity. Stop carrying water for the loser left. </div>

    <div class="md">I don't need to, I have the evidence that corroborates the story, I don't need the video to not look stupid. You need the video to be false or you will look dumb as fuck, so you have a vested interest in disproving it, I will just rely on Comey’s testimony, and the fact that CNN had to retract a story, and fired (resigned) three employees. 

Nice try though. The burden of proof is on you. </div>

    <div class="md">Why? I have substantiated my claim, I am willing to let it go to the jury now. I'm not arguing in an attempt to change your mind, I'm arguing for the couple dozen of people who read this and realize how terrible a point you've made. You have already demonstrated that you are beyond logic and reason, therefore there is no winning for you, but there are plenty of lurkers out there that I can convince. If you'd like to convince them I'd suggest you find the video and break down why it's incorrect, and you better find evidence of Russian involvement. </div>

I don't need the unedited video because there is plenty of on the record evidence that also shows that CNN are stone cold liars. I don't even need the PV video at all.

    <div class="md">Nice try. From USA Today's article:

"CNN says a clandestine video of one of the network's producers criticizing its coverage of President Trump is legitimate, further fraying an already strained relationship between the news network and the White House."

Even CNN admits its true, thinks they can shrug it off. They believe you are sheep and will swallow anything they sell you. </div>

    <div class="md">First off you moron, there is no need for the unedited video, as I pointed out to you earlier but you are not smart enough to understand, CNN has already said the PV video is legitimate. Why the fuck would we need the unedited video when the subject has already stipulated that its correct? 

This does not diminish the fact that the video is out there, whether you can locate it is up to how good you are. Finding it evidently won't change anything, as CNN agrees that the video is legitimate. But mouth breathers like you are so gullible it won't matter now will it? The truth is an area you can't operate in. </div>

Who released the video is completely irrelevant.  The damning evidence against CNN is overwhelming and undeniable.

These attempts to distract from that are pathetic and transparent.  Stop that now.</div>

See the ACORN video where it turned out it was almost 100% fabricated and resulted in all charges dropped against ACORN and James O'Keefe actually paying $100,000 and issuing an apology to the worker he completely misrepresented and slandered. 
 
He literally edited in different questions to make it look like the ACORN employee was willingly engaging in crimes.  
 
But they only found all that out after it was subpoena'd. </div>

    <div class="md">The answer is of course none of it. What bothered me the most was that between several the questions and when he answered the questions there's a Cut in the video. Why is there cut? If he directly answered the question that just got asked, then why was there a cut in the video?  Why was there a cut in the middle of the answer?  Those things bothered me. </div>

Edit: Since I'm getting down votes for (presumably) "fake news", here's [some more!](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/08/james-o-keefe-settlement-acorn) More recent, too...but I'm sure he's "grown up a lot since then", right?

Face it...this guy is garbage paid by trump to spread fake news. Not ONE of his videos has EVER passed the Smell Test. 

Edit 2: These down votes without replies are like sweet, sweet wine. Here's further evidence that [Project "Veritas" videos should NEVER be trusted!](http://www.snopes.com/2016/10/18/project-veritas-election-videos/)

    <div class="md">Since fuck face can't actually do anything but drool instead of present a valid argument to you, I'll try to explain why your opinion is wrong, or at least, isn't good.

Regardless of opinion on PV, it doesn't change the fact that a CNN official has outright stated that the whole Russia thing is practically baseless conjecture. Sure, the video is heavily edited, and yes, it would be great if we had the full thing unedited, but it didn't change what the guy said, nor did they crop the audio to make it look like he said something he didn't. </div>

    <div class="md">Thank you for responding in a civilized manner.   
I'll admit my personal bias clouds my opinion of anything that PV put out. I think his past makes him an untrustworthy source.  
That being said, there are only two reasonable conclusions any reasonable person can make right now about the situation.  
1. The DNC had a shit ton of emails leaked.  
2. The amount of illegitimate news that flowed throughout the election was insane.    
It should be the responsibility of congress to figure out how it happened and how to combat it in the future.  
If there anything amounting to any campaign colluding with a foreign country/illegal entity throughout this process, it should be prosecuted without mercy..  
Other than that, there is little anyone can claim to be concrete. </div>

    <div class="md">Agreed. If this whole Trump/Russia collusion situation does prove to be true, he should absolutely be removed from office. However, this whole video situation basically places a "Boy Who  Cried Wolf" effect on CNN and the case itself.

    <div class="md">Take all known evidence as a whole, including Comey's testimony, it doesn't really matter if PV is credible. The video provided, combined with the evidence at hand, lends to the credibility of the claim regardless of the source. We know from sworn testimony that the president has never been under investigation, that right there is enough to lend credibility to the idea that CNN is conning millions of people to push their ratings and narrative. 

I'd entertain your opinion more if the PV video were the only evidence of what CNN is doing, but taking everything on the whole, your opinion is most likely flat wrong. </div>

    <div class="md">Blanket statement: 24 hour news networks push a ratings first agenda.  CNN pushing a narrative that trump is a Russian conspirator drives rating from those disillusioned by the results of 2016 in the same way allowing trump's birtherism and the tea party rise did in 2008.  
I'm not condoning the behavior, but it does have a certain symmetry to it.  
I said this elsewhere but it bears repeating. I truly have no use for 24 hour news networks unless something big happens. I cannot fathom watching it on a nightly basis. How boring.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, and it makes sense as the Harvard study pointed out, FOX is the most fair and balanced, so they'd have more coverage of the Tea Party movement. The Tea Party was not a response to Obama however, they were a response to inept establishment Republicans. They did most of their work in primary elections. You could say they were against the Obama agenda, but so were the Republicans, they formed because establishment candidates were not doing anything to stop it. The Tea Party and Trump supporters have both formed as a response to Republicans, not Democrats. You will see them again in 2018, because the Republicans control everything and are getting nothing legislatively accomplished. A full repeal of O-care is the only thing that will stop it. </div>

    <div class="md">The left won't cooperate, and the right doesn't need to. It would be smart for the left to cooperate because the Republican constituents will never vote Democrat, and they will only vote in more conservative Republicans in the primary. 

If you notice what I said, I stated that 'statistically speaking' FOX was the most fair and balanced, with the cited Harvard Study. You'll find that my statement is technically correct, which is the best kind of correct. </div>

    <div class="md">PV has been known in the past for presenting partial truths as concrete facts and even outright fabrication of falsehoods as news. The problem with the video is because of his past, unless presented in it's entirety and independently verified I have to assume it's false/faked/not entirely true.  
It's not like I decided randomly he was a bad guy. He made that decision for me.</div>

    <div class="md">So the producer that is obviously in the video was in on the fabrication as well? Did you even watch it? It would appear that many of the deniers in here are just slagging it off without even looking at it. The guy plainly speaks about the absolute rubbish that CNN is passing off as news for the fucking paltry ratings above all else. That's all they care about. Keep your head in the sand, it doesn't bother me. Unless the producer is in on this then I can't see what could possibly be fake about it. </div>

    <div class="md">It depends on what you use it for. CNN as a television station is terrible. But generally I think that of all the news channels. They over analyze things and aren't interested in participating in long form investigative journalism. People that get get their opinions exclusively from news commentators are brainless sheep incapable of thinking for themselves. 
But if I need to know about a huge news story (like a disaster somewhere in the world) they're as good as anything.

Lol

Are you actually forgetting Brazile and Creamer?

What about Wassermann-Schultz? 

His coverage of the emails scandal was instrumental in the removal or the head of the DNC and the neutering of Clintons campaign.

You are living in an alternate reality.

Don't forget CNN saying;

&gt;You are not allowed to read Clinton's emails

Lol</div>

    <div class="md">The people at Planned Parenthood said those things too, but they were so cut up that what made into the video was completely changed. I find it hard to trust a con man who has done this multiple times. Like I said though, it doesn't matter because people will believe it and then when it comes out down the line that the whole context and meaning was completely different, nobody will care. </div>

If PV said "The world is a roughly round shape" would you proclaim "Ha! What a Liar, like we can trust anything he says!" ? 

Thing is, if this came from literally any other source likely to report it, you would attacking the source. You can't change what was said on video, and who said it. </div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, I'm going to stop you right there. A person's credibility is always going to be considered prior to making a judgment about the factual nature of a statement.  
Also the second part of your argument is verifiably false. If PV says things that are commonly known to be true I won't pull a 180. It's when they create a new narrative using information that can't be readily verified that they're going to lose my faith in what they're saying. And because he has a history of massaging the truth, I give him a smaller leash before I nope out. </div>

    <div class="md">Your an anon. You have no credibility. Ergo I have absolutely no reason to listen to anything you have to say let alone read it because you have no credibility.  

Btw I heard CNN just got another hot leak from an anonymous unverified source. You may want to go check out the new narrative of the week from their super credible anonymous source familiar with someone's thinking. It's totes legit.  

Meanwhile, the rest of us won't be acting like audio/video evidence of a producer on CNN straight up admitting they were pushing for WW3 with the worlds second largest nuclear superpower for ratings, doesn't exist.</div>
