    <div class="md">Here are some of the comments that the mods did not want you to see:

&gt;It was posted multiple times earlier and was getting censored by the mods for a large part of the day yesterday

.

&gt;Why would they censor this?

.

&gt;Because mods on news subs censor articles that make Islam look bad

.

&gt;The mods regularly behave in an unethical manner and there is no accountability to them because removing them Would require more mod work from the admins which would drive up the costs associated with running reddit. It’s a perverse incentive that allows unethical or out and out corrupt mods to run major subs.

.

&gt;Indeed, and then you have some people 'moderating' 1500 or more subreddits. This site has been evolving into a perverse joke for years.

.

&gt;Just like the story of the elderly Sikh man assukter by teens. Was gaining traction but once the teens were found to be black kids in hoodies the story was pretty much scrubbed from Reddit.

&gt;It appears on r/BayArea but but threads are locked.

&gt;One of the more “aqueous” admins there is borderline abusive in banning redditors who offend his sensibilities.

&gt;This entire site is a politics sham. From T_D gaming r/all to the mods of r/politics, everyday users get the bullshit from both ends of the spectrum.

.

&gt;We should be demanding action from the admins. The way things are right now are totally fucked.

.

&gt;Or anything that might contradict the narrative that all school shooters are white males

.

&gt;Jesus Christ finally people are getting this. Why is every other religion fair game for criticism but Islam is protected so much on this site? I don’t get it. No entity , religious, corporate or government should ever be free of criticism. Critiques can generate growth.

.

&gt;Pulse shooting really hit home just how censored this sub is.

.

&gt;Funny thing about that .... I've submitted this story a few times and noticed it keeps being deleted by the moderators with a "NSFB" tag. NSFB = not safe for brand.

.

&gt;It's /r/news.

&gt;Don't you remember the Pulse fiasco on this sub? This is why you can't rely on Reddit as your only new source.</div>

A Muslim shot up a gay nightclub, then Obama put the assholes dad in the front row. 
I believe the asshole (the shooter, just to be clear.. since there are a few assholes in this story) had his gf accomplish leave the country or go missing for quite some time.

The whole thing was domestic Muslim terrorism, but ole apologetic Obama didnt want to admit it</div>
