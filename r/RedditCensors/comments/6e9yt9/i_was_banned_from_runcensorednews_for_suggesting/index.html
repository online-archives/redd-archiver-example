    <div class="md">Here's why he banned you:

&gt;Rules canary and appeals:

&gt;If asked by a moderator to read the rules, include the below at the end of your reply. This is a way for us to know that you've actually read the rules as requested, which isn't always a given.

&gt;115 141 153 145 40 151 164 40 115 141 143 40 164 157 156 151 147 150 164 56

&gt;If you're banned, you may submit an appeal via modmail. Before submitting an appeal you are requested to re-read these rules in full, respecting the rules canary. Appeals that do not contain the rules canary will be assumed to have been sent without reading the rules and will be ignored. Likewise, appeals that are worded in an aggressive or uncivil manner will not receive a reply.

It's like a default thing they do. He doesn't care that you actually didn't break any rules, he cares that you didn't link the number string at the bottom of the page.

I read the rules and didn't see it because it's hidden under the **Sitewide Rules** section. Everyone already knows Reddit's rules so I'm sure everyone just stops there. It's clear they put it in that section intentionally to gotcha people with it and cover up their mod abuse.</div>

    <div class="md">I think you're confused. I've already read reddit's own rules. My point is that they put the canary in a portion of the text that isn't relevant to the sub's own rules. 

Typically you'd insert the canary into the actual rules, not an irrelevant subsection. </div>

    <div class="md">The same mod just banned me. He posted some ridiculous shit about blacks and white having inherently different IQs. When I called him out for lying because his sources didn't say anything about that he immediately permanently banned me.

It's pretty retarded to expect people to read the the irrelevant content of your rules page for no reason, but I guess that's what you get from people who make shit up to justify their racism.

inb4 they ban me here too.

Edit: Oh look they removed this post! Gotta hide the mod abuse! CENSOR CENSOR CENSOR!</div>
