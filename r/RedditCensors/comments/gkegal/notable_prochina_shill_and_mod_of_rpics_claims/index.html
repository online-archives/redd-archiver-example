    <div class="md">The reason they do this is because there are a lot of account farmers that create accounts by the hundred and flood reposts and low effort comments in order to get karma, which are then auctioned off to spammers, shills, and the like.

But they should be able to tell if you're actually participating and getting karma normally. It's not really suspicious to have a new account do well. People make new accounts for legitimate reasons all the time. New users join up, people who are often already familiar with social media, and do so because they want to participate in something that interests them or that they're passionate about - so it's no surprise that they'd be well received when they start commenting.</div>

    <div class="md">As I proved above, this isn't true.

There's no rule that says that you can't post a cool pic you found somewhere else on the internet.  They made up that rule on the fly.

An account that is younger than mine is able to post freely.

I was even able to post without a problem not too long ago, until I posted an article criticizing China then suddenly all of my posts on /r/pics went to the spam filter.

So it's clear what they do is they are shadowbanning me based on my activity elsewhere.</div>

That's exactly what I thought.

Brand new users generally don't post pics other people took in subreddits unless they are alts or karma farmers (or both) usually to establish credibility on a new account.</div>
