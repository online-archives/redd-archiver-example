It's not entirely your fault, the American mainstream media is among the most dishonest and manipulative in world history (that's not hyperbole), but enough alternative resources exist that no one has justification for being *that* misinformed.

    <div class="md">I'm more burnt out than anything. China has its myriad of human rights abuses, and attempts at censorship worldwide (with corporations cowtowing to them because profits are more important than morality), the stupidity between Israel and Palestine, Russia looking like they wanna invade Ukraine. SO much polarization on issues (which I'll admit I'm guilty of too, so I appreciate y'all pointing it out). I'm getting so done on the human race 🙃

Everyone lies about it all, can't trust mainstream media, can't trust governments, getting to the point I wish we'd all just blow ourselves up and leave the planet for the next dominant species.</div>

    <div class="md">So my issue with this isn't defending his comparison. I think any comparison meant to appeal to emotions is absurd and illogical.

My issue is that they let comparisons of Trump and Hitler on that subreddit. Posting things with right wing dogma and comparing it to Nazi Germany. Mind you I say this as a liberal, someone who hated Trump, and would never vote for him.

So to summarize. My issue is that it's inconsistent banning. He's making a comparison you might not like. But from where I'm sitting, that subreddit allowed that same door to be opened. He is merely walking through it. Then receiving inconsistent punishment for it.</div>

    <div class="md">The problem is not whether or not that action is being done it's who you are stating is doing it. Jews does not equal Israel. Israel are perpetuating these crimes not "the Jews." 

Calling the actions of Israel the actions of Jews allows people to call it anti-semitism. This prevents real critique of the government under a guise that it's hate speech. It also has an inverse effect of allowing anti-semites to spew hate speech under the guise of government criticism. 

This is why a separation of Church and State is necessary.</div>

    <div class="md">I condemn the actions of Israel against the people of Palestine, including but not limited to the displacement and genocide of a people.

Now that's out of the way, this is exactly my point of anti-semites hiding behind the guise of anti-Israeli. Your point is mute when your realize that there are Jewish people all over the world with zero affiliation with Israel. Israel's actions don't reflect all Jewish people opinions or morals. 

You might not realize it yet but you're proving my church and state "argument." Israel is a great example of what happens when those two aren't separated, I'm sure we can agree it's bad. 

Also I googled this for you...

    <div class="md">If the Palestinians put down their weapons they'd all be herded off to the ghetto or worse. It's a very complicated matter because no side is all wrong or all right but the Israeli Jews are not going to be wiped out by a couple rockets made in a garage. The only thing keeping them from full on wiping out Palestinians is the loss of international support and how the rest of the region would respond.</div>

Idgaf what the truth of the matter is (in terms of who is fucking who in the middle east). This is a valid post on this subreddit because the mods of worldnews are censoring it and applying their rules inconsistently. That's what we should be focused on.

Mind you, this isn't the first time that's happened. Worldnews us notorious for censoring and narrative pushing.</div>

    <div class="md">Nice ban, deserved 100%. If jews like anything like nazis, palestinians/arabs wouldn't have existed since 1948. 

Is there some group of people in israel that hate arabs? yes ofcorse but doesn't define all israelis. Wish you could say the same about arabs tho, who vote and celebrate the death of a Israeli civilian.</div>

Also, Israel's nazi-like activities have escalated over the last decade... so your comparison to 1948 isn't accurate</div>

    <div class="md">No, i'm saying that majority of Israeli's don't want war or hate arabs, but the other side does. Which is shown in celebration of killing of civilians, on one side it's condemned and people are locked up for it while on the other it's celebrated and families of martyr's or killers are rewarded with money. It's not a blanketed statement, it's reflected in the society.</div>
