    <div class="md">Another way to look at this is.... People don't give a fuck if they are told a little bit of char can contribute to cancer because EVERYTHING around you does the same thing. Ever been to Cali? Everything has stickers that say "Cali identifies this item as having chemicals that can cause cancer." Everything! 

Better to just enjoy your food and stop worrying about the little things. And I bet the mods see so many people posting about cancer they are sick of it. I would be.

If your afraid then don't eat it. Leave other people enjoy their food.</div>

    <div class="md">They really need to have levels on those labels. If regularly consuming a given product increases my lifetime risk of cancer by 1%, that's probably enough that I should be informed. If it's 10%, I should seriously consider not using the product. If it's 100%, the product should probably be banned.

However, the threshold for the CA labels is one excess case per 100,000 people over a 70-year lifetime, and there's only one level. If one product increases your lifetime risk of cancer by 0.001% and another increases it by 100%, they get the same label. Imagine if a product had a label that said "will definitely get you sick" with no way to tell whether it was the common cold or smallpox. Or "you will definitely be shot" and you don't know if it's a Nerf dart or a cannonball.

I did just learn that the same bill prohibits all chemicals on the list from being released into drinking water, though, so kudos to CA for that.</div>
