    <div class="md">Yes I might come off as kind of a dick, and might be one, but I think we should all call out bullshit:



*Good god is it so hard to make an honest headline???? Jfc....this is SCIENCE. NOT FUCKING NATIONAL ENQUIRER.

The study says nothing about verification of communication, they simply isolated some genetic sequences.

That's awesome! And they totally could be using them to communicate, but THIS DOES NOT SHOW THAT.

MODS - are you even professional scientists? Do you even care about truth and the scientific method?

This sub is disgusting and pathetic. Every other post is complete bullshit in a time when we desperately need actual evidence and data driven science.

Do something good mods, feel good about yourself - fix up this trash sub to be a beacon of real science and rigorous academic research. Not a freaking tabloid.

Ok rant over. Jesus you guys suck.


Edit: Does anyone know the names of the mods for r/science? I want to tag them because I just went through the posts up and it is a God. Damned. Travesty. We could actually have something pure and good, like real science, but instead we have consumerist, political, and vested interest propaganda - THAT DOESN'T EVEN USE VALID MODELS OR DATA.

IF ANYONE IS AN ACTUAL SCIENTIST PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. Disgusting.

Do you honestly stand by your subreddit?*</div>

    <div class="md">IT'S SO FUCKING RICH. Like they try to proclaim they're here to defend vulnerable groups of people, but then allow a post where millions make fun of mentally troubled individuals, (like that poor kid having a breakdown at the hotel) or poor people (like the troubled lady being used for clout the other day), or people fighting for rights, or whatever.

They do not give a fuck this is a disgusting, hypocritical, propaganda-laden, amoral cesspool.

Is there any way it can be fixed?</div>
