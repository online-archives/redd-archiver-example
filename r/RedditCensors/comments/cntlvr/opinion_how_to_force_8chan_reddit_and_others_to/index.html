    <div class="md">Turned out that asshat was a rabid leftist Antifa goon.

Not so great for the corrupt MSMedia's agenda.

Something else you won't hear about... the El Paso asshat was a Democrat, and so fanatical about universal basic income, they were pissed off at their own Dem party for their open border policy.

So much so, this half Jewish, half Latino dude wanted to kill as many illegal immigrants as possible.  For socialism.

Both of them were leftists.  The El Paso one was a terrorist. Violence with a far left political agenda, as is the case in the VAST majority of such violent, authoritarian crimes.</div>

    <div class="md">There is zero comparison between a huge, abusive, monopolistic, cencor happy, politically bigoted forum like reddit (FB, Youtube, twitter, etc)

and a site like the chans, that freely allows (almost) all ideas and ideals equally.  

The huge Shareblue controlled social media giants are horribly abusive. Anything you can say against a site like 8chan, goes 1000x for them.

8chan doesn't censor anything that is not strictly illegal, as it damn well should be.

reddit &amp; Co cencor basically anything right of Marx, and allow their rabid leftist darling subs to spew daily hate speech, real promotion of physical violence against their normal, every day political opponents. They are at war with America.</div>
