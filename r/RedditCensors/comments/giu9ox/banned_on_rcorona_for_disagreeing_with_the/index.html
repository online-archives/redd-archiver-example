https://old.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/gioh4j/texas_governor_says_no_one_needs_to_wear_a_mask/fqgnu19/

My comment:

I live in Texas - if you're worried, stay inside.

If you want to wear a mask, wear a mask.

If you're worried about the doctors and nurses, they don't have to go outside either.

Nobody does.

The only real question is why people who are staying inside would care about this at all.

"*BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU AND WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOU!*"

Lol, even if that was true (hint: [it's not](https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/g7l5ta/a_friend_offering_some_advice_to_the_covid/)), we simply don't care. 

You do your thing - stay inside - we'll do ours.

Why in the world is this controversial?

**Edit: I get tired of arguing with you guys while throttled (6 minutes between comments), but [I found a video of you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcUAG6t5aN8)**

**Edit 2: Replying to the slowboats below me here since I'm not waiting 8 minutes to post another comment.**

&gt;Some people can't stay inside 100% of the time

Nobody* can stay inside 100% of the time. 

We don't even do this to prisoners because it's considered a rights violation.

&gt;It's about the collective public health

Ahh yes, destroy the rights of the individual for the collective. Pretty much every evil ideology has used this argument - you'd get along with Margaret Sanger and all the other fun eugenicists.

**Edit 3: Responding to AhDunWantIt who has difficulty sleeping because of me.**

&gt;Essential workers and immunosuppressed people like my mother HAVE to go outside for things like doctors appointments, and your unwillingness to help make the environment they are in so much more dangerous. Wearing a cloth mask only protects those around you, not yourself. This selfishness is why I cannot sleep at night and worry for my parents.

Your parents will never run into me since I'm avoiding the doctor's office like the plague.

Honestly, it's more dangerous for them there. That's what should keep you up at night.

In fact, just get them a hazmat suit and you can sleep like a baby.

Don't blame me for your shitty sleep habits - I don't blame you or your parents for mine.

**Edit 4: Responding to FuckenGruven:**

&gt;You can't spread obesity, or smoking, or drinking, or drugs, or diabetes, or sunburn. You can spread coronavirus.

So the new suggestion is that anyone who has a communicable disease is not allowed to receive medical care.

I don't know where you guys come up with these great arguments, but keep them coming because they're hilarious.

&gt;If wearing a mask is such an infringement upon your rights, can you explain to me why nobody is up in arms about having to wear pants when they go outside? What's the difference?

He makes a good point here: people cover their genitalia when they're outside, why aren't they willing to wear a helmet and knee pads when they walk down the street?

Why aren't we adopting middle eastern garb here in America under penalty of law?

These are some good questions, but I think the answers are pretty obvious:

You don't have to wear pants outside.

You can wear shorts - heck, you can get away with a speedo if you feel so inclined.

So, let's try again with your question:

"Why must we cover our genitalia in public"?

I never endorsed that law - if you can sway the majority, best of luck 😉

**Edit 5: Responding to jus6j**

&gt;Dude it’s so fucking simple to wear fabric over your mouth and nose to keep others safe when you have to leave your house. Grow the fuck up. No shit we are trying to stay inside. Go do some MDMA, you empathy lacking prick.

As we all know, fabric over the mouth completely blocks and prevents Covid-19.

The ONLY reason it's spread across the entire world is because people aren't wearing t-shirts on their heads.

Many claps for this brave soul - unfortunately, IMO anyone without a hazmat suit is being dangerously irresponsible.

**Edit 6: Responding to i_tyrant who went straight for the ad hominem with a usernamechecksout as he ironically insults my own (lol):**

&gt;Downvote and move on, he's a shitty Texan and person and you've got better things to do.

You've got better things to do than troll someone's post history in an effort to discredit them, but i_tyrant doesn't, because he's not a "shitty Texan."

I'd find you guys funny if I didn't think it was leaning more towards evil.

**Edit 7: Responding to zinoozy:**

&gt;Well by your logic the economy will be f*cked forever. Scared and sick people stay inside! Let me live my life! (That's you). Ok so let's say they do that, do you think life will be just great? You think the economy will bounce back? You need those people to come out and spend their money and keep things running. Your proposed solution only creates more problems.

The economy will recover in states that aren't full of cowards *coughs*.

The states that are full of cowards will either come out of their hidey holes or crumble into despair.

I hope you guys figure it out.

**Edit 8: Responding to Pink3y3 (gross, don't spread your disease please):**

&gt;This comes off as so defensive it's past cringy.
