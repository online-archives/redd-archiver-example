    <div class="md">They permanently banned me for this post on their sticky:

"I am pro vax and mask, and completely believe it's a serious disease.

Censorship is pathetic and disgusting, and always backfires. I'd love to say more about how I actually feel about this post but it'd probably be deleted.

You power hungry mods have destroyed reddit by the inhibition of open discourse. People in echo chambers are far more dangerous than people allowed to have discussions with those that have better information.

You think this will stop them? It will make almost every one of them double down.

If you actually want to stop the misinformation and fight covid, go talk to them. It's not easy, and that's why you'd rather wield your inevitably damaging power trips, but it's the way to actually fix this.

You battle misinformation with information, not censorship. If you do otherwise, at some point the power will be abused when it really matters, as it already has on this site concerning any number of issues, not the least being politics."</div>

    <div class="md">The vast majority of even the vaccinated see this clarly as the massive abuse that it is.

Them outright banning such a reasonable message shows they have zero interst in anything but pushing propaganda and disinformation.

Authoritarian tyrants, and the big powermods pushing this crap are most likely on the take from one drug company or other. Their shills are crawling all over reddit. :-(

Good on ya for trying there Mr. Attends. And for sharing the result.</div>

    <div class="md">I have the vaccine and I'm kind of worried about it. Never in my life has a government tried so hard to shut down discussion of something...unless it was something that they didn't want the public to know "for their own good" like the whole snow den thing. Media lied for them, and so many people bought it. 

But then... Maybe we just didn't know how much they lied and kept from us before.</div>

    <div class="md">That's what I hope. From things I have seen I think it is relatively safe for most people, with a higher chance of some nasty side effects than the FDA usually allows in a drug. Kind of like back in the old phen/fen days when doctors were prescribing drugs they didn't know enough about and a lot of people now have life long heart problems because of it. But... Money.

The truth is its an experimental drug. We don't know the long term side effects because we've never used it before. But it does work in lowering symptoms for the beer bug. So what do you do with an experimental drug we don't know the symptoms for? Force every human in the world to get it, apparently, regardless of their risks from the beer bug. 

Things are messed up.</div>

    <div class="md">To preface, I'm also vaccinated. I would encourage anybody medically able to be as well. I do find the suppression of discourse on the topic concerning, however.

I'm going to sound like a fucking nutter, but the same thing happened with UFOs/UAPs. For 60 years, it was all swamp gas, flares and weather balloons. Now in the last 5, the US government has quietly admitted they exist, and that they have absolutely no fucking idea what they are.</div>

    <div class="md">Disappointed there are a few otherwise fun subs that have now declared themselves solidly against accurate science, and fully for drug company propaganda. 

RIP  /assholedesign - unsubscribed! There are always alternatives to any of these, so no real loss.

Nice they gave us a list of what subs have science denying cancermods running them. :-)

Though, the VAST majority of subs on that list are completely useless or downright abusive to begin with.</div>

    <div class="md">I was banned instantly for saying the following statement on that post

&gt;When we get another Trump-like figure in charge, I'm sure you all will   
be very happy to live in a society where dissent is censored by   
politicians and tech platforms for the "greater good"  

They're kind of proving the point. This post isn't even a violation of their rules, they're just suppressing dissent. They're in for a rude awakening if they think norms around suppressing unpopular opinions will never be used on their viewpoints, or truthful viewpoints. The creation of a society where censorship is the norm is way more dangerous on a fundamental level than even COVID. Here's a picture of the ban notice:
