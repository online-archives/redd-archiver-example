    <div class="md">I agree censorship is censorship, but the picture you're painting is that the democrats who run this site censor anti democrat sentiment, which is best exemplified by your quote "Never getting free speech on anything anti-democrat in this shit hole". In this case, it is evident that they are censoring a pro democrat narrative, which goes against your argument.

If you reply to this comment with anything that's not just apologising and admitting you were wrong, I'm going to act even dumber than you and see how you like it x</div>
