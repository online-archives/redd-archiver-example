    <div class="md">Well truth can be interesting at times. In the past 2 years I have been banned from several subs for making this simple statement: Not all muslims are terrorists, granted, but why are all terrorists muslims? Thats it. Trigger #1 for most reddit mods. No violence suggestions, threats, or other things. Just a question or statement of fact. Now alongside of being pro muslim, reddit has a Chinese financial interest at stake. All this within a 2 year span. What has happened in 2 years? How many subs have been banned and quarantined in that period? Coincidence? Yeah, right. This platform stinks of hidden agendas and thought control through censorship.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s funny because Reddit hates Christianity so much and talks so much shit about religion then defends Muslims, there is no doubt the shooting was horrific but Reddit handles it terribly, they instantly go to politicizing the deaths for their own agenda. The first thing I heard was that he is right wing but then when I went to go research myself I find out he hates trump and loves China and their policies. The people at r/politics are awful human beings. </div>

    <div class="md">There's a lot of unknowns here, and it looks like it could possibly be a false flag to advance their agenda in disarming the populace so they can't fight back against their government later when they really start to crack down on freedoms.

It WILL happen.

Even if this guy really was this VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF NON-ALIGNED ECO-FASCIST in reality, something about this just doesn't add up right.</div>

    <div class="md">Exactly. It seems so heavy handed I almost think that information could come out to really reverse the narrative. Recall they did the same thing with the Pulse NightClub attack. When it first happened it was all over, every sub, everywhere.. then they find out that it was a muslim that did it and just like that it was censored and removed. 


Im obviously not saying a muslim did this, but I am saying that when the crafted narrative shows cracks the entire thing falls down. They aren't appearing to allow any cracks to even form this time around.</div>
