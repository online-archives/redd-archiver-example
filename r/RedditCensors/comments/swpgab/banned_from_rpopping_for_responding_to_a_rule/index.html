    <div class="md">I'd advise you against using a comment remover/changer, because that is even more annoying than.. most of reddit and it will just seem very petty. It's kinda like throwing a temper tantrum.  
but if you want to..
removing all comments: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nuke-reddit-history (judging from the comments, only works if you don't use that cancer that is new reddit. The one with avatars and shit)  
can't find one to edit all comments tho</div>

    <div class="md">"The rules only apply when they apply to you." - my Dad 

He was explaining covert enforcement and plausible deniability. 

Basically it's easier to ask for forgiveness than get permission. Act like you've been doing (whatever) for a long time and implicate the people who let you if you actually have been doing it a long time. 

On the other hand of enforcement, never order your people to do something illegal. But order your people to "get the job done". You have no idea that they don't understand what they did was illegal and you've covered your ass for being intentionally ignorant and incompetent as a leader, but hey, you get results.</div>
