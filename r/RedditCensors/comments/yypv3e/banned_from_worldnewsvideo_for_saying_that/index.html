    <div class="md">Cause it’s disinformation, a type of psychological warfare. Not saying you realize it it’s disinfo, but  the only people trying to share that story are people that were tricked (you), and a bunch of paid Russian disinfo agents and their bots. So yeah weaponized disinfo needs to be moderated out. That being said that mod message is so pretentious sounding haha.</div>

    <div class="md">The part where Biden abused his power and changed policy to favor Jrs business deals in Ukraine. That’s what the scandal was about, nobody cared about Jr breaking any tax laws or a gun charge. You guys just keep changing whatever it is you were trying to find on Jrs laptop meanwhile democrat voters don’t really give a shit and pretty much assume Jr does have shady shit, and don’t care cause it had nothing to do with Biden Sr, the original point of the conspiracy.</div>

Hunter Biden was caught from it doing some shady things and he was caught being a go-between for his father in said laptop emails. Just because the truth hurts Biden does not make it disinformation, hiding it or lying about it is the real disinformation as social media and even the FBI tried to hide it till after the election.</div>

    <div class="md">Did you not see the line ("10% for the big guy" or question why hunter was on the board of berisma making lots of money when he had no experience or good reason to be on the board of a Ukrainian company? Oh, do you think when his dad as VP threatened to withhold guaranteed loans till Ukrain fired a prosecutor that had investigated the company his son was involved with was on the level?

Biden used his position as VP to make himself money and had hunter do the dirty work using his position as the leverage to get it done.</div>

    <div class="md">Wait.. this is fucking HILARIOUS. You still haven't heard updates to this story?!!? Read this. All of it. Specifically the part where they verified the laptop was real. Bahaha.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine being such an asshole/nasty person you get HARD over the idea of megacorporations and their dog walker moderators (unemployed) doing the dirty work of censoring real stories to protect their political candidates win elections. 

Just say you hate free speech, free dialogue, and democracy big guy.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah tax fraud and having a gun that wasn't purched legally. Those are some of the most American things you can do, are you telling me you're not a patriot?

I wasn't denying the existence of the laptop I'm saying sharing the story wouldn't have affected the election. You're delusional.

Oh and I hate corps and the government I just hate racists, bigots and wanna be nazis like you even more. So I like very much when they don't allow you to say dumb shit without any critical thinking processes happening in your head.

No one's a free speech absolutist. If you claim you are then you're just lying to yourself because I certainly don't believe you. Elon is quite literally the picture boy for denying free speech, free dialogue and democracy. He's trying to run Twitter like a dictatorship and the hate speech idiots are still getting banned. It's been a good week for the left. Strikes happening across the world against corps, protests all over agaisnt right wing governemnts, far left leaders are winning elections globally. I hope you're shaking in your little snowflake boots. 

We're coming for you and we will CRT your children into being decent human beings.</div>

    <div class="md">You are moving the goalposts big time, pal. You are incredibly boring, kinda like talking to a NPC running on a script. 

I suggest meeting some conservatives and instead of repeating stuff you heard on Hasan's streams, you just have a conversation and don't cry or get emotional, just listen and have a conversation.

Have a wonderful day "polite" guy is not polite at all LOL</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not moving goal posts, you quite literally said that twitter not allowing the Hunter Biden story affected the election and that is exactly what I engaged in from my first comment. Last time I had "normal conversation" about politics with a conservative he put a hole through his own coffee table. The time before that the guy wanted to step outside and fight me despite him being more than 30 years my elder. There's a pattern here if you aren't following. The pattern is that conservatives are fragile and when you point out obvious holes in their rhetoric their brains can't process the idea of being wrong so they have an emotional outburst. 

I live in a predominantly conservative county and I work in a garage. I talk to a lot of conservatives. I'm just as not as stupid as you are. Like no matter what happens in our conversation you're still getting censored you dumb fuck. It's kind of great. 

Also the name is a reference to a book; in which the Chandrian are the bad guys. I'm assuming you haven't opened too many of those. Books I mean.</div>
