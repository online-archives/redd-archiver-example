https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/s3zuwm/transgender_individuals_twice_as_likely_to_die/

I posted:

&gt;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10084515/Daphne-Dorman-trans-woman-bullied-death-defending-Dave-Chappelle.html

&gt;https://www.inquirer.com/news/daphne-dorman-suicide-dave-chappelle-netflix-sticks-and-stones-20191014.html

But my comment didn't show up, was removed immediately by automod.

I replied again to the thread with:

&gt;No doubt, just see what happened with Daphne Dorman.

I replied to another user with:

&gt;Neither does cancel culture. See Daphne Dorman.

Now I forget what they said, but I checked later and their comment was removed but both of mine were still up.

Someone replied to this comment of mine above saying that I don't know that this is why she killed herself and to stop pushing that agenda. Their comment appears to now be removed, along with both of my above comments.

Very curious what I did that warranted a ban, let alone a permanent ban. I mean I know it's r/science, one of the larger subs known for their censorship, but come on.

I replied to the ban message asking what I did that justified giving me a ban. No response yet.

Edit: Mod/s responded with:

&gt;You were banned for suggesting that "cancel culture" within the trans community is a significant factor in the death rate of trans people. The cause of Daphne Dorman's suicide is unknown.

I wrote back:

&gt;Because there is evidence to suggest she killed herself due to being bullied over defending Chapelle from 'cancel culture.' Me suggesting it may have played a part in her suicide is not unreasonable, and I don't see where my comment/s violate any rules in your siebar that warrant being banned, much less permanent ban.

They replied with:

&gt;Your comments violated our [comment rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_comment_rules) Have a nice day.

They wouldn't say what rule.

I said:

&gt;Which rule exactly?

They said:

&gt;Sorry, you seem to be mistaken in thinking this is up for debate. It is not. Have a nice day.</div>

    <div class="md">This.  The OP made a comment that didn't toe the leftist/sjw line hard enough.  Thus, *banned*.

They can’t have people going around just *brazenly* challenging the narrative. Then other people might start thinking it’s ok to do the same. 

Sorry.  That's how it works.</div>

    <div class="md">Come on, there are plenty of lefists who are not socialists and the vast majority of larger political subs are not even left, they are liberal in terms of propaganda. To elaborate, I'd say liberal (some neolibs, some neocons) and their dupes on the left aka mainstream left/vbnmw/shitlibs/bluemaga. Those particular leftists, enable the left being tamed by corporate centrists and are part of the rise of the authoritarian 'left' They parrot establishment dem propaganda and disinformation, censor and smear fellow leftist (even those to the left of them) as grifters, red-brown alliance, horseshoe theory, pushers of crazy right-wing conspiracy theories, talking points that help the right/enable Trumpers, so they say. That is basically their default is to call you a grifter and then try to connect you to the right and label any valid criticism and inconvenient truths as crazy right-wing propaganda to discredit you and it. The whole time, they run interference for leaders who don't leverage their power for progressive policy, leaders and a party that reject progressive policy and who helped make Trump a thing in the first place while working to stop progressives. But we're the dum dum and dirtbag left, right? They are nothing but projection machines and tools for the oligarchy.</div>
