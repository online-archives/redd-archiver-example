    <div class="md">Did op not give you one already? Just search for them. If you're saying they are accurate in that they will quote a fraction of a sentence out of context, especially when the prior or following sentence completely vindicates the quote, then we probably won't find anything to discuss here. For example, if you think trump sexually assaults women by grabbing by the pussy, wants to ban all Muslims, thinks all Mexicans are rapists and murderers, etc, then you have suffered the misquoting done by the fake news media. All you have to do is watch the uncut speeches. You won't LIKE the guy. I have always found him gross. I wouldn't shake his hand. But I'll still routinely correct people who claim he says things he has not said. And I sincerely don't want 4 more years of him, but he's going to get a lot of sympathy votes again. That's for sure.</div>

I really just want to see some verifiable and straightforward examples of how exactly he is being misquoted so I can accurately judge.</div>

To be perfectly honest, if you ask that using those words it sounds like you are taking the piss.

Most of the time it is fine to dissident with popular opinion, but you need to be smart about it. You need to be fucking humble and concise in your speech.</div>
