    <div class="md">It's an ancient, tried, and tested tactic: Play the victim while being the culprit. 

Non-Muslims do not understand the end-goal of Islam. Rather than look into the religion, its history, its stated objectives, and its ambiguous version of "morality", they just buy into the "oppressed minority" line that fits into their self-guilt agenda. 

Don't take it from me, however. Head on over to r/exmuslim and see what it's about first hand from those that have escaped it and are willing to expose its inner workings.</div>

    <div class="md">For some fucked up reason, minor grooming gang has been active in England for years, but police didn't do anything at all because they legit thought they'd be labelled as "Islamophobic" since the perpetrators have all been muslims.

I mean, sure you could say "don't generalize a religion" and all, but if a specific religion has caused incidents of violence and terrorism throughout the world since it's existence, then maybe systematic changes are needed to be made.</div>

We are taught about how Hitler killed Jews, but never about the violent acts and killings committed by invaders over Hindus because...secularism.</div>

These are in no way "grooming gangs", they are jihadist RAPE gangs, pure and simple. 

Also the nonsense with calling the criminals "Asian" to try and confuse things.

And if you talk about the truth too much, the corrupt government there will try to murder you, by throwing you in prison with the very rapists we're talking about.</div>

EXACTLY! This is the right point here. Thanks for pointing this out because even I used that terminology (media influence is subconsciously working here) instead of calling them who they are: Jihadis. This has nothing to do with Asian, White, Black etc. No matter what anyone says, but that is the truth.

My country itself has gone through it's fair share of long and brutal Islamic invasions and riots. And one thing I've noticed is how history keeps repeating itself. I just don't get why the world still tries to ignore it all and label "Islamophobic" to anyone who tries to speak raw truth.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh fuck off. It doesn't take a statistician to understand when you import a different culture into another, there's going to be a clash somewhere along the lines. I'm sure Sweden's rape stats have a different explanation as well? It could never be cultural differences with you people, there has to be SOME other explanation where somehow whitey is blamed and the burden of accountability is taken off the perpetrators of crime.

But please tell me more about the increasing sales of ice cream correlates with increasing crime rate to make sure you get in your little correlation does not equal causation example.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't need to read the stats on when you import the 3rd world you get the room temp IQ that comes with it. Can you give me your thesis on why rape and sexual crimes have skyrocketed when more immigrants were let in? 

&gt; statistics of the ethnicity of all convicted rapists between 2012 - 2017.

&gt;58% of all convicted rapists were born outside of Europe.

&gt;74.5% of all convicted gang rapists were born outside of Europe.

&gt;85% of all convicted assault rapists were born outside of Europe.

Elaborate please.

&gt;  bet you think black Americans perpetrate more crime because they make up a higher percentage of the US prison population too?

I think they commit more crime because they actually commit more crime compared to whites when accounting for population. I'm the sheep? Yet you're the one who has been conditioned and programmed by woke social media and most likely a liberal college. You know how I know you never been in the shittiest parts of the inner city?</div>

    <div class="md">Why edit the comment instead of replying? When you reply through an edit there's no notification, afraid of a response? I think the most pathetic part of your argument is that you honestly believe conviction rates correlate directly to whose committing crimes instead of who is being policed for said crimes. You must see the world out of your window and never actually experience it.

    <div class="md">No, you said you think because you don't actually know any better. 

Ah yes... conviction rates of Sweden, well known to not be racist at all... Do you understand the way the justice system works at all? For someone who uses so many crime statistics you ought to get familiar. Over policing of particular cultures combined with training to target minorities plus their neighborhoods and coerced confessions? I'd say there's no way to tell whose really committing what crimes and where under the current system when it's designed to target certain people. And as for the unreported/unprosecuted crimes. Yeah, that's exactly my point.

I'm not sure you want me to answer the only question you asked which was, "I'm the sheep?" To which my answer is, Yes. 

I may be as easy as Sunday morning but I'm not so easy that I would concede to a reactionary. I may call you a follower but a moron? C'mon man, you're better than insults, you can come up with some semblance of words to explain your shitty takes, can't you?</div>

    <div class="md">Haha oh man. Yea I know how it works, I was a criminal justice major. It's funny that you think someone convicted of a crime is somehow racist and they're innocent and just a target of over policing, when in reality, some jurisdictions don't even prosecute low level crime, whereas in other areas it would be prosecuted. Just look at Baltimore City's SA Mosby, she's choosing not to tackle low level crime, and it's getting worse.

I've been in the absolute worst parts of Baltimore City, I've had police officers tell me they don't even bother arresting hard drug offenses because the states attorney won't bother prosecuting it since there is much more violent crime. I literally watched a cop let a person go for possession of heroin, yet a white boy in the county would be sent through the judicial ringer for it.</div>

    <div class="md">There was nothing to deflect. Anecdotal stories that are at opposition with known statistics that are consistent across the country; doesn't really have anything too meaningful behind it. Even if your story is accurate (witness statements are notoriously innacurrate and you don't need a semester in a criminalogy course to know that) or even remotely true it's a shitty representation of the situation in our country. 

I could give you my own stories about actually going through the system. Tell you how many times I've been arrested vs how many times I was actually charged with something. Take that into account with my conviction rate and it starts to look a lot like harassment.

However my experience is my experience and I don't pretend it represents the majority. I stick with facts and so far all the stats you've provided are seriously biased. I've just been calling them out as such.</div>

    <div class="md">No because you can use actual math to prove the earth is round. Statistics is different because although you're using math you have to be careful about your sampling. There's many different methods which I don't feel like going through. The point remains, if your sampling method is biased so will your results be. 

Unfortunately there's not a good way to measure crime rates right now. The only way to measure crime is by what is reported. And certain places have a system in place (like NYPD) called COMPStat that literally encourages police cheifs to lie about crime rates in their precinct under threat of their job. If you need to bump your numbers up then you make more stops in certain areas. Probably predominantly minority neighborhoods(ie:black and or muslim). Back in '17 NYC had to pay out a 75 million dollar lawsuit against NYPD for over 900,000 unlawful criminal summonses. Not even arrests, just summonses. 

Career criminal? I've never been charged with a crime so I'm pretty confused by this. Have the police harassed me and arrested me under false pretenses based purely on where I live and having(admittedly) shitty friends? Definitely. Career criminal? Definitely  not. As a matter of fact I work as a teacher's assistant for special needs kids while I finish my degree. 

Which has granted me the patience to educate commenters like yourself.

Edit: I've never been convicted with a crime*</div>

    <div class="md">There's no reason to acknowledge straight up lies that's he's issuing. Nearly all low level crimes have come down in consistency since Mosby started this process a year ago. He's literally making shit up and you're eating it by the plateful. Do you also agree with the incoherent statistics in the post? The unlabeled chart and the articles are thrown together to make it seem as though they have a relation to each other when they don't.

The worst part is a lot of cities tried this and while Baltimore did really well in terms of bringing not just low-level, but also violent crimes down. Dozens of other cities tried the same and homicides and shootings rose in many of them. If mrstickup actually had infinitely more knowledge than me maybe he would've used a better example.</div>
