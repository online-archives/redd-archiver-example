    <div class="md">Here's the offending comment:

Answer: Joe invites all kinds of guests to his podcast to talk to them. Not to intimidate them but to have a conversation with them. A lot of people don't like the idea of right wingers being able to talk.
A lot of people also have a problem with liberals being able to talk. He didn't give Alex Jones much pushback, but he did the same with Jack Dorsey (Twitter CEO). People forget he's mostly just there to have a conversation and that this isn't some Fox News/ CNN segment.
So a lot of people choose to ignore everything else and just notice the fact that he's "giving right wingers a platform" when in reality he gives everyone a platform.</div>

    <div class="md">This is such a touchy topic. I'm a bit of both on this issue. I don't like the thought of abortion because from what I've read, it is a process that does end the life of a child in the womb. That being said, if you are willing to accept that not only are you ending a life but also hurting your chances of having a healthy baby in the future, do what you want to do. Free country. 

I may think that it's wrong, but I'm, not going to tell someone to no do something just because I disagree with it.</div>
