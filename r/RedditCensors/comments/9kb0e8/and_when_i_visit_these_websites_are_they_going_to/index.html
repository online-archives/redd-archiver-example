    <div class="md">I've been using reddit on a nearly daily basis for the better part of a decade (despite the age of this account) and I remember him. He, and this promise, are why I started in the first place. I can understand removing really extreme subs like /r/niggers or ones that post content that can get reddit into legal trouble. I never expected this site to have absolute free speech.

But it's so obvious that far-left ideology has seeped into high places that it's starting to become accepted as the obvious moral high ground and anybody else is a cryptofascist who needs to be shut down immediately. 

So basically, I miss Aaron and I miss the old reddit. The only reason I am still here is because there aren't any good competitors with the userbase. I'll just wait for the mass exodus of reddit to occur just like I did with Digg, and before that Myspace.
