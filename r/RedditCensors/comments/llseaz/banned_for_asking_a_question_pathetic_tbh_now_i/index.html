    <div class="md">Yup.

It's terrifying when you realize they also want to disarm innocent people.  There is no reason to disarm law abiding people unless you are worried they might stand up for themselves with it.

Why would they care if a law abiding person owns a gun and follows the laws?  

The next step is always removal of any "unallowables" which isn't a far step from "deplorables".

Also read *rules for radicals.*.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, it's like the public forgot what happens when left tilts to far. It's not in the memory of people. Look at Mao, Fidel, Stalin. These people instantly started murdering people who didn't play along. 


They couldn't do this today, unless they disarm us first. This could end really really bad. 

I sometimes think how everything happend in Nazi Germany at the time. How were the public okay with what was happening? They made their people hate jews(just like MSM is doing regarding Trump supporters) and AOC wanting to put his supprters on lists. I feel like those few people in WW2 that saw the evil going on and the propaganda and couldn't say or do anything out of fear(of being called a neo nazi trump supporter, or qAnon conspiracy nutcase) 
Honestly i think a lot of people are somewhat affraid to say what they believe and want.

And + with COVID19 and the tensions going on in the world, the "gestapo" censorship that's going on. 

This is not looking good. And people seem to not see what is right infront of them.</div>

    <div class="md">You'd be surprised.

There's a reason 43 million background checks for guns were performed in 2020.

People are waking up to the lies they have been fed by the oligarchy that have been in power since the Vietnam war.

But not enough and the media is owned and controlled, so things like cheating and impeachment of a non sitting president are considered okay.

Fucking clown world.</div>

    <div class="md">Lolol wow, what a shallow view!

No background checks aren't disarming people, making common use firearms illegal is.

I pass my background checks, I have multiple firearms, the left is actively trying to make my AR, that I use for competition CMP shooting, illegal nationally.

Go read the campaign site for Joe Biden, it's in his damn 100 day plan...

How about you stop trying to make a straw man out of background checks and deal with the actual fact that the current President has actually said he will ban a firearm that exists in the millions in the country.

That is disarming the people.

So got any other ignorant talking points youre going to parrot?</div>

Good.   I'm happy for you.

But I really don't give a fuck about your hobby of using your AR in shooting competitions when the price to pay for that freedom is criminals and mentally ill people easily able to get their hands on an AR.

And nobody wants to ban and take away your AR.   They want to restrict future sales and beef up the background check to remove the loopholes.

So get your facts straight before you parrot misinformation.</div>

    <div class="md">Do you honestly believe that people 18 yrs old should be able to walk in a store with $600 and buy an AR?  You can't even buy a beer under 21.   Why is that?

Not only is the brain not fully formed but there's been no time to accumulate a record of criminal behavior or mental disabilities.   Because a person's record as a juvenile gets wiped out and they start with a clean slate at 18.

Pretty much all of the deadly school shootings are done with ARs and boys under 21 yrs old.

I am actually very pro gun rights when it's done with common sense.  Both left &amp; right people blow the issue out of proportion purely for political reasons that politicians push on us all for money and votes.

I bet you and I would align very much in the center with our opinions on gun control in the USA.

The left thinks that conservatives want everyone armed to the teeth with no restrictions and unlimited firepower and the right to shoot someone for taking a piss on your lawn.

The right thinks the left wants to confiscate everyone's guns.  PERIOD!

If we block out the politics, the reality of what we all want on this issue is somewhere in the center.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Pretty much all of the deadly school shootings are done with ARs and boys under 21 yrs old.

I don't know where you got that claim from, but it's [laughably false](https://www.thetrace.org/newsletter/mass-shooting-gun-type-data/). 

You also seem to believe that buying a gun involves nothing more than going into a gun store with money in hand and walking out with a rifle. A number of 'journalists' have [set out](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/columnist-fails-gun-check-blames-store-owners) to demonstrate [that principle](https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-gun-buying-review-virginia-store-2019-8#overall-the-experience-left-me-with-the-impression-that-buying-a-gun-at-walmart-is-more-complicated-than-i-expected-and-that-walmart-takes-gun-sales-and-security-pretty-seriously-13), and have been proven wrong. Those stories are surprisingly hard to find though, because they don't want people like you to know better.</div>

    <div class="md">Welcome to free thinking. Now go read and watch all the “conspiracy theorists” and all the “right wing Nazi” journalists with an open mind. Even if you don’t believe everything, just listen. You will learn to filter out the nonsense from both sides and reach your own conclusions. Everything they dismiss as “bad faith” and “debunked”. 

The goal to them is always money and power and the media, politicians and lawmakers are joined at the hip. The politicians take our money to pay the media to report their facts so they can reference on FISA warrants and during impeachment proceedings.  

They take our tax money and launder it through foundations and companies where their family members and friends get contracts and sit on boards all the while enriching themselves with our hard earned money. 

This is Democrat’s and Republicans alike. Greedy and manipulative and NOT representing the people who supposedly elected them.</div>

    <div class="md">Thi is what has happened to me for the last 5 months or so, just waking up to the brainwashing. Honestly i know it's cliché saying this but it's the fucking truth i was like 95% of reddit a couple of months ago saying all the "right" things and basically an echo chamber for this propaganda and really believing all the trash CNN says and MSM in general, and if i bring this up to people who used to be like me , they turn on you SO FAST! Everyone! The same comments from everyone. People have literally been programed through the tell-a-vision. I feel like people are waking up to this, but are not willing to say so in public out of fear of being outcasted.</div>

But they don't mention the virus much, or the protests and riots still happening in big cities, or the millions of people out of work. They only mentioned those before because Trump =bad.

    <div class="md">Yes so true. If the MSM is going to be critical they need to be equally critical to both sides but they obviously don't and people(me included) are just blind to it.. it took me a little time to get out of this propaganda bubble, we just need the rest of the people to notice and they will it is just not going to take the same time for everyone to wake up.. i feel like 2018-2020 has opened the eyes of many people, and with this virus even more. 

We need to help speed things up somehow and try to let people see this for themselves. You can't push this on people they need to do some "research" and see how the media and big tech censor EVERYTHING critical about the radical-left. And this will hopefully make them question their political beliefs and just see how the world is really just fake. This happened for me,, i vot this scare in me like "wow im rooting the bad team here".</div>

    <div class="md">I don't think you should have been banned but it was a stupid fucking question that is based on bullshit that's trending on the most radical right-wing outlets right now.

Honestly, do you really think that because the guy took a few minutes on his off time to play a video game with his grandchild that he's just playing video games all day in the middle of a pandemic?  Do you really believe something that ridiculous?

If he spends 5 minutes taking a shit this morning do you also think he's just sitting on the toilet shitting all day in the middle of a pandemic?

Your question was moronic.    But no, they should not have banned you.   Not for that.  You should have been given the opportunity to have some people describe to you what an idiotic question that was.

But if they looked at your karma score they probably thought they were just dealing with an asshole troll looking for trouble.</div>

    <div class="md">I can speak from experience that r/conservative is run by real pieces of shit. I had a post pulled from there because I said Matt Walsh is a boomer on video games, and the mod said that he wouldn't reapprove if I rephrased because I'd insulted his hero, so I said how very leftist of you. Cue permanent ban and monthlong mute.</div>

    <div class="md">Wrong team?  Depends if you enjoy freedoms and thinking for yourself.  It appears you do, so welcome to the right team.  Obviously there are people who voted against Donald and just went D down the whole ticket because of it - so think of midterms.  If you want one party rule and radical change after midterms, vote Dem again and be stripped of freedoms and enjoy working to pay for people who don’t want to.

    <div class="md">Nothing can be questioned on the left. When things can't be questioned, false beliefs are prevalent. 

Questioning, dialectics, even arguments are beneficial in the sense that the strongest ideas prevail. The ideas closest to reality.

Free speech is vital.</div>

    <div class="md">I'll give you an example.

Imagine believing that only bad people are being censored or that it isn't happening.

That those jokes about hive mind and "useful idiots" are just anger from the right.

Untill one day, it's you being banned for not toeing "the new party" lines/talking points or asking the wrong question.

Wouldn't that make you wonder if the people who were also banned aren't what you told they were?

If you thought that only bad people with wrong opinions get banned, yet you yourself got banned but know you're not a hateful person, not a bigot or any "ist", couldn't that of happen to all the other people also banned?

Remember, the left and right aren't that far separated until you hit the extremes, it's not hard to see how someone in the middle would change sides once they've experienced the exact thing the "right" side warned them about the left.</div>
