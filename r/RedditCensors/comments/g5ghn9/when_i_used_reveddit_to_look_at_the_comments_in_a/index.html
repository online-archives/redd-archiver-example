    <div class="md">The_donald is (or was) a subreddit for Trump supporters. The name and the rules reflect this. Likewise, I would not expect a subreddit dedicated to Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders to be politically neutral.

Nextfuckinglevel is ostensibly not political at all, yet in practice, its moderation is politically and personally biased. Atheism is ostensibly a subreddit for atheists, but acts like an “atheism+” or liberal atheism subreddit.

These examples are not comparable.</div>

    <div class="md">Nope, here is why;

The mods of the subreddit originally allowed anyone to comment, but it was instantly brigaided by every leftist / communist subreddit and Reddit admins did nothing to ban or stop those people.

You are allowed to have a community of likeminded people (echo chamber) **as long as you state the intentions and rules of the community**

I mean how can you even argue this in good faith? Reddit admins recently rempved this post: (https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/fub7xo/introducing_the_solidarity_award_a_100) from /r /announcements because all the top comments were pointing out the hypocrisy of Reddit. All big social media sites have been censoring and banning anyone that disagrees with progressive liberal ideology **and using this ability to SWAY PEOPLES OPINIONS when they unknowingly enter the space thinking it is a place of neutral discussion that accurately portrays society.**

Read /r/ watchredditdie and see the TONS AND TONS of evidence. Its all right there. Tons of evidence. Go watch some YouTube videos on this topic. Go watch Smartereveryday's videos on this topic.</div>

ROTFLMAO..  You use sed as proof of no bias?  The same asshat that claimed youtube, twitter and facebook are non bias?

You know the censors that pay him?

LOL

Propaganda princess and you treat him as the keeper of all things factual.  You're hilarious.

Let me ask you, you seem to be a TD supporter.  Fine.  That typically goes with a pro-america stance.  Also fine.  Do you feel the USA was just in fighting WWII?  In Dropping "the bomb" to end the war and save lives?</div>
