    <div class="md">1. Incels are very much a product of modern society. Just like everything else out there, they do not spontaneously erupt out of the vacuum. They arise from the stress cracks and corrosive narratives that have eroded modern society over the last 50 years. I might not agree with Incels in the least, and I certainly see them as a failures of self-reflection and abrogations of personal responsibility. But I also understand why they exist, and to a limited extent, sympathize with their struggles.
2. Large chunks of society have the mistaken impression that they can shame the incel out of people, in the same way you can shame a specific gender out of people. Subsequently wondering why shaming makes things dramatically worse is no less idiotic than wondering why fires get much worse when you throw jet fuel onto them.
3. Hypergamy has gone well beyond a mere _plausible_ theory, to a well-established theory that has been extensively examined by many sociologists and social scientists and fits the real-world evidence extremely well. Even armchair observers can make reasonably accurate predictions of potential female behaviour if they employ the hypergamy model in a faithful and honest manner.</div>

Are there any sources you have regarding hypergamy in human females?</div>
