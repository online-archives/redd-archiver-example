Also I'd encourage anyone reading this to unsub from /r/news. The best way to show Reddit that it shouldn't be a default sub is to keep its subscriber count lowering. 

Neither side should be ok with censorship. </div>

[comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6dtsbj/police_say_eight_people_are_dead_including_deputy/di5eklu/?context=10000)

Will look for archived version with comment undeleted.

Shooter was black, so it appears it's going against the agenda of r/news.

**Edit:** Latest archieve of page before mods deleted /u/GuacamoleFanatic 's comment. [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170528211738/https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6dtsbj/police_say_eight_people_are_dead_including_deputy/)

Black shooter also had extensive previous criminal record, here is /u/guacamolefanatic comment verbatim.

&gt;**Suspect handcuffed**

&gt;* Shootings occurred at three separate homes Saturday night in rural Lincoln County 

&gt;* Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said the suspect, Willie Cory Godbolt, aged 35, was captured Sunday morning 

&gt;* Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said charges have not yet been filed against the 
suspect

&gt;* Godbolt told the Clarion-Ledger that his intentions were to take his children and that other people intervened

&gt;* He said: It cost them their lives, Im sorry and that his intention was suicide by cop

&gt;* Authorities have not released the identities or ages of those killed  

&gt;BROOKHAVEN, Mississippi (AP) — Authorities in Mississippi say a suspect is in custody after eight people were killed in a shooting, including a sheriff’s deputy. Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said the shootings occurred at three separate homes Saturday night in rural Lincoln County. Strain says charges have not yet been filed against the suspect and that it would be “premature” to discuss a motive. It was not clear whether the suspect knew his victims before allegedly killing them.

&gt;Willie Godbolt, 35, has a long criminal record, including:

&gt;■ Charged with armed robbery and aggravated assault in 2005 after he allegedly struck a man with a pistol and took his cash and jewelry;

&gt;■ In 2013, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office charged him with simple assault;

&gt;■ Arrested in 2015 for disorderly conduct/breach of peace and failure to comply with a request from a sheriff;

&gt;■ Arrested in 2015 for speeding, driving with a suspended license, and no proof of liability insurance by the Mississippi Highway Patrol.

&gt;In 2016, Godbolt filed an appeal to a judgment against him in a simple assault and disorderly conduct case. [Source](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/05/28/mississippi-shooting-8-dead-including-deputy-suspect-says-aint-fit-to-live.html)
