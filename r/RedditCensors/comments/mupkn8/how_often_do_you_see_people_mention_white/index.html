I was banned from r/politics for 1 day for "incivility" when I said a comment was "disingenuous."

https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/msgspv/banned_for_calling_a_comment_disingenuous/

After I complained they perma banned me for "trans hate." I was saying that males shouldn't participate in female sports due to biological advantages.</div>

    <div class="md">Well, here’s a devil’s advocate: what if that kid really is that smart?

What if he truly deserves those opportunities, and he was really exceptional enough such that the colour of his skin had no material impact in the approval process?

Yes, affirmative action is a thing. It would be stupid to deny that. But all of these universities get plenty of black applicants, and affirmative action places _randomly-selected_ more-mediocre people ahead of better-talented people. The likelihood that this kid really is exceptional goes up dramatically with every offer -- it becomes exceedingly improbable that all 5 schools happened to provide offers to the same kid via affirmative action over ability, due to the randomized nature of affirmative action.

Frankly, with 5 offers, I don’t see any real likelihood of privilege here except for meritocratic privilege. 🤷🏼‍♂️</div>

    <div class="md">The comment has no context, it's literally just poking the bear to get banned. Same as posting just the word "naggers." It breaks rule #3 Low Hanging Fruit. So explain to me how a NJ student getting accepted into multiple colleges is black privilege rather than someone who worked hard and earned it? Better yet explain to me how black privilege even exists?</div>

    <div class="md">Because there are quotas, because black people are accepted in unis with drastically lower grades than everyone else, because they are being pulled all the way from school to a guaranteed job place despite doing drugs instead of actually studying. 

And with the amount of catering black people recieve there is a higher chance that this guy was accepted for his skin colour than for his actual abilities and knowledge, which is racist according to the *real* definition of racism: "positive or negative discrimination of a person based solely on race".</div>

    <div class="md">The quotas exist as an attempt at compensating for systemic disenfranchisement. Statistically white people come from a place of privilege. Better Healthcare, better education, better communal support. The majority of people who come from wealthy backgrounds are white identifying. Yes, there are outliers on both sides. The doesn't mean we just leave everyone else behind. And even with these quotas white identifying students are accepted with ~65% rate while only being ~50% of applicants.

The whole getting high and getting free ride jobs is something I've never even heard of before. If you don't have a source for that can you at least tell me where you heard that line? 

Also no that is not and never has been the definition of racism.

Noun: racism- 
-prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

-the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics, abilities, or qualities, especially so as to distinguish them as inferior or superior to one another.</div>

    <div class="md">What you call "white people privilege" is actually caring parents. This is not a "privilege", it's the norm in a civilized society. Caring parents force you to study, caring parents look after your health, caring parents work to help you build your future  (even with the quotas the black people unemployment is high, not because evil white people refuse to employ good and righteous black people, by the way). It is not our problem that rate of fathers running away from responsibility is exceptionally high in black communities and we should not compensate it at our own expense.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh really, you didn't ever hear about shitty grades black people receive on average? And that they are still accepted in unis over way better scoring white people? Were you living under a rock?

&amp;#x200B;

It was always the definition of racism, before sjws decided to try to change it. The one you provided is just an invitation for victim play to exploit guilt.</div>
