      <div class="md">BannedBase is a place for banned Reddit communities to regroup and work toward reestablishing a presence on Reddit. 

This subreddit is a solution to increasingly commonplace, heavy-handed, viewpoint discriminatory subreddit bans that are an affront to freedom of expression in a world in which political speech occurs almost exclusively on private servers. 

BannedBase is an insurance plan for controversial subreddits who face the banhammer. Here’s how it works: 

1.	Subreddit A is increasingly coming under scrutiny for its controversial views. Perhaps the admins have warned the mods. More mainstream subs are beginning to take notice and call for Subreddit A to be banned. 

2.	The mods of Subreddit A sticky a “ban protocol” to their sub so that everyone in the sub knows that the backup plan in case of a ban is to regroup at BannedBase. (Ideally, if this sub gets big enough, there won’t have to be sticky and everyone will just know that this is the place to regroup). 

3.	Reddit bans Subreddit A.

4.	An official thread will be created within BannedBase for “survivors,” subscribers of Subreddit A, to regroup and plan to create a Subreddit A replacement. 

5.	While Subreddit A subscribers plan a replacement subreddit, Reddit Admins are invited to BannedBase for a transparent, open dialogue with “survivors” for how the replacement subreddit can comply with Reddit’s sitewide rules. 

This subreddit is viewpoint neutral. This is a free speech zone. Only violations of Reddit’s site-wide rules and attempts to undermine the goals of this subreddit will be met with moderator interference. This subreddit does not care if you are right or left wing. This subreddit exists to protect dissenting and controversial opinions within the marketplace of ideas. 

If we are banned, let us be banned together. The more people who come together to support this subreddit, the more protected free expression will be on the Internet. 

Please help me make this subreddit work guys. </div>

My sweet summer child...

I don't dislike your idea and I upvoted and subbed, but you are assuming that subs are banned for breaking Reddit rules when the reality of the situation is that those rules are used as an excuse to ban right-leaning subs.</div>
