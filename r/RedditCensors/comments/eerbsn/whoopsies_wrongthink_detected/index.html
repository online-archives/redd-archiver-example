    <div class="md">The OP was complaining about AHS brigading.

AHS basically consists of a bunch of trannies dedicated to stamping out wrong think.

They would be easy to ignore and be left alone but they demand to be included "everywhere". When people complain about their brigading they are told to take their sub private. When people go into AHS and complain they are banned and reported for brigading.

As such my post fits. Any discussion of AHS should highlight the trans agenda being pushed there and how it negatively effects the rest of Reddit and Reddit's user base.</div>

Though in your defense the mods shouldn't remove it and let the vote system do what it's intended to do (which is silence those who contribute nothing to the topic at hand).</div>

    <div class="md">I think it needs to be heard there.

The trans agenda moderation staff are chasing off readers. Their attitudes and stances are fracturing the cohesion of LGBT groups who worked hard to become a unified force for positive change. And angering and disenfranchising allies to the cause with their over zealous moderation practices.

First we tell people nicely.</div>

    <div class="md">That's like walking up to a mechanic's shop and you just start talking about the dangers of leaving children unattended in cars.

No one who is there gives a fuck and the reason people are there have nothing to do with the shit you're talking about, even if the topics are related.

Again, I am not agreeing or disagreeing with your stance on the issue. So I don't want that to come up. But you are autistic as fuck and have no sense of where that discussion belongs (hint: it's not in modsupport).</div>
