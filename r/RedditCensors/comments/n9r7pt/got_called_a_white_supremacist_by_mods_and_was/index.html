    <div class="md">For the record and not that it should matter, I voted Biden in 2020 and I support BLM. But a black person using a term like “honky” is the opposite to the solution of our problems.

Edit: everyone’s freaking the fuck out about me saying that I support BLM. You can support the ideology behind BLM without supporting some aspects of their movement. Racial injustice is a real thing, you don’t need to be “woke” or whatever the fuck to realize that.</div>

    <div class="md">What’s that supposed to mean..?

Also regardless of political opinion there’s no reason to not support the idea behind what Black Lives Matter stands for, regardless of some of the inner workings of some groups that organize for it and do bad things in the name of it. All I’m trying to explain is that I’m clearly not a white supremacist but that term got thrown at me for literally no reason by someone who is supposed to curate a community.

Doesn’t excuse censorship whether you agree with me or not.</div>

    <div class="md">Lmao this is some weird and deplorable shit that you’re commenting. Do you not think racial injustice is a thing in America? I’m not one of those woke idiots that posts on Instagram about BLM all day. I support the ideology of bringing change to America, that’s it. I mentioned that I support it to further reason that I am not a racist. I don’t know why you’re trying to act like you’re “owning the libs” or something when I’m reality you’re talking to a guy that voted Trump in 2016 and besides Biden in 2020 I voted Republican down the rest of the ticket.</div>

By aligning yourself with a group that supports black criminality and celebrates confirmed thugs as their figureheads. You really think BLM is able to change anything in any meaningful way? What a joke. 

&gt;Do you not think racial injustice is a thing in America? 

Certainly not in the way BLM tries to make it out. Black over-representation in crime statistics is not the fault of the rest of society.</div>

    <div class="md">The BLM org. literally perpetuates deplorable racism &amp; injustice. They in no way, shape or form fight against it.

The BLM organization is racist. Supporting them is supporting a racist organization. This does not strengthen your assertion that you are not racist. I believe you, just also believe you are completely misinformed and totally naive about the BLM org.

You're right that /WPT is also incredibly racist and you getting banned there for such a valid and reasonable comment only supports that fact.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; the premise of BLM itself as a movement is not bad.

The premise of BLM is a lie. That black people find themselves disproportionately victims of unprovoked violence from police is a complete falsehood. If BLM wanted to truly make black people safer from police, they would be campaigning within the black community to reduce black crime and stop the idolization of thug culture. But no, it's easier to just blame whitey and pocket donations on an industrial scale. 

Imagine my shock when they give no fucks about your opinions on the word honkey. They use that word and worse ones on the regular. Your support of them means you have no right to cry about it.</div>

    <div class="md">The *ideology* that black lives matter is self evident. All people matter. It also has *nothing* to do with the BLM org.

The BLM organization stands for the exact opposite. They are blatantly racist bigots that founded and run that org.

For me it's the idea that black people are shot more often than white (by cops), therefore  it must be racism.  

Males get shot at a ratio of 9:1 vs females.  People would laugh if you said the department had a hatred of males.</div>

    <div class="md">The ideology "black lives matter" has absolutely nothing to do with the BLM organization. They do not help black people or their communities in the least. Not one penny of their millions in donations has gone to anyone but the leaders of the scam organization, and equally corrupt DNC politicians. 

The BLM organization is founded by rabid leftist Marxists. Their entire goal is destruction of America, family values, and they are notoriously racist against people of European &amp; Asian descent. 

The ideology is good, that is self evident. The organization is pure evil, run by selfish, dangerously deranged bigots, liars &amp; scammers.</div>

I support the idea behind BLM because racial injustice is a real thing in this country. I voted trump in 2016 and decided to vote for Biden in 2020 because I lost family members to COVID because of bullshit spewed by Trump. I am far from left/liberal.

Judging me by my vote and my single belief on a social issue (which I was using as examples to show that I’m not a racist) is exactly what the mods of that sub did to me when I made a comment asking why the use of the word “honkies” was allowed. You’re doing the same thing.

    <div class="md">Your heart's in the right place, but you have to realize that the BLM organization is founded and run by just the kind of racist bigots you're calling out.

Biden has a long history of blatant racism. So many hard R's, even in official government meetings. 

The /WPT sub is one of the most blatantly racist cesspools on reddit as well. At least you got that one right.</div>

Never said I supported any sort of organization, BLM itself is a movement which I think overall has an agreeable ideology. Most groups that organize in the name of BLM however I disagree with because most times they exist as a product of “woke culture”

&gt;Biden has a long history of blatant racism. So many hard R's, even in official government meetings.

I mean.. so does trump. I voted trump in 2016 and might have again if he didn’t blatantly use dog whistles and spew BS about COVID (which directly led to several personal losses for me). I chose the lesser of two evils.</div>

Again, you are completely and utterly misinformed here. 

That is the entire problem. You really need to do some research into the organization itself. 

Also, Trump has zero history of any kind of racism at all. In fact, exactly the *opposite*. Another blatant lie you've swallowed whole with zero personal research.

Sucks you got censored from a massively racist sub. There we can agree.

Everything else you're saying though is just mindless regurgitation of rabid leftist propaganda. 

Have a nice day.</div>

    <div class="md">Why do you keep saying organization?? BLM is not just a group, like are you aware of that? You know that it is also just a generally-used term at this point?

It’s like saying that someone that supports MAGA is complicit in the January 6th event, it’s not true.

Also, you’ve offered no more proof that Biden is racist than I did for Trump, and I’m sure I could find way more corroborating stories of trump being racist than joe Biden being racist. This is coming from someone who reluctantly voted for trump in 2016 *because* of concerns about his racist past. It’s not bullshit that’s being fed to me by the media, I’d argue that it’s quite the opposite here my friend.

Stop watching OANN/Fox.</div>

    <div class="md">I see two things going on here. One, it's definitely possible to use slurs and be racist against white people. r/BlackPeopleTwitter sees it as less of a concern than overarching racial justice. It's kinda cringe, and clearly it causes a lot of people (like you) to react poorly.

But on the other hand, there's a ton of people (right here in the comments section) who think institutional racism is justified, ostensibly because they got called honky in the past. 

There are black racists and black ethnostaters. Thankfully they're remarkably powerless. I can't say the same about white racists.</div>
