      <div class="md">About two months ago, I was banned from /r/racism. Here's is the ban:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzi.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzi.png)

Reddit has said before that a mod should not issue a ban from a subreddit for activity outside of that subreddit. Knowing this, I messaged the moderators:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzj.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzj.png)

And again the next day, when there was no reply...

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzk.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzk.png)

And again the next day, when there was no reply...

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzl.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzl.png)

At this point I was muted...

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzn.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzn.png)

So I waited my three days and messaged again...

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzm.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzm.png)

Finally I received the following reply...

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzo.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzo.png)

If you're keeping track, that's the second time that the moderators of /r/racism have confirmed that they are issuing a ban simply because I have posted in another subreddit, nothing more. Here is the text of my reply, and am image as well... 

*Good afternoon,*

*Thank you for the reply.*

*I understand that you have found users from that subreddit participating in brigading your subreddit. Their actions don't concern me, and I certainly don't condone their actions. Brigading is wrong and is not in the spirit of what Reddit stands for. Basically, it breaks Reddit.*

*I follow and participate in many subreddits because the content of those subreddits interests me. Some subreddits I frequent but do not follow. Participating in a subreddit does not mean I am guilty of the actions of some subscribers of that subreddit.*

*I will continue to post on CA and I will continue to follow all Reddiquette as outlined by the admins.*

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzq.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzq.png)

Here is the text of the reply I received...

 *Cool. You do you, and we'll do our thing.* 

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzr.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzr.png)

Apparently, despite Reddit specifically saying that moderators should not do that, they think it's perfectly fine to do it anyway. At this point I don't have many options. Reddit does not exactly equip users with the necessary tools to alert the admins when a moderator is in violation of Reddit's modiquette. All I can do is message them and remind them that they are in violation of Reddit's policies and because of that the ban should be lifted. I used the Moderator Complaint form, which is stickied at the top of this subreddit. I filed multiple complaints. I have received absolutely nothing back. Initially I messaged with this:

*Good evening,*

*A week and a half ago I was banned despite never having posted on* [*/r/racism*](https://www.reddit.com/r/racism)*. I messaged about this but received no reply. I messaged again 24 hours later, but received no reply. I messaged again after another 24 hours and was muted for 72 hours. I waited the 72 hours then messaged again asking to be unbanned as I had never even posted on your sub before meaning, according to Reddiquette and Modiquette, I can not have broken a subreddit rule. I was asked about my posting on other subreddits and I confirmed my behavior would certainly not change outside of your subreddit. Reddit has historically spoken out against mods issuing bans for behavior outside of their subreddits. Please unban me. Thank you.*

Here is a screenshot of the message I sent, with the moderator's reply "tl;dr" below:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzt.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzt.png)

Here is the reply I received, and the messages that ultimately ended in another 72 hour mute:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzu.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzu.png)

Notice the moderator says "don't give a fuck not gonna read" and "piss off"

Here is another thread after my next 72 hour wait:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzv.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzv.png)

Here the moderator simply states "You will not be unbanned. Stop harassing us." So apparently it's harassment to use the only means Reddit has given me to get the rules to be followed. As a moderator, you are bound my Reddit's rules. 

At this point I messaged every three days with generally the same message. It was something like:

*Good afternoon,*

*It has now been TIME since I was banned from your subreddit despite having never posted in your sub before. Reddit admins have repeatedly stated that actions outside of a subreddit can not be used as reason to ban a user.*

*Please unban me. Thank you.*

This was pretty much always met with a 72 hour mute, but sometimes I got stuff like:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzw.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzw.png)

Finally, last Wednesday, I receive this:

[http://magaimg.net/img/6pzy.png](http://magaimg.net/img/6pzy.png)

I've sent in three appeals using [reddit.com/appeal](https://reddit.com/appeal). You can only submit one per day. The form they give you only allows 250 characters. I've explained, to the best anyone can in 250 characters, this entire situation. I have heard absolutely nothing. 

I submitted appeals. I used the moderator reporting functionality, I used modmail. 

I do not have any other tools at my disposal to get a moderator to abide by the same rules I am bound by. Reddit's only reply has been to support the moderator's behavior, despite that behavior being directly against Reddit's modiquette, and issue my a three day site-wide suspension.

I just don't get what else we're supposed to do when moderators are like this? I refuse to simply let it happen. There are rules on this site. They're meant to be followed.</div>

    <div class="md">Your first mistake is thinking the mods of /r/racism care about you, and the second was thinking that the admins of reddit will care about you or those mods. People need to realize that this website, despite how it presents itself, isn't some digital beacon of morality. It was designed from the ground up to cater to advertisement money.

The admins are all few in number and overworked. They simply don't have the time or care to help. Moderator accounts will always have preferential treatment over normal users. They don't review the evidence or take context into their judgements, they probably have a set of guidelines they follow which allows them to quickly pass judgement. </div>

    <div class="md">Because Reddit is corrupt and the admins are complicit. Rules for thee, but not for me... Piggybacking with a recent write up of my own about the same abuse, as well as facilitation of a brigading tool by the admins, mods, and half of Reddit:

Masstagger is a direct violation of the Reddit CoC and it's acceptance by admins of the widespread use of it to use ad hominem attacks against conservatives instead of actual arguments is hypocritical.

https://i.imgur.com/ALRrImD.png

r/ masstagger is facilitating brigading and vote manipulation and outright calls for it by pointing out in their announcements a specific set of reddit users that represent a very large portion of the users from the US.

Evidence can be found here:

https://www.screencast.com/t/czzeB3clPRq

https://www.screencast.com/t/3TwXSNAgp6

https://www.screencast.com/t/9e82Jxr14 

http://archive.is/jFulP (funny he calls out r/the_donald and even suggests a nice color to give them. I wonder if the point of this is so that they can give nice well thought out discourse to those users or just blindly downvote anyone who shows up with a color?)

Bonus round: https://www.screencast.com/t/jEi0RmsbdycY It is well known that mods are blanket banning users from multiple subs they moderate just for posting in other subs they don't like. Why are admins not taking steps to prevent this?

Very rules for thee but not for me to constantly implement technological and sociological methodology to quarantine and censor wrongthink (according to some), while encouraging the same behavior through complicity with righthinkers (again, only according to some).

http://archive.is/qG2lH

https://www.screencast.com/t/PFS3jqDyE

What a riot!

If Reddit admins didn't have double standards, they wouldn't have any at all.

Leftists attack anyone who is pro-trump on reddit, even in other subs where the conversation is not political, by pointing out they post in T_D and are therefore racist ignorant rednecks.

Trump supporters only post on T_D and a few other subs since the rest of reddit is openly hostile to every one of their comments. Reddit then points to how they post so much only in T_D as some sort of proof that they are brainwashed.

Meanwhile the accusers and idiots are all posters regularly in r/ politics r/ politicalhumor, etc. They attempt to point at the single sub as evidence that the polarization is only right wing despite them spreading liberal propoganda and censorship across the rest of the site.

Redditors try to further inflame passions by saying T_D is a hate sub and use random comments with barely any upvotes as proof. Meanwhile links to violent and vulgar posts are shown with thousands of upvotes on the leftist subs, and either the thread is locked, the comments showing these are removed, or simply nobody else engages the comment thread.</div>

    <div class="md">I've been thinking about this post since I read it, and the final thought that came to mind is this: If they're a subreddit against racism and what's usually entailed with it, then how do they expect to reach anyone that's even slightly racist if they're banning on a whim of a post or browse of an entirely different subreddit? How do they expect the legitimate reason as to why that subreddit was made to actually be served? And if that isn't what it's for but rather to bring light to racist events, wouldn't r/news or a help group work better for the users that go there?</div>

    <div class="md">Yep.  This is why I just make new accounts when I’m banned because some mod doesn’t like that I’m in another sub.  Once a few acts ago I was hit with the auto tagger because YEARS prior I had tried to “debate” with some folks in T_D when it was new.  

That acct was tagged as a T_D member. Even though it had been years. So I was auto banned from a few places.  One of which I really liked.  The mods didn’t care in much the same way.  

So new acct it was.  If they’re gonna break the rules I can too.  </div>
