    <div class="md">yes, they're perfectly in their rights, currently at least. Doesn't mean it's ethical. free speech is more than just a law, it's a concept. When a corporation is large enough that them censoring someone has far ranging implications, it's morally wrong. I think it's time certain, not all, but certain corporations (depending on the size and other factors one would have to first carefully weight) are required to hold up free speech as much as the government is.  
Trump not being allowed to block people on twitter actually set a precedence for exactly something like this.</div>

    <div class="md">The difference is the POTUS, a government official, cannot suppress your speech. If I block you on twitter, or if twitter simply decides to edit what I say (absent governmental pressure of course) that is their choice. If a government official does it, it violates the first amendment protection against that very thing.</div>

    <div class="md">but him blocking anyone does not suppress anyone's free speech. they still can say what they want, he'll just not see it on this platform. And if that is bad, why doesn't the POTUS' phone number have to be public? or why can he use window shades? Why can he have somebody removed from his hotel room?  
When you realized why twitter is different from those places, you should realize why free speech should apply to twitter as a whole. Should, not does, mind you, as said in my opening comment</div>

    <div class="md">It seems...stupid.
In some cases, censorship is necessary on social media. Lies and hate can influence people, actions and beliefs. As we see here too often however, censorship is something overused for just opposing beliefs which is a misuse of it. For the most part, censoring and silencing should be avoided.

Reddit is a special case though because 90% of the time, it isnt reddit censoring, it is the communities mods that are. That essentially makes Reddit immune to any action because nothing can be done about what communities decide to allow or ban. Reddit does ban some subreddits that they shouldnt but that wont get them into any trouble either in this case.

Seems to me more like a political stunt. Doubt anything will come of it but this appearing just a year from the 2020 election is no coincidence. Lots of people (including myself) hate extreme left censorship of pretty much anything they dont agree with. Saying something will be done about it on social media and free speech will be upheld will give a hard on for such people.

Other than Reddit, I also havent seen too much censorship because of this lack of community owned forumns. On twitter, some have been banned but understandably, such as Alex Jones who says a lot of dumb and stupid shit to rile up people. Like I said though, doubt anything will come of this. On top of the issue of trying to implement a system to stop falsely censoring people, there will be too much complaints that mean nothing like from reddit. Subreddits can freely censor indiscriminately unfortunately.</div>

    <div class="md">Just seems pretty ignorant to believe he can. Reddit is, like I said, user run communities. I know I will get downvoted to fuck cause people dont like censorship here buuut its reddit is just a large scale version of group messages on any social app. If I ban someone from a group, be it snapchat, messenger, discord or whatever, it would probably fall into the same group as what some reddit communities do.

Even if he could do anything about it. What could happen? User run moderation would have to end. Does reddit have to then mod ever sub including the small ones like this? Do they need a report system that wont work? What is the limit of what is censorship and what is just moderating?

Censorship is something necessary to some degree however, especially now in social networking. Stupid, ignorant people who cant be bothered to research anything are easily swayed. The entire anti-vax campaign is based on lies and conspiracies and kids are dying as a result. Censoring anti-vax shit is something I wouldnt hate. The mass shooters such as in NZ were also so mentally ill that it was the internet that made them kill all those people, they were vulnerable and blindly believed all the hate they saw online, it led to many people being killed.

Like I said, I dont expect to be upvoted here on a clearly anti-censorship sub, but censorship is a very dodgy topic. It is both not used enough and horribly overused out of personal opinion. People are banned for opposing views and some people are basically killing people from what they spread online. I dont love censorship, I despise it. If I believed everyone was smart enough not to believe in shit like anti-vax I would be fine with no censorship. But yeah, some people are very weak mentally and some people are easily confused children.

I also hope you already know this but the free speech amendment means shit here. The amendment only effects the government. A company is free to censor whatever they want. The amendment is just to stop governments from censoring criticism. But like I said, you probably already knew that.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah quite disappointed. Thought this sub was just about calling out ridiculous mod bans. Not a retarded right wing circle jerk. Im not right or left. Both sides are stupidly ignorant to their own failings and love to make up lies and censor, sterotype and label the other side. If people here are too stupid to understand that getting rid of public moderation isnt exactly a good thing then they can fuck off to sites that arent reddit.

Reddits literally unique because it has publicly run subreddits and discussions. You cannot stop censorship without getting rid of all that. 4chan exists, twitter and facebook exist and you are free to run your own subreddit like people are already doing in response to shitty moderation. Calling out dumbass mods is fun. Calling out dumb censors is fun. Being racist or stupid, getting banned and then being salty about it is childish. Believing Trump can come save the day by giving you the talking stick is also childish. Like I said, just a thing to get him support for the next election.</div>

    <div class="md">Absolutely agree. I joined because I've had some comment censoring in the past, but this sub is the most toxic circlejerk on the site outside of t_d.

It's a bunch of kids complaining about getting banned from subs because of racism, homophobia, etc.</div>
