Thank you for sharing that fantasy of yours, really, but you're setting up a straw man, and supporting it with a delusional conspiracy theory.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Preach to the choir, tell us all what it means to be silenced. To be  wiped off of every avenue for public discourse. Gawd isn't it *terrible* that this is allowed to happen to *you*?? Of all people! 

&amp;#x200B;

Fascinating logic. Would you care to tell me where or when I said that white people or "Aryans" should be silenced, simply because of who or what they are? Given that I've modded for a number of conservative groups elsewhere, I'm going to feel very comfortable saying "good luck finding that." 

My position is that *nobody* should be treated that way. Your position is that as a Nazi, you'll be a victim if I'm treated like a human being. Could you be more entitled?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Oh my heart goes out to you, you poor abused thing. Truly, you suffer at  the hands of this unfeeling machine, long since perverted into a tool  of your tribe. 

&amp;#x200B;

What machine would that be? Twitter? When, exactly, did Twitter become a tool of the tribe of Judah?

&amp;#x200B;

See: Twitter's anti-Semitism problem.

&amp;#x200B;

There's [a lot more](https://www.google.com/search?q=Twitter+antisemitism) where that came from. 17.7 million hits showing up at the moment, more than one such report for each Jewish man, woman and child alive, today. Imagine how exhausting dealing with can get. But you, apparently you are supposed to be thought of as a victim, because as you go out to harass other people just for existing, that you're not seeing your obnoxiousness validated.

That's really taking entitlement to the next level.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Lord, it is *so* hilarious to see  the pathological censorship fomented so vigorously by america's  cosmopolitan parasite class turn and bite the hand that feeds it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What, exactly, is your reason for believing any of this nonsense? Aside, I mean, from the very likely one that you're an incel who wants somebody to scapegoat for his failure to win the attention of the women he desires, because bizarre fantasies about Jewish plots to "get black men on top of white women" (yes I've heard that line) are easier for you to live with than the reality that you are the problem in your own life, that you are a vicious little coward who attacks others who've never done him a moment's harm, safely hidden behind a pseudonym on the Internet. 

**News flash:** You're not getting shunned by women because the "cosmopolitan globalist Zionist Joos" are trying to wipe out the white race through migration, interbreeding, the fluoridation of their water, or whatever you're claiming we're up to, this week. You're getting shunned because you're a sorry excuse for a man.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Oh how they kvetch. "Why does it persecute me so! Oh lawd it's liderally anuddah shoah! The Nazis are coming for us!" Do go on. 

&amp;#x200B;

How about if I just block you? We're not going to have a reasonable discussion, and I shouldn't have to put up with your harassment. Go on ranting and raving like the lunatic you are, I just won't hear about it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Note to the rest of the group:** I see that while I'm getting upvoted, hardly anybody is speaking up. Thank you for the upvotes, but the silence makes me wonder if there's something about Reddit I should know. Have I wandered into the wrong site?</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Thank you for sharing that fantasy of yours, really, but you're setting up a straw man, and supporting it with a delusional conspiracy theory.

No fantasy of mine. I have no fondness for Austrian painters. Or losers. It is the well known fantasy of some among the many lying "holocaust survivors" accepted as gospel among American academia.

&gt;Fascinating logic. Would you care to tell me where or when I said that white people or "Aryans" should be silenced, simply because of who or what they are? Given that I've modded for a number of conservative groups elsewhere, I'm going to feel very comfortable saying "good luck finding that." My position is that nobody should be treated that way. Your position is that as a Nazi, you'll be a victim if I'm treated like a human being. Could you be more entitled?

If you're not aware of the media conglomerate's hostility to White racial consciousness and the well being of White people in general, then that supposed ashkenazi IQ is doing you no favors. Most likely you know and just play coy. Typical tricks.

And then of course, there's your little N word. Funny that you would assume immediately that I belong to one specific country that ousted their semitic enemies, out of the over 100 that expelled the jews by name. Your petty names have no power here. "If you're treated like a human being." Hilarious strawman, retard. I expected better. If you were held to the same standard as we are, Zionism would be a federal crime instead of the most corrupt and monied corporate and government agenda in the world. How's that for being treated like a human being?

&gt;tWitTer'S aNTiSemiTiSm PrOBLeM.

Do you get banned from Twitter for trying to bring attention to crimes committed against jewish women? For celebrating jewish history? No? Then shut the fuck up, kikel. Get in line.

&gt;Scapegoat for your failures

I'm living the dream. And with regard to women specifically, they have been abundant to the point of annoyance. You're just objectively wrong. Such an ignorant race smh.

&gt;jewish plots to get black men on top of white women

Probably because Mindgeek and its subsidiaries are entirely owned and operated by jews lmao. The entire porn industry literally consists of jews trying to get black men on top of white women. That's no theory.

&gt;You attack others who've never done a moment's harm

Holodomor. Just to name one of many. Filthy rat.

&gt;You're a sorry excuse for a man

Says the inbred rat lmao post physique

&gt;Oy vey I'm not getting enough validation replies for my genetic schizophrenia! Have I wandered onto the wrong site?

Yes. We are not obligated to humor your hostile delusions. This does not belong to you.</div>

It would be preferable if this feedback was done via subreddit modmail or the pinned feedback thread, because it's only fair to give the rest of the moderators a chance to review this. nevertheless.

/r/Twitter gets an extraordinary amount of posts from people who have had their Twitter accounts suspended, and they seem to think that if they post a brand new thread about it they're going to get help.

Well, this is absolutely not the case. When 20 threads a day are posted about suspended accounts, none of them get answered. I've decided to help the community by centralizing these discussions in a pinned thread and by encouraging the community to provide self-support there. 

Answers given in the new /r/Twitter FAQ describes the intent behind this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/wiki/faq

I'm gently pushing everyone to post about their account suspension issues in our pinned threads. All other threads dealing with those issues are locked and removed. Moderation feedback is *more than welcome* in the pinned thread. This is hardly censorship.

    <div class="md">This absolutely is censorship, with a side order of strawmanning. Whether talking about the bigotry of Twitter's staff will get them to back off from their bigotry is irrelevant. The subject merits comment and has merited it, for some time.

How interesting that you want to resort to procedural gameplaying in order to shut down that discussion before it ever has a chance to start.</div>

    <div class="md">I just saw your edit. Yes, riffic, I am calling you an anti-Semite. I'll stand by that, and wonder out loud if you really think that you're fooling anybody when you pretend that you're not. I also notice that you shut down the discussion in r/Twitter in order to give yourself [the last word](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/lmzfja/one_of_the_latest_scary_scary_accounts_to_get/gnyk9qf/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so I'll post my reply to you, here.

&gt;I'm a system administrator. Heuristics while it may be a fancy word to you, is just [another day to day word to those writing spam filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).

LOL. That's your bragging point? You design spam filters? Those things that are famous for not working?

You might as well have bragged about your mastery of the art of snake oil distillation. Great job failing to address [the OP's point](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/lmzfja/one_of_the_latest_scary_scary_accounts_to_get/gnyjsp1/), by the way.</div>

&amp;#x200B;

Sunlight is the best disinfectant. It's a cliche, but it's true. The fact that you want everything discussed in private, where nobody else can see what's going on, doesn't cast your moderation in a better light. Neither do trollish responses like this one.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I don't think their point needs to be addressed at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's take a look at what [my point](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/lmzfja/one_of_the_latest_scary_scary_accounts_to_get/gnyjsp1/) was, and how in context, your response made no sense, at all. I'll quote myself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To date, the only content of  mine on this site that has been removed has been removed by you.  
&gt;  
&gt;*"There's a good chance their content will be removed automatically just based on heuristics/pattern matching."*  
&gt;  
&gt;Ooh. Fancy word. [Let's look it up.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Heuristic&amp;oldid=1005406766)  
&gt;  
&gt;*"A  heuristic technique, or a heuristic (/hjʊəˈrɪstɪk/; Ancient Greek:  εὑρίσκω, heurískō, 'I find, discover'), is any approach to problem  solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not  guaranteed to be optimal, perfect, or rational, but is nevertheless  sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal or approximation."*  
&gt;  
&gt;In  other words, what you're saying is "like his account is new and stuff,  so his posts would get removed because reasons." The use of that ten  dollar word adds nothing to the meaning of what you just said. It's as  empty headed when said in big words as it is when said in short ones.  
&gt;  
&gt;Everybody's account was a new one at some point. That's not a valid reason to delete anything.

&amp;#x200B;

My point was that you were tossing word salad. That you were trying to make a silly argument sound more solid than it was by using a big word where it was not needed. That doesn't make you a deep thinking professional. That makes you a pseudo-intellectual.

You then threw a fit about the fact that I pointed out the lack of substance in what you had to say, saying that you were a big important system administrator and that big words were part of your job. You then locked the discussion before anybody could reply to your non-defense of your indefensible actions, or downvote your comments, any more.

Bear is right. What we're hearing out of you is a non sequitur, something that does not follow. See how that works, riffic? When I use big words, I don't use them to try to intimidate the more suggestible reader into not questioning what I have to say, or distract him from some lack of substance in my arguments. I use them because they're useful, and I'm happy to explain those words as well as I can. I'm equally happy to admit that I'm not always the best man for the job, because my degree will be in Mathematics, not English, but I will do my best.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

You're not important, you're not impressive, you're just pathetic. But then, bigots like you tend to be. Maybe that's why you're bigots.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh - and here was the tail end of the comment I posted back on r/Twitter.

 

&gt;Oh, by the way - my karma score just  rose to 10. No great significance to that, but I am mildly amused by the  fact that your abuse of power is the reason it got there. Sort of  ironic, given the fact that you're the one who tried to base an ad  hominem on the fact that my karma was below 10.  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you want to call me a "peasant," now?

&amp;#x200B;

Make that 39, as of this morning. I find this pleasing, because it's good to see that people on this site are empathetic. I also find it amusing, because while it doesn't affect my sense of self - I'm the same guy I was before I got upvoted - I can tell that this sort of thing affects Riffic's sense of self.

If people were wondering why I was talking about "peasants"  in my comment, probably because they were out having more fun than I was back in 2017, it's a Christian Burns reference. Christian Burns was an Instagram model who loudly abused a security guard at Vidcon, calling him a "peasant" because the security guard did his job and telling him to kill himself, because he was so blue collar and not famous, like the model. The incident went viral, the guard ended up with more followers than Burns, and Burns then deleted his account.

Riffic reminds me of Christian Burns.</div>

    <div class="md">The reason that modmail is a preferred channel is because [I'm not the only moderator of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/about/moderators). If you don't mind, I would prefer my actions to be reviewed by [the other moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/about/moderators) and it is only fair to allow the other moderators this chance to review. I haven't even been a moderator in that sub a full month - if this is how it's going to be I would rather just demoderate myself now rather than deal with this sort of garbage.

Now, if you may, I am done interacting with you and any other actor here because all you've done is thrown around allegations of impropriety and bigotry without substance.

Most threads here in /r/RedditCensors seem to be about subreddit bans. You have not been banned from /r/Twitter for any reason and this is just an overreaction about a thread removal.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;You're clearly a nut job.

Says the person who flies into hysteria on the sight of a Jew. This has been different, but I think this is where I block you. I also think, maybe, this is where I leave the group.

When people can post hateful, unhinged comments like you have, and for days the only criticism of those comments comes from a Jew and from somebody who has Jewish relatives, that suggests to me that Jews for the most part aren't welcome on this group. That people like you speak for most of the membership, and that's why the people who gave me the upvotes have been silent. They're afraid to speak up, because they think that if they did, that they'd end up with targets on their backs.

A pro-free speech group where people are afraid to speak up. That's a thought, isn't it? Bye, "Adolf." I won't miss you. I wonder if anybody ever would.</div>
