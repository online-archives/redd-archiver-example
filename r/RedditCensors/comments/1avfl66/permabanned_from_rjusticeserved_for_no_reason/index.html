    <div class="md">Hell I like Destiny the most since he is more facts based than tyt, TimCast, and Joe Rogan. Might not like his social politics but Tim and the others do look at favorable statistics at times to back their reporting. Destiny at least tries to be impartial and factual at news and is very open that his politics are his opinion and sometimes not fact based.</div>

    <div class="md">tyt is a joke lmao. only politics guy i watch is sfo. destiny is pretty chill though i have a lot of respect for him even if i disagree with him on a good amount of issues. i have a great appreciation for how he comes to his own conclusions rather than parroting the narrative like ben shapiro and hasan do. joe rogan is also similar to that, although i don’t think politics is his thing. he doesn’t strike me as the type of guy to do research on topics. but still, a man of integrity.</div>

    <div class="md">I try to look at all sides I disagree with tyt most of the time but trying to informed on all stances can help me form better political opinions. And Hasan is a joke of a political streamers his takes are one dimensional, overly emotional and any dissent leads to him calling opponents a fascist/racist/phobic. At least with Ben he studies his sources (still think he does the wrong takes and conclusions) and is some what routed in facts. But Destiny is my favorite because he will admit his biases and tries to be impartial</div>
