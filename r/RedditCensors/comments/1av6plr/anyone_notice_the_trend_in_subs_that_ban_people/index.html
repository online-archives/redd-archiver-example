    <div class="md">I feel like they actually scaled it back after Elon got twitter.  You used to get insta-banned for saying anything against the rainbow mafia before that happened.  Then once the twitter docs came out about the collusion between big tech and the left, they eased up on the bans to not attract suspicion.  They are definitely cranking up the bans ahead of election season though to make their unpopular views seem more popular than they actually are.</div>

    <div class="md">One of my favorite people said “Woke culture is a cannibalistic suicide cult”. 

A little extreme, but it’s very true. I saw a thread the other day from a trans person who decided to de-transition because they realized they were pressured by their friend group in the first place. The comments were filled with so many liberals screaming like it’s impossible. 

Also saw another with a married couple, man and trans woman, who were both conservative and it was some of the most insane hate speech I’ve ever seen against a happy marriage from the left lol. It’s very transparent how insecure they are in their beliefs. It’s all posturing.</div>

    <div class="md">The lefts message doesn't sell well. It looks good on paper but often these ideals break down under things like facts and questions. That's ok because ideas are best ran through with debate in the marketplace of ideas. However for some reason the left doesn't want to do it that way. They would rather block, bully and belittle anyone not following their dogma.</div>

    <div class="md">I think it sells well.  But the parts of it that are more unpopular generally get amplified by bad actors who use them as wedge issues.  Economically, it makes no sense to subscribe to conservative politics unless you’ve already got your bag and want a status quo situation.  Bust most conservatives I know are conservative because of identity politics - they were raised that way or they can’t separate their religious identity from their political selves.</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t think you feel me brother. 

This isn’t one side is worse than the other. It’s that both sides have the exact same controllers at the top and they take turns being in power. They have the same vested interests, which is money, power and fascism (dictionary definition). Only reason they didn’t censor as much back then is because we didn’t have social media and so many opportunities to be censored. 

Do not glorify the right wing as if they weren’t just as big of warhawks demonic fuckheads when 9/11 happened, like the left is now currently embodying. It is all controlled by bankers, financial kingpins, corporate fat cats, career politicians who maintain the status quo etc… love your fellow citizen and hate the people who pull the strings.</div>

    <div class="md">>But you're a Nazi if you have your own

Well, when "your own" feelings are *direct reflections of Nazi ideology*, umm, yes.

(This is not directed at you, this is a general statement. I don't have time to read post histories.)</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t think it’s a one-sided issue, either, but Reddit is a predominately left-leaning website—I think that likely skews users’ perceptions, especially given that some of the highest-traffic boards have fairly strict moderation policies. 

So far as I can recall, even boards that were once more inviting of debate and rounded discussion no longer allow many topics that have been deemed “off-limits” by liberal activists. 

And to be perfectly clear, I myself am fairly liberal—I’m just not a big fan of people being censored for asking questions, or having opinions different from my own. 

How are we supposed to learn, or at least inform our perspectives, if some of the most active spaces on this website intentionally stifle discourse? 

Obviously there are other resources, online and in libraries, but it’s a bit obnoxious to see posts regularly deleted for raising questions. </div>

    <div class="md">You are right, but you are also somewhat off.  The conservative right is as you say, very religious and believe in bans on things their brand of religion does not agree with.  That said, they are more pro free speech.  But the real point I wanted to make is that classical liberals, and libertarians have also now been grouped in with the right wing, and these two groups do believe in freedom.  Basically anybody who actually believes in personal freedoms is cast out from the left and labeled right wing, so in that respect the vast majority of those believing in freedom are called right wing.</div>

    <div class="md">No. Property rights are very important to me. As are speech and association rights. But I think each person should get to choose whether they tune in or tune out to what others are saying. The person I'm replying to wants to stop it. Stop it from happening on a sub they are just a member of. But not with winning hearts and minds. He wants to end it with authority. Demenstrating Group Think and the Tyranny of the Majority. Think of the Reddit hivemind and how erratic it is. That is the downside of democracy. And there is a downside and it is okay to talk about. Democracy is an amoral system, not some dogmatic icon of ultimate good. Thankfully, rights are enshrined in our Republic as inherent and not open to popular vote.</div>

There were an overwhelming number of people who upvoted to like +60 then I was brigaded down by more people to -30ish. It’s clear that some people agreed that it is getting out of hand on that sub, and then the mods sided with thieves. It’s garbage.</div>

    <div class="md">You're not wrong but right leaning subs, that exist to talk about right wing ideas, are between a rock and a hard place with the overall reddit user base.


With no or minimal moderation they at-best become partisan debate subs and at worst get taken over by bad-faith actors and become a hate subreddit to bash the very idea like-minded people intended to discuss positively among themselves.


With excessive moderation it effectively turns into a private club for people who think *exactly* like the mods with many like-minded people getting banned for failing the moderators purity test. 


I think the "mods private club" version is the motivation behind much of the left-leaning subs banning of people more so than a fear of being brigaded by an overwhelming number of right-wingers who change the nature of the subreddit. </div>

    <div class="md">As a conservative Trump supporter who knows the virus didn’t come from a wet market and that we were lied to about social distancing, masks, and the vaccine.

I can tell you it’s been this way for more than 5 years already.

Liberals need full control so nothing can be discussed, debated, or sorted out. 

And the whole reason I open with that description of myself is because despite my thoughts on all of those things, I wouldn’t ever want to ban or silence or harass anyone who thinks differently to me.

But when I question their information, or find conflicting information, it’s a band from their side of the table. 

They say us Trump supporters are bigots but these people like to eat alone so badly they won’t even pass the salt.</div>

    <div class="md">Who’s trying to silence you? Is banning you from a subreddit the “left” controlling you?

I just find it sad that you’ll look at some random dumb liberals on the internet and let that form the entire view of the democratic party for you. There’s not a single elected democrat that doesn’t want you to have a voice.

Meanwhile if the libs say the republicans are all Jan 6 wuhan covid whackos, then they’re all just full of hate and controlling. Meanwhile there are literal elected republicans talking about “eliminating” or “removing” the enemy(liberals).

How is that not the same thing?</div>

    <div class="md">Go post on news with republican talking points and see if you make it through the day without getting banned. I'm not even republican or right wing either, I just asked how they knew that person was a republican. Do your own research. This place is an echo chamber, and If you are arguing it's not you are arguing in bad faith and I have to assume you're a troll</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not saying it's not an echo chamber. What I am saying is proof that Democrats control a large portion of reddit doesn't exist. It just simply doesn't. There is no way to quantify that data. Your singular instance does not just paint all of Reddit. The fact you aren't providing any data/facts/literally anything other than calling me a troll and repeating you aren't Republican shows that you can't prove that Democrats control reddit. That's my whole point. Again I don't give a fuck about politics. You're the one who keeps repeating you aren't Republican lol I just want a data sheet literally anything that can provide actual evidence. I'm not even trying to disprove anything I just want the evidence.</div>

    <div class="md">Not asking for a big CNN news article. That's called conjecture. I'm asking for any proof. Any. At all. A datasheet from any relevant place. You're also signaling by using CNN instead of the word news lol. Haven't specified any places. Just asked for proof. You're actively admitting you just believe Reddit is majority Democrat controlled with no real proof. That's my point. Anyway no point in going in a circle. Cause I am just going to continue to ask for proof and you're just going to continue to admit you have none. Might as well just end it. Have a good day boss</div>

    <div class="md">Lol imagine this argument in any other scenario. 

Who gets cancer is decided by the left. Well yea there's no proof but anyone with eyes can see the left picks who gets cancer. 

That's the argument you're making. You're expecting to be believed with no facts. No proof. Then when asked for proof you admit none exists but your belief is still valid while turning to minor insults.

Yet I'm the one with my head in the sand. 

Got it.</div>

    <div class="md">Not even remotely true. We're looking at the night sky together and you're telling me stars are actually just flashlights in the sky. Algorithms change everyone's social media to curate what the algorithm thinks they want. What's weird is it's 2024 and you are acting like you don't know this. Additionally posts made by users of a subreddit are no indication of what the political affiliation of the moderators of that sub reddit are. Go to any veterans or military sub. You're believing the bogeyman theory lol</div>

    <div class="md">isn't this what reddit's been since 2015 or so? and before then, wasn't it just an insufferable hivemind?

I remember a friend of mine (who used to regularly use reddit) becoming a communist for a week in 2014 because of the site. I remember the montageparody guys being all gatekeepy and denying a friend's submission because it made fun of one of their sacred memes for half a second. I remember the gaming subreddit raiding a (13-year-old) friend's twitch channel in 2013 and telling him to do stuff like "twerk to gasolina" and "bite your lips seductively".</div>

    <div class="md">It's social media in more broadly.  Twitter was working with the FBI to eliminate "fake news", Facebook removes posts and suspends accounts all the time.

Tik Tok is a shitstorm of bad leftist opinions screamed by 14 year olds.

Remember that the Reformation was a mere 63 years after Gutenberg's Bible.  The Web and broadband happened relatively recently, ubiquitous smart phones are going to have a drastic effect.</div>

    <div class="md">1: Reddit has always leaned left in general. Lots of women and young college aged people use it, and those crowds also both lean left.

2: Conservative censorship is as bad if not worse. r/conservative will ban you for literally anything that goes against their narrative.

3: A lot of right wing posters violate basic rules of reddit by falling into bigoted language or using hate speech. This parlance is common on the right, but is against the general rules of society.</div>
