      <div class="md">Like the title says, I was permanently banned from this sub which I have been posting to for over 2 years. No explanation given. The most recent content I posted there was TJDS and others on topic of FTV. I know each time I post Jimmy Dore content or content from any likeminded leftist, the thread is filled with users who just shit on the content creators or myself for posting them but never actually address what they disagree about in terms of the points or arguments made within the segments. So mods do nothing about this behavior but ban me for posting content from leftists (who promoted FTV and dare to criticize the dem party and even the squad from the left) because I probably get a bunch of reports for posting it by the pro censorship anti Dore left who can't stand alternative views and mods finally gave in or perhaps they feel the same. I don't know. I can only speculate, they never gave me a reason. So much for open debate though. Another leftist sub falls to dem loyalist/apologia pressure, assuming mods weren't already co-opted. Edit: I replied to the ban message asking what I did to deserve the ban, but did not get a response and still haven't days later. And I have posted Dore  there in the past and the recent Dore / FTV posts are still up as of writing this.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Or maybe, perhaps, you post rubbish that mods don’t want on their sub. 

Anyone here can search my username  author:karmagheden over there and see I have posted plenty of quality content. And I would argue even the small minority of posts that are sitting at 0 (and were seemingly downvote brigaded) aren't even rubbish content, just like with my recent pro FTV posts there. You disliking the content I post, doesn't make it rubbish or banworthy and who is upvoting your censorship apologia?

&gt;Looking at r/RedditCensors you post here a lot about being permanently banned from other subs. 

Because I have been banned from a bunch of subs and unreservedly so and my guess is at least some of this has to do with targeted downvotes and report abuse. Users here can look at my past posts in redditcensors and decide for themselves if they think the bans were warranted, but I would not be posting here if I thought they were. And I'm not sure why you seem to be pretending like you are just coming across me now for the first time and didn't know I have been banned from a bunch of places, you and I have a history i.e. you used to follow me from the politicalvideo sub to leftist politics subs that I posted to and you would just shit talk me and the creators of the content I posted, and I was coincidently banned from those subs including politicalvideo. I wonder if you reported me / the content I posted in the hopes to get the it removed / me banned. I wouldn't be surprised and it would make it extra fucked up that you come here now and be upvoted for basically saying I'm imagining mod abuse and that the bans were deserved. Anyways, just to give readers here some background on how you would troll my posts. 

&gt;It’s almost as if you’re the one doing something wrong. It might be worth considering at least, the idea that you’re incorrect about… well pretty much everything you complain about here.

This is you gaslighting and projecting.</div>

And I would argue even the small minority of posts that are sitting at 0 (and were seemingly downvote brigaded) aren't even rubbish content, just like with my recent pro FTV posts there.

It seems there are many, many, mods that disagree with you. Again, maybe, just perhaps you’re posting trash and might not be aware of it. Although I doubt it considering there are probably people pointing out that your posts are trash on a daily basis. 

&gt;Because I have been banned from a bunch of subs and unreservedly so and my guess is at least some of this has to do with targeted downvotes and report abuse.

A report is sent to mods and/or admins where they make a determination on whether the reported content should remain on a sub or the site at large. There is no targeted abuse in this equation, get over yourself. You post garbage and it is probably dealt with accordingly. 


&gt;Users here can look at my past posts 

I remember you once invited me to do the same until I started calling out the bullshit you were spouting in other places and you began to complain that I “followed you” to other subs to harass you. Bit of a bitch move if you ask me, but you never really struck me as a person of integrity. 

&gt;but I would not be posting here if I thought they were. 

Just curious if you believe any ban you have ever got was warranted in your mind, or are the mods always wrong and you’re always right?


&gt;you and I have a history 

That’s a charitable way of putting it. I called out your shit for a while when it was showing up on my feed multiple times a day. As far as I’m concerned you’re just another voice in the chorus of idiots. The only noticeable difference is that your specific brand of stupid seems to always align with Russian interests, almost statistically impossible to accidentally do that as many times as I saw it. 


&gt;i.e. you used to follow me from the politicalvideos sub to leftist politics subs that I posted to and you would just shit talk me and the creators of the content I posted

Still trying to play the poor victim card on that I see. You invited me to look through your post history, I found more examples of what I was talking about and pointed it out to you. Toddlers have more nuance than you and your childish crap. 


&gt;and I was coincidently banned from those subs along with politicalvideos. I wonder if you reported me / the content I posted in the hopes to get the it removed / me banned. 

Again, maybe… just maybe, perhaps there is the slightest chance that it was the content of your posts and comments that got you banned from various subs. I have no power to remove anyone or anything from any sub. 


&gt;I wouldn't be surprised and it would make it extra fucked up that you come here now and be upvoted for basically saying I'm imagining mod abuse and that the bans were deserved. Anyways, just to give readers here some background on how you would troll my posts.

The victim mentality doing mental gymnastics is extra thick here. I mean, mod abuse? Mod abuse directed pretty much exclusively at you? Like the mods are all power mad, but mostly targeting only you. Mods are people and they don’t owe you shit. If you want to post garbage and disinformation on their space, then you also have to live with the consequences that go along with that behaviour. For a better view of the problem look inward. 

&gt;This is you gaslighting and projecting.

Because you’re always right and everyone that disagrees is always wrong? Just like those pesky mods that are all abusing you for no reason. How many times in the last month have you accused someone of projecting? Seems like “projecting” has been stuck in your word of the day calendar for years. Although I could be wrong, maybe… perhaps, it’s just possible that you dusted off that old classic because you’re talking to me. 

See what I did there? I made allowances for the possibility that I’m wrong about something. Although I’m pretty confident that I wouldn’t have to look too far through your history to find someone calling out your shit and you replying with the word projection. 

How do they say smell ya later in Russia?</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t know, I just can’t see Jimmy Dore typing and posting as much as op has. @libtard01 on Twitter seems extremely low effort in comparison. My theory is that both Jimmy and op are paid by the same people. And I’m only subscribing to that theory because the idea that op is really this stupid and actually believe all the nonsense they espouse, is just a little bit too sad to be real. But then again the whole Jimmy Dore grift is a bit too sad to be real, so I can easily see why someone would figure them to be the same sad person.</div>

Just looking at that sub I’d say you probably have a better handle on how Jimmy expresses himself in writing and maybe have a point about op. Perhaps they are all the same person, the same sad, sad, person.</div>
