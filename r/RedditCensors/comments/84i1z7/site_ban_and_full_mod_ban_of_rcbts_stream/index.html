    <div class="md">If we can use throwaways to hit the trigger words all over subreddits on the brink of ban, that trigger the bayesian classifiers (ml algs) that report content over threshold for abeyance of reddit policy, thus causing admins to ban hundreds more subreddits, then that's a feedback loop that could result in an exponential solution.  The artful troll uses the energy of the opponent against themselves.  Each new subreddit banned throws a fresh supply of gasoline (anger being the key ingredient to virality) on the fire.   

The advertisers who initially posed the little ultimatum on reddit who started this little kerfuffle are going to be sorry they brought it up and just wish we went back to earlier times.  We're way past that jerry, come on out.

    <div class="md">Never forget, when the admins announced their new "site-wide rule" against calls to violence, there was a very well researched post with links to the dozens of left-leaning subs that are guilty of constant and consistent calls to violence.

That post was not only deleted by the admins, the reddotor's password was changed. They didn't even ban him, as that would have left even more evidence of their hypocrisy and complete lack of integrity.

As with all of the admin's nebulous, extremely selectively enforced "rules", this one is just being used as an incredibly lame excuse to axe the subs they are politically / monetarily opposed to.

It is in no way a "site-wide" rule if it is, oh so transparently, used to censor *only subs they don't like*.</div>

    <div class="md">Pretty hard to tell.. from what I've seen they aren't any more accurate than, say, Andrea Chalupa or Louise Mensch. They make a lot of vague accusations or claims, and then sometimes something happens shortly after. Their supporters take that as evidence that they're in the know. Other things they say are too vague to be able to tell, and their supporters believe that they're talking in code. AFAIK there hasn't been a major, unmistakeable leak from Qanon, but according to their supporters they can't publicly leak because then the opposition would know that they know - so it's sort of a catch-22. In my personal opinion it doesn't seem to much matter whether the Q poster is legit or just a charismatic channer because of that</div>
