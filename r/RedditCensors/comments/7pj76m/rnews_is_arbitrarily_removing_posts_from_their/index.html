    <div class="md">From the Wikipedia definition:

Censorship is the suppression of speech, public communication, or other information, on the basis that such material is considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, politically incorrect or "inconvenient" as determined by government authorities or by community consensus.

Sounds like the community in question is the /r/news mods, and they have a consensus that a secret list of domains is not allowed. The fact that they won't even share it makes it even worse, hence my use of "of the highest order."</div>

    <div class="md">I used to think /r/The_Donald also was big on censorship. But then I looked in to their rules and realized they aren't censoring. They're enforcing their publicly available rules. Right in the sidebar it clearly states that /r/The_Donald is for Trump fans, and if you aren't a fan of Trump, don't post there.

If /r/WorldNews, /r/news, and /r/politics got honest one day and added a rule in their sidebar that said "Anything you post here that doesn't align with our political agenda will be removed." then it would no longer be censorship. It'd just be rules enforcement.

It's not important what the sources are or which sub they're being posted to. If it isn't against the rules and they're just being removed that's censorship, and that's what I'm against. Not because I like Hilary or I think the Mueller investigation is shit or for any reason that ties me to a particular political side. It's not that at all. It's because I think people should decide for themselves what they think is right or wrong, when they're on a sub that doesn't bill itself as being completely one-sided. </div>
