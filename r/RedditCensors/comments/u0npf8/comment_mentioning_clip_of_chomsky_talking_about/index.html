    <div class="md">Dude one of the stories my mom told me about her trip to Europe in the early 90s was about going to Germany. She was staying with a family in some small town and everyone was so nice and treated her with respect. Then with three nights to go until she travels to the next country this old grandpa, who was of course such a nice old man, got drunk and started going on about how the holocaust was a lie and he never sided with hitler but never saw any of what happened to the Jews so he still thinks it’s all propaganda hogwash. My mother was assured by the people more of her age that grandpa was just old like that but the damage was done. There are a mountain of trolls out there but there are also very real people that think it really is just one massive lie.</div>
