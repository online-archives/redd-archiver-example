    <div class="md">Those aren't the places to do it. I'd be willing to put money down on a bet that the majority of comments on all of those subs are from bot accounts. [If you look at many top voted comments, it's blatantly obvious](https://ibb.co/WgyS5KF) either bots or paid promoters are dead front and center, and all other narratives literally have mobilized opposition. I can probably dig through my screenshots and find other times where I've received verbatim replies from separate accounts, either from a script for a human or robot.</div>
