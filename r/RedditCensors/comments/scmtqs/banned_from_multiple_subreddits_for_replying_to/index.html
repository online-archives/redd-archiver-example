    <div class="md">You posted/commented in a counter-narrative subreddit and have now experienced what they do - your account was automatically banned by bots and you now can’t post in a number of subreddits.

Now apply/extend that silencing mechanism to all users and consider why the conversation on this platform is now all one-sided and fosters conformity rather than a free exchange of ideas. 

The up/down voting already fostered conformity. It’s a popularity contest - you get rewarded for sharing posts and comments that “everybody knows” are true. Conversely you get punished with downvotes for going against any popular opinion. 

By banning accounts with “unpopular” opinions, the net effect is creating a filter bubble / echo chamber that manufactures consent and conformity. 

Any “unpopular” opinion will never get an opportunity to be evaluated and/or replace the popular opinion.

This makes reddit a great tool for any large-scale propaganda campaign. Other platforms are now suffering from similar issues. Once you silence dissent, you’re only left with “everybody knows” and pay-for-play content, AKA propaganda.

    <div class="md">I responded critically to a post in one of those anti-lockdown subs as well, and was met with a barrage of bans from a ton of random subs. I of course responded to each something to the effect of, “go fuck yourself, I’ll ‘participate in’ whatever conversations I damn well please,” and was naturally suspended from Reddit for 3 days.

Fuck this site.</div>

    <div class="md">Same. My response to their harassment (getting unsolicited DMs from subs I’ve never participated in, for voicing opinions they don’t like, is absolutely harassment) resulted in them reporting me to Reddit admins for harassment. After receiving a warning, I counter-complained through their online complaint form that they were harassing me, stating that I would never had exchanged expletives with them had they not harassed me first, and this resulted in an automatic response by Reddit stating that they don’t investigate individual complaints for the behavior of moderator groups. Fuck this site indeed.</div>

    <div class="md">Lol, I've been getting a shit ton of these today.  Apparently the purple headed Xes are doing bans  in all their favorite subs if you even post something somewhere they don't like.  It's funny considering I'm not even in most of the subs they're banning me from.  

Typical leftists, if you don't blindly agree with their narrative they do their best to silence you.  I consider it a badge of honor to be blocked from their echo chambers.</div>
