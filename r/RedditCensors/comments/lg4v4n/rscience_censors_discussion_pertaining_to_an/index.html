    <div class="md">r/science removes a ton of comments in the vast majority of the posts there. It's nothing special about this particular post. They constantly post  propaganda "studies"  very obviously pushing pro democrat agendas and there's usually a fair amount of people there who call these posts out.

I was actually surprised when I saw they posted something not painting conservatives in a bad light.</div>
