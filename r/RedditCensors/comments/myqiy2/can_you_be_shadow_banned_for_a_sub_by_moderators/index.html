    <div class="md">Yes, I had this happen to me over at Democrats, liberal and progressive and then got banned when I inquired why my posts weren't showing up, and often when I was simply defending myself from ad hominem attacks or defending my wrongthink positions with reputable citation. I had posts to other subs not show up, like over at politics and I assumed it was the automod algorithm to censor certain words and phrases but when I inquired, *if* I heard back, they would act ignorant (maybe they were) say I got caught up as spam or they would say it's a site wide admin censorship/shadow ban and that I should talk to *them* about it. In many cases I would ask then if I could have my post approved and they would either not respond or arbitrarily use/stretch the rules with interpretation to back up the algorithm of the automod to justify the removal. That also was an issue, as I remember a while back one of the new people working at Reddit had a history with the intel community and they used a site wide automod to remove any mention of her name. So I think it's pretty clear there's biased mods all over the place abusing their power but more importantly there appear to be conflict of interest / compromised mods who act and post and mod as if they are dem operatives with intent to silence wrongthink and help to control the narrative and conversation and this works in tandem with astroturf and vote manipulation / brigading / forum slide etc to suppress wrongthink and prop up official talking points that manufacture consent and often gaslight.</div>
