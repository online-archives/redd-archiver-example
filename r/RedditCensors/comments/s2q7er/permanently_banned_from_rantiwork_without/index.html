      <div class="md">Messaged the mods but haven't heard back. I posted there earlier in this thread:

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/s1w6rq/something_tells_me_dr_fauci_has_either_reached/

Some user wrote: 

&gt;Dr. Fauci has been working in a hostile work environment too long and Republican Senator Rand Paul has created a toxic work environment.

I replied:

&gt;/s ?

They replied:

&gt;?

I replied back: 

&gt;Hostile work environment **like Fauci working to smear other scientists?** Ran Paul creating a toxic working environment **by calling out Fauci on his lies/deception?** Come on. Do you get outside of politics and other shitlib echochambers that are establishment dem propaganda boards?

Comment was removed.

Those are both facts btw and did they just permanently ban me for calling the politics sub a shitlib echochamber? I'm a leftist and I am aware of that fact. I guess per the rules there you are not allowed to flame users. What exactly constitutes flaming and how am I flaming this user by asking them if they post outside establishment dem propagandized echochambers like politics?? Oh, rule 10: "**No calling-out other users or subreddits.** Do not leave reddit usernames visible in screenshots or links. Do not post content with the purpose of antagonizing other subreddits." So I unknowingly violated that rule and they couldn't give me a warning or temp ban? What a ridiculous rule btw where you can't even mention another subreddit negatively, without getting a permanent ban. Thought-police extravaganza with those list of rules. Anti-work, but still authoritarian.

Messaged back by mods:

&gt;No you were banned for rule 4. I am assuming some antivaxx or covid denialism going on?



I replied with:

&gt;I'm not anti-vax. I've been jabbed 3 times now. I just got my booster last weekend.

&gt;And where did I violate rule 4? I said Fauci lied, right and worked to discredit other scientists?

&gt;https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/fauci-lies-about-lying-about-the-efficacy-of-masks

&gt;So there is no covid denialism or anti-vax sentiment in my comment and I just backed up my assertions, can you kindly lift my ban or explain what I have done to deserve a permanent ban.

They replied with:

&gt;1) Fuck those "experts" who argued against lock downs, they're part of why we're still in this miss. 2) https://twitter.com/Brandonn_Ralph/status/1451069733231636481/photo/1 3) The MSN one and the Washington Examiner are just the same thing, lol 4) The comment on PPEs makes total sense to me and you'd want to prioritize those on the front lines of COVID rather than people who should be locking down anyways.

&gt;Begone.

Then:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/antiwork. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/antiwork for 28 days.

There was no covid denialism or anti-vax sentiment in my comment. I'm vaccinated. I wasn't spreading vaccine misinformation. You can find other leftist talking about these things, I have posted this content to politicalvideos, so these are not 'right-wing' or 'crazy' talking points.</div>
