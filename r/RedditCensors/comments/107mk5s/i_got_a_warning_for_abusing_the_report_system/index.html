    <div class="md">My guess is that there was a sensitive political topic surrounding the thread that the admins are invested in.  I've seen the "be civil" rules ignored, or abused depending on what the political agenda is.

Maybe they felt that the obscene image was justified because it made fun on a political enemy, and thus by reporting it, you must have been on the enemy's side.</div>
