"Facts that don’t align with what ever drivel that doesn’t align with that echo chamber’s narrative will get you banned. Such is the case with most leftist subs. The moderators all need to have a collective unbunching of their panties.”

My response was this:
"Leftist subs? Try saying anything that doesn’t involve sucking Trump’s dick on r/Conservative and see how quickly you’re banned. The right wing subs have the biggest snowflakes on this entire site. You can’t even say the sky is blue if Trump has decided he thinks it’s a different colour that day.
I love it when they haven’t got their talking points from Fox yet - you actually get some people saying reasonable things that reflect the real world as sane people see it. Then the talking points get issued and it’s all up is down, black is white, lie after lie after lie in the face of reality.”

    <div class="md">I haven't had that experience on this subreddit, but my experience on conservative was similar to yours.

A guy went through all the crappy, degrading and hateful things he had said to his family and friends about nonTrumpers.   Then, he was surprised and hurt when some of them didn't want to be around him anymore.   He didn't think it was fair.  I pointed out that their response was logical.   

Banned for me.   Lol.  And they claim the libs are snowflakes</div>
