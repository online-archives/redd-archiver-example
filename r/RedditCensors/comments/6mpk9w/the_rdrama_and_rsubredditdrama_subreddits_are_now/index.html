    <div class="md">Are you just pissy that we didn't buy your story hook line and sinker? If you're legit then that's great, but you should understand that it's important to take leaks like this with a good deal of skepticism, and that this post just makes it look like you're trying to bait us into getting banned. Also, /u/hahapointsatyou clearly told you that the admins confirmed that Tokkul was permabanned for spreading actual dox on reddit, not for sending in a media tip or exposing an alt (which we didn't even do). We just suggested that you should go to a media outlet if all of this is true, because it would make good news, and I suggested that you should confirm what you've found before you do so as not to make some random person get their shit wrecked. I'm not sure what you're trying to do here, but it's pretty sketchy tbqhwy.</div>

I mean, do you want me to ask the admins why I wasn't banned myself and post the results?

And why are you trying to get the /r/drama mods and apparently some random dude into trouble?

    <div class="md">Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most welcoming, lovely, caring online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would attack such a wholesome, sweet hub of comprehension and understanding. You think /r/rarepuppers was awesome? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Cats), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most heartwarming dog lovers, allies, milfs, and bff. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as welcoming as possible. That's intentional. They encourage hugs in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Love (it's from this underrated book "How to be a good person", give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of passionate love so they continue to adore every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these good feelings. They share love from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of voluntary workers spanning hundreds of communities, sharing lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown love movement. They've loved hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Bob Ross and Tom Hankses, and I highly suggest that everybody dares visit that awesome subreddit, for potentially falling victim to its loving spell.
