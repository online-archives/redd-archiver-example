    <div class="md">How about you stop being disingenuous?

I was curious why you didn't show the context. Didn't even have to take a few minute to call you own on this BS.

This is r/conservative's [rules](https://imgur.com/YpygkDv). Note their rule 5, and their examples and section on shit posting.

And here is your [comment](https://imgur.com/X01zDAn), with additional context to show that this is you.

At least you're true to your name, but don't complain about getting unfairly banned when there is literally a rule on this listed on their sidebar, with a link to shit post examples going to the rules page I listed.</div>

u/fastban is a 7 day account, probably made for the purpose of getting fastbanned and pulling this sort of shitty behavior. If he doesn't get what he wants, when can we expect u/fastban2?</div>

    <div class="md">ALSO, technically, you're breaking this subreddit's rules 3, 4, and 5.

&gt; * Low hanging fruit posts aren't welcomed. Going to subreddits that openly enforce an ideology to fish for a ban is not the kind of content we're after.
&gt; * Your submission of censorship should concern a subreddit that portrays itself on the surface as neutral but isn't. Such as /r/news, /r/europe, /r/worldnews, /r/technology etc.
&gt; * This sub is open for anyone to participate, but users who do so in bad faith, such as users who themselves engage in or support ideological censorship and then come here to concern troll will not be tolerated.</div>

    <div class="md">Actually, I’m not. R/conservative is a places for conservatives to discuss conservative issues. I never disagreed or tried to debate conservative principles. I merely stated my opinion about a country, and I don’t think it’s the United States job to protect countries that fund terrorism against us. If that’s not conservative, I don’t know what is. 
Low hanging fruit posts? If I went there and said the orange mans bad and I love Nancy Pelosi, then I could see how it might appear to be fishing for a ban. I didn’t. I didn’t go there with the intent to get banned, despite you taking the meaning of a reddit handle out of context. You can see my comment, and it doesn’t break any rules on r/conservative. 
What is concerning is how the mods of r/conservative would ban me for saying “fuck Saudi Arabia”. Not “Fuck America” not “Fuck Donald Trump”. But “Fuck Saudi Arabia”.  What’s even more concerning is that you don’t see it. You want to call it a shit post? Fine. Remove it. But ban me for it? That’s censorship.</div>

    <div class="md">Didn’t show the context? I posted a photo showing my comment in the imgur link! And again, it says they will be removed. Looking at it though you can say certain things like “Fuck Hilary” “Fuck liberals”. But say “fuck Saudi Arabia”? No way. They own half of the republican politicians in congress, including the president. Osama bin ladens country is sacred to them. And they won’t take slander against it. 
Maybe that goes against your world view. Personally I don’t care. I got banned for censorship, pure and simple.</div>
