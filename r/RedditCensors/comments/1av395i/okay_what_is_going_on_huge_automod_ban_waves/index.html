There seems to be some sort of power grab across popular subreddits with the goal of curated echo-chambers for liberals/leftists. For example, WhitePeopleTwitter and JusticeServed... For the record, I myself identify as a democrat but what has been going on is WAY TOO FAR. 

Only the people at reddit can actually investigate it. This deserves their full attention right away. Power-hungry mods that are just banning thousands of people for having even semi-dissenting opinions. Or like me, someone who had a level headed, non-politically charged take. 

It's getting absurd at this point. If we are not careful, Reddit will become ENTIRELY useless for any meaningful discussion and will just continue to rot public perception on key issues. Long term consequences for this site will be probably be a massive drop in users - which Reddit admins should care about. As, less users = less ad revenue. But more importantly, the dissolution of free speech, civil discussion and equitable dichotomy of opinions/perspectives. 

Please, let's bring this to the forefront. This is an incredibly important issue. If we do nothing now, it will snowball and then this website becomes only for the minority and alienates the majority.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm a centrist that leans Liberal on social topics and Conservative on financial topics. I find myself having to mute so many subreddits because of the hate going both ways. Echo chambers are terrible for growth. All you see anywhere are people name calling and misusing words because they can't have a discussion that challenges their views. Earlier I talked about how the internet likes to lump Liberals in with the far left and Conservatives in with the far right. Its a terrible thing.</div>

    <div class="md">Holy fuck are you me? YOU ARE MY PERSON.

It fucking upsets me to no end when people can’t just have a damn discussion. It ALWAYS has to resort to attacking people. People are too lazy to get their beliefs challenged, go research, reflect, and understand others point of views.

This is why I hate mainstream media. All it does is further divide everyone and ruins friendships, families, etc.

I’ve been saying this for a while but there has been a serious epidemic of people losing empathy and perspective.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah--

I'd build a site that functions like Reddit but actually allows dissenting opinions and operates from a first amendment perspective.

The only problem with that, is that you get actual Nazis that get on there and just spam some gay, 17 hour "documentary" and brigade everyone all the time so that you can't have a discussion about anything at all unless you mute or block them, which is honestly not too much to ask, because thats how we handled them back in the 90s on message boards.</div>

    <div class="md">No no, that’s fair. I’m only saying that mods shouldn’t be allowed to ban you from other subreddits that you never participated in in the first place. And they do it with an auto mod bot. Like I commented in Joe Rogan yesterday, and because I did that I got banned in r/JusticeServed.

Of course I would never go in that subreddit anyway, but what if that was a subreddit I loved and constantly participated in?

Would that be fair? No. So something needs to be done.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes. But my whole problem with your comments is that your trying to shift blame to one side. When in reality, in real life, in main stream media, across multiple social media sites, both sides are to blame. 

Yes Reddit has many more leftist sites that have been displaying ABHORRENT and disturbing behavior. This is what I'm trying to draw attention to and fix. 

But i was also responding to your lack of acknowledgement that the right wing extremists are also to blame in many other forms of media. Which I believe to be a result to reddit becoming such a censored, left wing hell hole.

Spin it however you want, but I'm just trying to make you understand that both sides are to blame for this political climate. On Reddit, blame Leftists, I don't care. But don't act like right wingers are the victims, when they've done plenty of damage themselves. 

Anyway, respond however you like, but I will leave the conversation there. It is late. I've made my point. Thanks for the discussion.</div>

    <div class="md">All this “both sides are to blame” when the majority of the media is leftist, and also the majority of the extremist reddits, really is trying to downplay the fact that the problem is prevalent on the left and only appears on the right in a manner reactionary to leftist behavior.</div>

    <div class="md">That’s your opinion and I respect that. I would implore you to continue your search for truth with an open mind and consider that neither side is truly better than the other. I’ve found that once I accepted that, my mind has been opened to many different perspectives, possibilities and potential solutions to today’s major issues.

But I think I’m getting a little too deep for this particular subject.

Anyway, once again I respect your opinion and you are heard brother. Hope you feel this was a productive conversation and with an appreciation that we left it being amicable. Peace out</div>

    <div class="md">I said something similar. I remember because I had a slightly moderate view that I voiced in there and they immediately permabanned me.

    <div class="md">I guess that's true but nothing I said was remotely divisive. I simply called out a post with flawed logic, with no physical proof or convictions to back it up. 

It was just banning me to just only have users in a subreddit that blindly follows whatever narrative the mods deem fit. regardless how true it is or not. On top of that, people get banned from other subreddits preemptively for contributing in other subreddits like r/JoeRogan because ??? i dont know. 

I only care because it's practically censorship and I'm fairly certain they are propaganda generators. I think we all agree propaganda is bad.</div>

I’m tired of people being okay with extremists ruining things for the majority. 

Reddit should have a place where calm, rational minds can discuss difficult topics. We shouldn’t have to resort to a single politically ideology just to speak in a multitude of subreddits. An independent subreddit would be great, but of course that would also get taken over by right or left.</div>

    <div class="md">The only real solution for social media platforms is sane moderation. 

Any site that attempted to spin off from Reddit has been wrecked by nutty conservatives because they all just believe random tabloids. 

But now you’re seeing the catastophic effects woke shitlibs and lefties can have on moderation. 

Until adults are put in charge of moderation, it’s not going to improve.</div>

    <div class="md">100% 

But I also think there is a dishonest, clandestine element here. I realize this sounds a bit cooky and like a conspiracy but my rational mind refuses to believe that some those mods are actual people. Their actions defy logic. So my conspiracy thinks that some social media outlets have infiltrated the mod teams and influenced control narratives.

I’m not saying it’s like this for every mod in every subreddit. But it’s entirely possible and could make sense why a subreddit like Whitepeopletwitter turned into an ultra leftist echo chamber, when at first it was just supposed to be funny tweets</div>

    <div class="md">I will not block you. And although I find it offensive, it does not mean I should immediately silence you. I enjoy listening to others perspectives. 

But what you do not realize is that I have also used that same right of free speech to let you know, that you, in fact, have incorrectly categorized me into a political ideology that I find abhorrent. See how this whole free speech thing works? The thing you claim to defend (but only for yourself)? 

I like free speech. I like new ideas. I like people expressing unique perspectives. Say whatever you want, doesn't mean I lose my right to defend myself from unfair judgement.</div>

    <div class="md">Anyway, this is why I gave my original reply. I saw this coming from a mile away. It's incredibly predictable at this point. Anyone who comes out guns blazing and shitting all over someone they know literally nothing about other than a few paragraphs, could never know all my beliefs and morals. 

It's sad that you already want to hate me. But for that reason, I did not feel like even responding to you. Which is all part of the problem. No one wants to have a real conversation. They just want to shit on someone and call it a day. That's the real tragedy of today's political climate.</div>

    <div class="md">Ironic… that moderator broke rule# 3 by telling you to report another sub-Reddit, and is wrong about the existence of this sub being against rule# 3.

Here’s the rule that the moderator broke:

> **While we allow meta discussions about Reddit, including other subreddits**, your community should not be used to direct, coordinate, or encourage… Mentioning other communities… **with the effect** of inciting targeted harassment or abuse.

Here’s the rule that the moderator is wrong about:

> **While we allow meta discussions about Reddit, including other subreddits**, your community should not be used to direct, coordinate, or encourage… Showboating about being banned or actioned in other communities, **with the intent** to incite a negative reaction.

Notice the clear distinction between Reddit admins use of the word **“effect”** and **”intent”**.

The moderator banning you with an automated bot for participating in another subreddit, then telling you to report that subreddit in your appeal, had the **effect** of you coming here to post a comment (which could have been harassment).

Someone on this subreddit complaining about their unjust ban isn’t necessarily **intended** to make people go to another sub-Reddit. 

An **effect** is a consequence, while **intent** must be proven.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly, my experiences on Reddit interacting with the far left mentality (and I have never voted for a Republican in my life, over like 20 years of voting) is pushing me more toward the 'center' or something. Yeah, the far right is ugly but man, the far left is pretty freaking ugly too.

I know Reddit is just a social media site but for me it's a decent microcosm of social discourse in general -- in which an ascendant radical far left is embracing authoritarianism and censorship as tools against not only its traditional opponents, but more moderate members in the left as well, in a campaign to control the narrative.</div>

    <div class="md">> If anyone's *paid* any attention

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*</div>

    <div class="md">Pretty much, although I wouldn’t vote for Trump regardless. I just don’t like how authoritarian mods have become with censorship and banning people from random subreddits they haven’t participated in yet. 

Everyone just wants to put others entire personality and belief systems in 1 of 2 boxes. It’s obnoxious, unfair, and sets an extremely scary precedent. If you want democracy, maybe don’t ban anyone with a slightly different point of view</div>

    <div class="md">I don’t blame you per se however here on Reddit there is a long history of silencing thoughts that are outside the “ultra liberal” box. 
I personally don’t care what your political persuasion is. Outside brigading and just being nasty I am against silencing people’s thoughts and opinions. 
I sincerely wish that more liberals would have spoken up when people with conservative views were being banned from so many groups. Now that it’s those same moderates and liberals being banned maybe they will develop an appreciation for freedom of expression…even those views you/they wholeheartedly disagree with.</div>

    <div class="md">I hear your frustration.

Unfortunately when everything back then was happening I was a very young man. Young and gullible. 

Now I’m 30, have had many life experiences that have opened my eyes, and started become a lot more curious. I’ve watched/researched a lot of podcasts/movies/videos, read a lot more books, and just become a much more open minded person in general.

Unfortunately now, I realize that people live in a mainstream bubble for their whole lives without ever realizing it. Luckily, I’ve popped that bubble and have grown as a person.

So, I want to clarify that it wasn’t only that I got banned from a couple subs… that was more of a catalyst that resulted in this post. But it’s been a serious concern and frustration of mine for quite some time now. I just haven’t voiced it on Reddit very much, for obvious reasons…

Hope that gives you some insight but also some solace that other people like me hear you, agree with you and are starting to stand up against this egregious censorship of dissenting/divergent thinking.</div>

    <div class="md">The fact that you mention you are a Democrat sums it up in a nut shell.  The communists require total allegiance.  Making that declaration of being a Democrat used to be good enough, but now on reddit you have to prove it.  


Remember the whole Trump thing where he accused any Republicans who disagreed with him of being RINOs?  He was loud about his fascism while the left tries to mask theirs as political correctness. </div>

    <div class="md">You've lost me. I'm sorry that you so badly want me to fit into a little political box, but luckily you don't get to make that distinction for me. Just because I agree with more of the democrat policies than republican, doesn't make me some left wing extremist. If you think that, than this post is for you to realize that YOU are part of the problem. People are not black and white. 

But by all means, use your free speech and try. It doesn't bother me. I'll keep living my life and so will you. And in about 24 hours we'll both forget this meaningless interaction.</div>

    <div class="md">My apologies, it wasn't meant as an attack on you.  My point was that the site is so left leaning that we know saying that we lean liberal provides at least some amount of protection from the censorship.  You inherently realize that you need to make the Democrat disclaimer.  Reddit censors conservative views.


It looks to me like when a person who criticizes a certain country has to make a disclaimer that they are part of a certain ethnic group to try to avoid censorship.  Or a person knows they can only criticize certain laws if they claim a certain gender.


I think your post is dead accurate but I guess I'm accusing the site itself of censorship abuse, not just mods.  I moderate in a couple subs and it is clear to me that the tyranny of the majority is far more powerful here than any mod.  Add to this the fact that we cannot verify that up or down votes on any posy or comment are organic and we have a recipe for propaganda.


Reddit doesn't have to ban your above post because it can simply apply downvotes until it is no longer visible.  If you instead make a post about how you wish there were advertisements on reddit because there are many new products out there that you would love to know more about, you can magically be upvoted.  Yes, I believe the site populates itself.


I was originally going to say 'The fact that you have mention you are a Democrat to avoid censorship...' but I'm tired of seeing things worded that way so I tried clumsily to say it another way.


Sorry for coming off so rude.</div>

    <div class="md">Well god damn, what a well thoughtful and insightful take. Some very interesting points here, especially because you are a mod yourself, in other subs. 

I definitely agree, actually. And admittedly, I did include the democrat part, just so I wouldn’t get immediately downvoted into oblivion (even tho I do lean a bit left).

Yeah, this spoke to me on many levels. Sorry for a misunderstanding, I suppose I had just been fending off some other extremists in this post and it made me a little sensitive to hearing someone say anything about my political beliefs/or telling me what I believe (even tho they are wrong and just want to make negative generalizations).

Thanks for your comment. It was great and I hope it resonates with others as well.</div>

It’s as if you think you have authority how I align politically. Not to be rude, but you just sound like an idiot. Unless you say anything productive towards a real conversation in the next comment, I’m just gonna leave you on read.</div>

Because its weird that you, in a post where you specifically identify yourself as a democrat, comment on a post that isn't to accuse me of "democrat bias".

>It’s as if you think you have authority how I align politically.

WHAT? How did you get that from what I said? I feel like you're arguing with someone you've made up in your head, not me.

&#x200B;

>Edit: yep, that’s what I thought.

Haha, did you take me not responding in 15 minutes to be me running away? You are a very silly person, OP.</div>

    <div class="md">Okay, you think it’s weird. Noted.

I did that because, if you were able to understand the context of the post (which you didn’t, because you let your bias override your rational mind), even though I made sure to say I’m a democratic in the WhitePeopleTwitter comment that got me banned, they still banned me.

There’s no eloquent way of putting that really. The fact is even if you are part of their party, if you have even a slight disagreement… they permaban you. 

Really cool subreddit, considering all the virtual signaling and fake news they obsess about. It’s disgusting, and I’m sorry you don’t see it.

Anyway, you still haven’t addressed the fact that you are clearly an alt account of a mod from one of those shitty subreddits. Which just confirms I was right. You should honestly be embarrassed from this whole conversation. I mean, you’ve continually repeated yourself as if it’s some gotcha, but it doesn’t mean anything. At the end of the day, you’re another cog in the machine. I just hope you realize it one day. Like, how can you just live so dogmatically? Are there no political issues or stories with nuances? I just don’t understand how a person like you exists</div>
