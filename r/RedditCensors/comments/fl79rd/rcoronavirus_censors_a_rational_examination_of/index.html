    <div class="md">That's funny because you'd have to put most world leaders in there as they travel on private jets and use a convoy of SUVs to move around.

It reminds me of how ironic it was that so many world leaders flew to Paris for the climate accords to meet for a few days, driving their SUVs to and from the hotels, and then got on their planes to fly back. A simple multi-day video conference could have solved all of this.</div>

    <div class="md">This article is dead on. The damage of world wide lockdown and blanket social isolation will far outweigh the dangers the virus actually poses to us. 

As of now, we're sacrificing the good of the many for the good of the very few. We shouldn't be quarantining everyone, only those most susceptible to the virus, that is, the oldest and weakest among us. 

This knee jerk reaction of shutting everything down for the sake of what will likely be less than 5% of the human population is going to be catastrophic, if it isn't already. 

It's a hard decision, but better the death of millions of our weakest over the course of the next year or so than the death of hundreds of millions of all kinds over the next decade or more from poverty, starvation, crime, war, and other diseases caused by a severely weakened world economy.</div>
