&gt;Disallowed submissions:

But the major reason this is not the appropriate subreddit comes from the section on our subreddit's purpose:

&gt; /r/WorldNews is for **major world news**

This isn't major world news. It is a story about an event that has no bearing on world politics or events. It's just a story about a woman going to a hospital and getting a transexual nurse. /r/news or /r/nottheonion would be the more appropriate subreddit here.</div>

    <div class="md">Please son. If you're going to argue that the mods do not selectively enforce the rules of that sub you're going to have a bad time. All you have to do is search google for "/r/worldnews censorship" and you get hundreds of screencaps. They do what they want and interpret the rules as they like, which happen to also align with their politics. I don't have a problem with mods shilling for a party or ideology when they're forthright about it. But don't piss on my back and try to tell me it's just rain.

You take screenshots out of context, selectively post lies to subreddits like this, and trash our work. If you think you can do any better, then maybe think about applying to be a moderator? Selective screencaps taken out of context are not indicative of selective enforcement. This becomes especially apparent when you read our rules while looking at the screencaps.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;it's a story about an event that has no bearing on world politics or events.

This is a *major* story in the ongoing changes around the world in attitudes towards people who believe they're anther gender. 

Here's a post about Pakistan criminalizing discrimination against Trans people.  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/6t9kfp/pakistan_set_to_criminalize_discrimination/

Here's one about sex workers, immigrants and trans gender people being rounded up in Greece.
https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1hhrbh/sex_workers_immigrants_and_transgender_being/

Each piece of news there shows that /r/WorldNews certainly believes that trans issues are important. Pakistan is making it illegal to discriminate against them, and Greece is rounding them up. There are many different events going on with this issue.

It is not some insignificant thing that a woman who feels uncomfortable having a man do a procedure that many women would only want a man to do is made to feel like a bigot because of a feeling she and many other women share. We've started moving in to a world where you can't be allowed to feel safe unless the PC police say you're eligible. </div>

    <div class="md">Your argument is unrelated to what I'm trying to tell you. A trans nurse treating someone who requested a woman isn't a change in government policy with a major effect across the world. It's a feature story, which is also against our rules. We allow straight news reports only. So, on top of you posting it to an inappropriate subreddit, we wouldn't allow stories that focus on a single, unimportant event like this. It just isn't world news. It's one event with no global effect. Try /r/politicsuk or /r/news instead. Those subreddits allow feature stories and single, isolated events like this.</div>

The 2nd highest post on /r/worldnews is currently *"New Zealanders build island in bid to avoid alcohol ban"*

Do you think that is consistent with your comment i quoted above? </div>
