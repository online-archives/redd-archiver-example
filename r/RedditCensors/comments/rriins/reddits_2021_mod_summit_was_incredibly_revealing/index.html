      <div class="md">I was going to leave this alone simply because I didn't want to spend the time, but now after seeing they're planning to implement **"true block"** in the ModNews sub https://old.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/rkyoeq/previewing_upcoming_changes_to_blocking/hpgfq0m/ I just can't stay silent. This true block thing is yet another **extremely stupid or extremely corrupt** change. The admins have either been bought out by special interests who want to spread propaganda without being confronted, or they're too stupid to realize that's what's going to happen. And beyond propaganda, it's going to make harassment even worse because the user won't even know that the other person is talking about them. It would also enable bad actors to completely privatize their actions/behavior in ways I don't even want to mention since I don't want to help them do it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The mod summit was incredibly revealing regarding the people at the top behind the scenes. These top admins and powermods they brought on are some of the [unhealthiest](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/dhsvud/there_was_a_recent_post_ranting_that_collapse_is/), stereotypical type of redditor that gets mocked. These aren't people I'd trust to tie my shoe laces, much less run one of the biggest and most important websites in the world.

I'm not going to name names or provide descriptions because I don't want to get in trouble for harassment. 

They wasted the hell out of our time, and just spewed more of the same PR BS.

It's supposed to be live with a chat yet they're playing a pre-recorded video and there is no chat. Didn't even give us a recorded video that we can play on x4 and skip through...

They get a bunch of weirdos to sing songs very badly. This is what we're here for? To listen to this? Do what you want, but why are you making us sit through this?

Steve gets on and says he has a pathological pull towards hard questions, then they give him a bunch of extremely fluff questions, and not a single hard one, such as the one I asked about regarding Spez claiming they were not going to tolerate people manipulating reddit towards one viewpoint, [yet one of the top admins specifically puts corrupt mods in places of power who do exactly that](https://web.archive.org/web/20210917163656/https://old.reddit.com/r/DeclineIntoCensorship/comments/ppid6p/the_reddit_admins_recently_demonstrated_that_they/). 

[Previously I commended Spez for telling the massive amount of people who were demanding heavier, biased censorship to fuck off](https://old.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/pbxl9r/uspez_responds_to_the_we_call_upon_reddit_to_take/haetqpe/), but after the mod summit I think he was just playing good cop bad cop, and/or trying to end the mod rebellion by acquiescing to the power mods' demands while at the same time saying "we're in charge here". I don't believe for a second that he nor any other top admins have a shred of integrity. 

The community manager person that came on first and last was just so fake, spewing more BS. The type of PR person that gets paid to spew fake useless BS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh. It's incredibly frustrating and disheartening to see something with the potential that Reddit had continually fall to new lows. RIP Aaron Swartz. You were a man of intelligence and integrity, fighting for a better world. You are sorely missed. 

&amp;#x200B;

A main problem seems to be that their business model depends on people (mods) being willing to do free work. So you end up with people who are very passionate about a subject, or people who are power hungry/megalomaniacs, and/or people who have nothing going for them and thus have the time to sit around all day on reddit, and/or special interest groups who want to manipulate discussion/content towards their personal goals/ideologies. 

I think you can largely deal with this by making the mod guidelines "rules", and enforcing and expanding them. But the admins seem to have zero intent to do so except in instances where it has some specific benefit for the admins. 

&amp;#x200B;

This latest **"true block"** thing is just taking censorship and echo chambers to the next level. It enables power users who submit a lot of content to basically become mods of a ton of different subs themselves. They can/will now block anyone who says anything they don't like. Very soon there will be zero disagreement on reddit. Any time anyone says anything there will only be people agreeing with them. 

What a fucking shithole this place has become. Appalling. Stunning. Revolting.
