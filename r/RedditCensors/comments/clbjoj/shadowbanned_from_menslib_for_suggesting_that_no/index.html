    <div class="card-body">
      <div class="md">So regarding this post my point is just this:

If you believe that everybody is racist, it follows logically that you are admitting your own racism.

You cannot believe that everybody is "a little racist" without believing you yourself are racist.

**This is not a personal attack, this is a logical consequence.**

So, onto what I said. Initially they removed one comment - okay, maybe I was a bit harsh:

&gt;Wow - did I seriously come to MensLib and read more of this "everybody is racist and prejudice" b.s. rhetoric?

&gt;If you think everybody is racist, they're not, but you obviously are for accepting this nonsense.

&gt;I'm so disgusted and disappointed to see this posted here.

&gt;**No I never thought of "men" as "white men" when reading about men's rights, ever.**

&gt;If you did, you're probably a racist.

&gt;I'm sad to see this here - really disgusting.

I decided to try again with softer words - maybe Automod caught it for something:

&gt;So I replied with a dissenting opinion regarding this post and I was instantly censored.

&gt;I'm sad to see this post on this sub.

&gt;To me, men has never meant white men.

&gt;If that's what you think of when you think of "men", you are the minority.

&gt;Mods - please stop censoring me for disagreeing - and please reinstate my previous comment or explain why it was removed.

That one was removed a bit slower - manually.

I finally just posted:

&gt;Mods are censoring me. Why?

^ That comment never even showed up at all (Shadowban?)

They finally allowed my initially removed comment to be shown with a reply of:

&gt;This post has been removed for violating the following rule(s):

&gt;Be the men’s issues conversation you want to see in the world. Be proactive in forming a productive discussion. Constructive criticism of our community is fine, but if you mainly criticize our approach, feminism, or other people's efforts to solve gender issues, your post/comment will be removed. Posts/comments solely focused on semantics rather than concepts are unproductive and will be removed. Shitposting and low-effort comments and submissions will be removed.

&gt;Attack ideas, not individuals. Friendly debates are welcome, so long as you stick to talking about ideas and not the user. Comments attacking a user, directly or indirectly, are not welcome and will be removed.

&gt;Any questions or concerns regarding moderation must be served through modmail.

Not really clear what rule was violated there - probably because there wasn't one that was violated.

I tried messaging the mods and received no reply.

The original thread is a shitshow of "everybody is racist" rhetoric.

I couldn't believe I saw this on a men's rights subreddit of all places.

They had the gall to suggest that "when people think of men, they usually think of *white* men."

^ No... people *don't* think that - if they do, they're the minority.

Most people aren't racist - most people do not think "men = white men."

It just rubbed me the wrong way.

Anyway, there's my submission on it.

I don't know if I can post any links to anything so I'll just show this:

I think that their membership surged because of that post and now maybe there's a bit of a movement from certain political subreddits there.

    <div class="md">My first post there was asking them what their favorite dildo is lol.  It got no votes or replies, I logged to another account and didn't see the post.  Then in the comments section of another thread I asked if they've ever gotten their testosterone checked and that got me a proper ban.

Long story short, I think they have one of those systems where your replies, but especially threads you start, get a look-over before a mod approves them, and the threshold may depend on your overall karma (to discourage throwaway account posts) - lots of subs do this.

It must be a ton of work for them, but since [92% of far-leftists live with their parents](https://www.wnd.com/2019/06/92-of-leftist-activists-live-with-parents-1-in-3-unemployed/), I guess that gives them enough time to go full Stalin with their censorship / control of their faggy sub.

Edit: Check out r menslibwatch.  Menslib also gets highlighted a lot in r srssucks.  Those links don't work intentionally btw, no need to stir up a ~~hornet's~~ soyboys nest by linking them.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;You cannot believe that everybody is "a little racist" without believing you yourself are racist.

I agree with this premise.

I feel a lot of the people calling others racist are projecting their own opinions on to other people. Opinions they hate having, but carry any way, because objective reality keeps pushing its way through the veil they create for themselves, and it upsets them. 

So, they project it outwardly as an additional defense, and a denial of their own nature.</div>

    <div class="md">This was very interesting to see. 

I disagreed respectfully with that racially charged way of looking at things in [that same thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/cl3z9r/on_whiteness_how_race_and_white_supremacy_affect/), it sparked some interesting good faith conversation that I enjoyed, a few downvotes, and wasn't deleted. However, [only my part of the thread was locked](https://old.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/cl3z9r/on_whiteness_how_race_and_white_supremacy_affect/evtc7up/) by mod u/Mr_Holmes relatively quickly:

&gt; Alright, discussion under this comment has clearly run its course. I'm locking this comment and the comments underneath.

Other discussions there where members agreed were allowed to continue freely. 

This was frustrating because I was in the middle of a reply. It appeared they did not want further discussion about whether it was appropriate and I got the distinct impression that dissent was not welcome there; so I unsubscribed.

Now I'm not sure where to go to read about men's issues from a progressive and open point of view that isn't racially charged, I enjoyed some of the articles that I found via r/menslib but I felt unwelcome after that experience. At very least, it became clear I'm not on the same page as most other members who wish to address men's issues and delegate men's responsibilities by race.</div>

    <div class="md">I can already tell I'm going to be on this sub a lot.

I've dealt with so much censorship since coming here - it's pretty sad how much this site has changed in 6 years.

It's just another way these narratives are controlled and for people that don't spend too much time thinking on these issues, they generally follow the popular opinion assuming it's right.</div>

    <div class="md">I think there's a fine line between maintaining community standards and rules to keep things on topic and outright censorship. The more polarizing the subject matter, the harder this distinction can be. I sympathize with mods because I've been one, and I think shutting down legitimate, relevant, on-topic, good faith discussion is the opposite of what they generally want to accomplish.

This is essentially why reddit has become a series of echo chambers.</div>
