I posted: https://i.redd.it/4ssov0369fm71.jpg "Is Jeff Bezos dr Evil or is dr Evil Jeff" which was being upvoted, as previously removed posts to this sub have been, not that it matters. I've had a lot of posts removed from politicalhumor and presidencialracememes and I suspect it's like select mods who do this based on bias.

Mod replied to the thread with: 

&gt;Removed. Jeff Bezos isn't a politician. 

Same mod that always comments in my posts, has removed them and banned me previously as well as attacked me in multiple threads calling me tankie, dotard and some other names. I've messages mods about this one mods behavior and abuse of power and they have seemingly done nothing about it.

I replied with: 

&gt;He owns one of the largest media outlets that covers politics. Not to mention - How is the topic of billionaires not political? 

They replied with: 

&gt;If you don't understand this by now, then slow down the karma farming until you do. 

&gt;Why aren't you posting about Ted Turner? Because even though he's rich and owns media HE IS NOT A FUCKING POLITICIAN. 

&gt;There are Bezos posts that are political, but "rich guy bad" isn't it. 

&gt;My patience with explaining this to you is exhausted. This is the last one. 

I replied with: 

&gt;And the other posts about him talking about him going to mars etc that are still up, are more appropriate than this? It just eems like you are enforcing the rules arbitrarily (as usual) and have a bit of a grudge againt me because I criticize dems from the left. There is nothing respectable about being authoritarian and pro-censorship, especially if you self identify as a leftist. 

They replied with: 

&gt;Take a breather. 

Then I get this message in my inbox:


&gt;You have been temporarily banned from participating in r/PoliticalHumor. This ban will last for 30 days. You can still view and subscribe to r/PoliticalHumor, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;&gt;You know better than to whine and argue a removal. This isn't your first rodeo.

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/PoliticalHumor by replying to this message.

My god, these neoliberals/fauxgressives and liberal/bluemaga are authoritarian and thirsty af for censorship. I thought they hated Trump for his fascism.. what the fuck would you call tyrannical modmanship/pro-censorship, anti-free press and whistleblower? Come on. The hypocrisy here is astounding.</div>

    <div class="md">Aren't they more Communistic? Or at least in promoting class antagonism. Such as Left, Left like movements as LGBTQ+; TRANS; BLM and ANTIFA(Yes, ironically even the Anti-Fascists) Feminism? I never see a straight pride movement, or white pride movement( They would, and do refer to it as racist. fascist, homophobic, or whatever term they can find to attach that doesn't match the characteristics.)[1 - White Pride movement], or even male and female gender movement. Or even better a ALL movement like a race movement or gender or sexuality movement involving everything pertaining to the subject. 

[1 - Straight Pride Parade

(d)

CNN of the sources is much more toned down compared to the other sources, and in addition to that most of the other sources promote opinions that aggressively denounce the pride parade and go forward to calling it racist, homophobic, fascist, the usual. Ironically even a few call for 'equality' yet some of the believers of the left movement ideology, like source (b) start with the the first line being "The straights are at it again." ]

It's an antagonistic thing(Oppressor and Oppressed). They don't want co-existence, they just want to oppress the 'oppressors'... and also the oppressed but don't tell the useful idiots that( 1 - Straight Pride Parade - review the post at bottom of CNN source).</div>
