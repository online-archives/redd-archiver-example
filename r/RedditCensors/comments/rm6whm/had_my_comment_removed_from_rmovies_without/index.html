Someone wrote:

&gt;Russell Brand is also a fucking lunatic. His YouTube videos are nothing but right wing pandering.

I wrote:

&gt;Why are you smearing Brand?

They wrote:

&gt;because he's a shill to anti vaccers

I replied with: 

&gt;What? No, he isn't. He's anti mandate not anti-vax. Many dem leaders including Biden, Pelosi and Fauci were anti-mandate under the previous administration. Same with the ACLU. Some of the above, along with Kamala, also promoted vaccine hesitency to even saying they would not take the vaccine. Where was the outrage then??? No, I'm not a Trump supporter, I'm a leftist and so is Brand, but the hypocrisy is astounding and when you point it out, you are immediately attacked/smeared as right wing and anti-vaxxer and people try to get you censored.

And that comment was removed.

Another user replied to that comment with:

&gt;Stop simping for anti-vaxxers. These “dem leaders” have never been against vaccine mandates. Try again.

This is the type of comments I got whenever I defended Brand against the daily beast hatchet job https://www.thedailybeast.com/comedian-russell-brand-has-become-a-powerful-voice-for-anti-vaxxers 

This article was spammed in the sub by seemingly anti-Bernie pro-Hillary people. They were not censored, but mods censor those responding to them explaining to them how their smears are actual misinformation.

Two videos that debunk that article:

Breaking Points: https://youtu.be/B-Wok9QW8H8

Secular Talk: https://youtu.be/juGFpAo_7Do

Of course the Humanist Report made a video titled: Is Russell Brand Pulling a Dave Rubin? And David Pakman made a video titled: What Happened to Russell Brand?

And the article (and proceeding videos) was all after Brand made this video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k6X03XvxWw Isn't it curious then when Enough_Sanders_Spam users (Hillary sycophants that project their grift and BlueMAGA/Anon mentality onto leftist) rush to smear Brand?

Edit: Here are dem leaders stoking vaccine hesitancy and being against mandates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcsacdcdyzQ&amp;t and nobody called them anti-vaxxers. These users replying to me think that if you are against mandates or question vaccine effectiveness (even when you have been fully vaxxed) or how it is given, then you must be right-wing and anti-vax. It's absolute bonkers. 

In their minds, if you criticize democrats, then you must be bad faith/grifter/right-wing/Trump supporter. If you criticize Fauci, you are labeled right-wing/Trumper/conspiracy theorist and anti-vaxxer. If you call out Russiagate for the Hillary concocted farce that it is, you are labeled a right-winger/Trumper/conspiracy theorist. The least negative thing they will say to dismiss your points is that you are just a contrarian. The neoliberal faction of the dem party and their dupes on the left, are absolute poison to class solidarity and the pro working class/progressive movement.

Anyways, I had people replying to me with stuff like:

&gt;It's crazy how one small subreddit that doesn't suck Sanders flacid old cock and solely exists to mock his weird cult triggers people sooooo much. Mission accomplished. I knew my username would fucking make you piss your panties. You're just as weird as Trumpers.

And about me:

&gt;Funnily enough, the guy seems to be an exact example of a terminally online Bernie Bro, but with anti-vaxx bullshit thrown in too.

And I'm not asking for those comments to be censored and they weren't. 

&gt;What do you think are the odds that he voted Trump because Sanders didn't win the primaries?


I messaged the mods over the comment removal with:

&gt;I'm curious why my comment was removed here https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/rlhsy8/new_poster_for_death_on_the_nile/hphw7rc/?context=3 it is not misinformation, I provided citation when asked! These users can smear people and engage in personal attacks and be upvoted but the second someone rebukes them and debunked their smears, they are censored? I mean I expected to get downvotes by the echo chamber and or brigaded by people (like those known to brigage out subs like enough sanders spam) who don't vote based on quality of arguments and evidence, but feelings, but I don't expected to be censored for engaging in good faith with these people.

They replied with:

&gt;Jesus Christ, are we debating vaccinations on a film poster now? Let me get the censorship tool.

I wrote back:

&gt;? Do you see all the people saying Brand is an anti-vaxxer? So people responding to that misinformation, should be censored? What is your argument here? My comment was not debating the vaccine, it was stating fact and highlighting hypocrisy. If these other users can bring up the vax over a movie poster, why censor someone who responds to their misinformation and smears with factual information that refutes said misinformation???

They replied with:

&gt;blah blah blah

&gt;When the comment chain gets into slap fights about bullshit unrelated to movies, we cull sometimes because reading through all the comments that led up to one of you telling the other that their mom's a whore or whatever is just depressing. take that tabloid shit to /r/entertainment

I replied back with:

&gt;How is it slap fights? I reply to ad hominems/personal attacks and misinformation with factual information and you censor me. I didn't attack anyone there. You had two users, one from enough_sanders_spam and the other from enoughcommiespam, who were spamming this hit piece by the daily beast and attacking anyone who rebuked the narrative they were pushing and they weren't the only ones taking shots at Brand and other actors/actresses on the poster. Why the fuck would I be punished for giving people correct information and providing citation?

Their response:

&gt;oh god you keep goin, i don't care

I wrote to them this:

&gt;Why are you even a mod then? I come to you in good faith to ask why I was censored, what rule I violated. So a mod gave in to bogus reports and instead of listening to appeals to censorship, you reply with 'omg, I don't care.' What the actual fuck? You mod one of the biggest subs on reddit.

Though they had already sent another message previously:

&gt;that's was a bit rude, sorry. no but you're not banned or anything, we just removed a ton of comments because we're underwater with all the bullshit related to that thread, the 'woke' thread, and the matrix 4 discussion. read through 2 pages of our modqueue comments and you'll have so much brain damage you'll forget math

Their reply to my last message:

&gt;cool

Nice. Very professional. So one of the largest subs on Reddit is modded by people who are childish and authoritarian.</div>
