    <div class="md">Blanket banning people for merely posting on other subs is the epitome of bigotry and antithesis of inclusivity, which is one of the key virtues these people claim to value.

But just like the 2020 race riots, the rules doesn't apply to those who push the agenda of the people who prosecute.</div>

    <div class="md">Don't be daft. It's not about a conspiracy it's about coercion. If people don't want the vaccine who cares? You're vaccinated. You catching it doesn't matter. The only people at risk right right now are those that don't want to get vaccinated. THAT is what "the science and evidence" shows.

I swear it's a fucking meme how many people say "trust the science" and then completely fuck up the conclusion they're supposed to draw from the data.</div>

    <div class="md">No, we most certainly didn't. NNN is overwhelmingly populated by people that simply don't trust the side-effects or dislike being coerced. You seem to paint them as conspiracy theorists. Those people make up a pretty small amount of the population. Additionally, you say "we all need to get vaccinated" which is not true. There's no reason to get vaccinated if you don't believe COVID is a danger to you. There's no benefit for anyone else except the vaccinated individual and whoever pays their medical bills.

Unless you mistyped in your first post which is possible.

&gt; That's what the science shows.

This is still a meme of a sentence.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree. But backing it up with "that's what science shows" is braindead and demonstrates your inability to show how that conclusion is reached. You're also still ignoring the fact that you believe NNN is a conspiracy subreddit and that there's some sort of imperative to get people vaccinated. You don't understand the issue at all. You simply agree with me that for most people vaccination is preferable.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; The only people at risk right right now are those that don't want to get vaccinated.

Except that's not the case. My grandmother is ill and needs to go into the hospital but has to wait 3-4 days to get a room as the place is full of unvaccinated covid patients. There's tons of excess deaths happening all over because hospitals are at their limit. So the anti-vaxxers selfish choices are still hurting others.</div>

    <div class="md">Sorry, I've only been keeping track of places like Texas, Florida, Missouri, you know, the hotspots? They're not full. Never have been. Florida hospital CEOs had to come out and say they were "busy but able" at the height of this most recent surge. I mean, to my knowledge electives are on literally everywhere and hospitalizations are roughly half of what they were this last winter. They didn't get overfilled then how on earth are they going to now with half the population already vaccinated?

So if you are being both truthful and correct about your grandma's case, it's a very isolated situation and not a national pattern. I suspect that isn't the case and you're mistaken. Especially since COVID patients are explicitly segregated from other patients.</div>

    <div class="md">I quit playing PokemonGo when one morning I woke up and my username had changed. I panicked thinking I was hacked and changed all my Google based passwords. Two days after I put in a support ticket to get my name changed back they send me an email saying my name was changed by them, because another player was using it. 

I was a beta player, I got my username before PokemonGo was even released for beta. 

Screw you niantic. The other player was me. I had the same name in ingress. They combined accounts.</div>

    <div class="md">Another option for reviewing removed content is your ***Rev***eddit [user page](https://www.reveddit.com/user/J!e!d!i!S!a!n!g!e?all=true). The [real-time extension](https://www.reveddit.com/add-ons/direct/) alerts you when a moderator removes your content, and the [linker extension](https://www.reveddit.com/add-ons/linker) provides [buttons](https://i.imgur.com/0BAImPq.png) for viewing removed content. There's also a [shortcut for iOS](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/62bc7570613c42cb8b851fad264136df).
