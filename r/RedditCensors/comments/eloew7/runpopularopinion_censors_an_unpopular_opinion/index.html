    <div class="md">My favorite was when I was banned from reddit for a few days because I had the audacity to quote the death threat I was sent (on reddit) to another user. As in, a unhinged redditor sent me a death threat, hoping I would die, my family die, etc., then I quoted it in a DM to another person to show them what I was dealing with. I made it very clear that I was quoting a DM sent to me.

Reddit didn't care.

Same thing on Twitter. They don't give a shit and your petitions are probably just laughed at.</div>

(this is the DM I was sent by a very deranged person, to be very clear I did not write this)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Every day I’m going to wake up from now on and pray you get killed in a  car jacking it mugging or get a terrible slow progressing terminal  cancer you piece of shit alt right incel fuck. Your time in this country  and people like you is fucking over. Soon you will be the minority,  your daughters will marry Hispanics and blacks and white men will end up  where they belong: in the fucking ground and in the history books. You  are a disease. Kill yourself you stupid bitch.

Well you'd be wrong.

A threat includes a statement that an individual will commit a violent act.  This person is an asshat, and clearly racist, but (s)he is not making a threat.</div>

    <div class="md">That's crazy, I expected there to be at least SOMETHING in the post that could be misconstrued as hate, but really there isn't. Its just a benign observation, which the vast majority of replies agree with, that doesn't stereotype or single out a group. Hell, its a verified fact that Asian countries are horribly racist.

Mods shoulda just been like, "Shit's popular, yo. Removing post" like they do with every other opinion they dislike.</div>
