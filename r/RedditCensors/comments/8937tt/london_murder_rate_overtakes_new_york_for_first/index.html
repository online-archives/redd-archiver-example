    <div class="md">But it is true.  Both the  city and state has worked on an agenda to reduce gun violence through gun laws and the result in NYC is that it  now has one of the lowest homicide rates among big cities.  It wasn't just gun laws though.  There was also a lot of progress made by gang units.  It's still quite a success story.</div>
