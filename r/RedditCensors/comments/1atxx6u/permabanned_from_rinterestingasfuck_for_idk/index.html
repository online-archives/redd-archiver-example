It sure as shit isn't to spend the money to help American's.

Also as an FYI on the economy. Growth is up, wages are rising above inflation and production is increasing with the jobs added nearly doubling the expected number in the last report.</div>

Not only is inflation of things like food back into the desired 2-3% range but [wages are above inflation](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/) which means that while prices are still going up (as they always do), there is an effective price cut as people are earning more than the price increase.</div>

    <div class="md">What do you mean there shouldn't have been inflation on food? There's inflation on everything, always. The Fed tries to keep it between 2-3% and it was back to 3.1% annual average in Dec after being as high as 6.4% last year. There are many potential reasons for the inflation, a lot of which stems from the upheaval of Covid which turned supply lines on their heads and had a lot of people hoarding cash as spending dropped. Once everything opened up again, there was a lot of people looking to spend and not enough supply to meet the demand so prices go up. The same is the case or gas prices. It takes time for the market to react to the ramp up in demand for fuel once people started operating normally again. 

The point is that things are improving rapidly. High job creation, higher than inflation wage growth, inflation coming down to the desired level, productivity increasing, low unemployment, stock market climbing...</div>

    <div class="md">[This is all the Republicans doing](https://apnews.com/article/congress-ukraine-border-security-zelenskyy-bf932727abd5e8ff3cf5c9c848a3cf78). It was them that demanded the border bill be included in the Ukraine bill. The Dems said ok and worked with the Senate to get border provisions included that continue construction of the border wall, provide a hard cap of people that can cross with the border shutting down if it breaches that. There was also big funding boosts for the border patrol. The deal was even endorsed by the Border Patrol Council who has been heavily critical of Biden.

Also the bill wasn't killed because of Ukraine funding, it was killed because [Trump told them to kill it](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/05/border-bill-trump-00139584) because he wants something to run on. He is gambling with the border for his own politics but he will need all 3 chambers to get anything passed. If I were Republican, I wouldn't want to be rolling the dice on such an important issue when you have a standing offer that gets you a majority of the way to what you want. The only person this helps is Trump (as with anything he does). For further proof that it isn't Ukraine that is holding up this bill passing, here's a quote from the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/13/senate-republicans-forced-issue-ukraine-aid-now-comes-hard-part/)

>Every Ukraine funding vote in the House has received at least 73 percent support. Ukraine funding opponent Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) reportedly acknowledged Tuesday, “If it were to get to the floor, it would pass; let’s just be frank about that.”</div>

    <div class="md">"Growth is up" because the government spent insane amount of money last quarter and took on massive debt.  


What authoritarianism? The only authoritarianism lately has been from the Democrats.  


Conquest? Putin attacks other countries when Democrats are in office.  


Genocide? Where? You mean when Arabs tried to kill all the Jews?   


Universal healthcare would be a nightmare for a country as large and as unhealthy as the US.  


Social Security is a ponzi scheme and people would be better off if they could invest their own money.  


Wages are not above inflation.  


Jobs have only been up lately because the government has been hiring like crazy. Full time private sector job numbers have decreased like crazy.   


Literally everything you said is wrong. EVERYTHING.</div>

    <div class="md">Take a deep breath my dude.

Growth: Spending went up 0.8% from the 3rd qtr to the 4th qtr so I have no idea where you're getting this "insane amount" of spending from. That aside, the House is controlled by the GOP and they have yet to pass a budget resolution other than continuing resolutions.

Authoratarianism/Conquest/Genocide: The authoritarianism that I'm talking about is Putin's authoritarianism that Republicans are currently deep throating. The latest case and point was Tucker and his fawning tour of Moscow and propaganda interview with Putin. I also don't give a fuck who is on office when Putin decides to invade. What I do care about is Republicans being content to give him everything he needs to succeed, a fractured West. It's abhorrent. The genocide I was talking about was also in reference to Ukraine. The Russian authorities have set up a systemic process of removing Ukrainian children from there homes and taking them to re-education camps to 'Russify' them. Again, this doesn't seem to bother Republicans.

Healthcare: Universal healthcare would not be a nightmare for a country the size of the US and it doesn't have to be a single payer system as proposed by Bernie. All you need is a public option that provides a floor for care. The US is already the highest paying nation per capita on healthcare. Why do you think a system that works for literally the entire developed world wouldn't work for the US?

Social Security: Some people would be better off investing their own money but a lot of people wouldn't. Social Security is a good way of ensuring people aren't left to rot after finishing their working lives. It's a social investment but i'm not particularly hung up on it. There are other ways

Wages are absolutely above inflation. Since the start of 2023, [wages have been outpacing inflation](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/#:~:text=U.S.%20inflation%20rate%20versus%20wage%20growth%202020%2D2024&text=The%20rate%20of%20inflation%20exceeded,wages%20grew%20by%20five%20percent.)

Jobs: [The private sector is doing just fine](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/04/private-payrolls-added-164000-in-december-beating-expectations-adp-says.html). Also it's not surprising that the public sector has taken more time to return to hiring after layoffs during Covid.</div>

    <div class="md">Context:  
  
A video from this sub, r/interestingasfuck, showed up in my feed. It was in German, so idk what he was saying, but it looked like a guy making a Nazi salute and saying something (joking or not, idk) in front of the police and then getting arrested. I said half jokingly "Idk, arresting someone for speech seems like a Nazi thing to do." I quickly got permabanned from this sub I've never interacted with before.

This dude, likely the top Mod on that sub, thinks supporting someone's free speech (which yes, I'm sure is less protected in Germany but I support it anyway) means agreeing with them. They also seem to get off on 'Nazis bad'. Like, of course they are, there's nothing brave or groundbreaking about shouting that you hate Nazis.

Anyway, I think the Mod is stupid, the sub is stupid, and 99% of the time reddit as a whole is stupid, all of them sharing a love of censorship.</div>

You're the same as the Mod... Supporting free speech means supporting others rights to say things, even if you don't agree with them. It's not a hard concept to grasp, even if you don't agree with it.</div>

    <div class="md">US doesn’t have hate speech laws. There are laws against inciting violence, but the bar is really high and the speech has to go beyond simply promoting the idea of violence against a group of people. I can literally legally say “we should go back to gassing the Jews” which is both hate speech and promoting violence, yet it is protected speech.</div>

    <div class="md">Freedom of Speech is in the context of the government, not private bodies ala businesses or people.

Let's try this: Since downvoting lowers viability of a post, if you downvote someone you are violating their freedom of speech via a form of restraint. Similarly, if you report them you are also doing so. You can never downvote or report someone ever again. 

Nore can you ever retaliate for anything anyone says to you, or anyone anyone says about someone you care about. It is their right to verbally harass your loved ones and if you do anything about it you are violating their freedom of speech.

Let's see you stick to your guns.</div>

>I'm not an absolutist, but I think we need more free speech than we have now. The nuances need to be discussed, but espousing hatred, even blind/ignorant hatred, should be protected in my opinion, provided it doesn't cross the lines of threatening violence or targeted harassment.</div>

    <div class="md">There's a difference between saying "We're better off with less \_\_\_ people" or "I'm going to eradicate \_\_\_ people". For a less polarizing example, replace '\_\_\_ people' with 'rapists'. The former is an opinion (in this case, a good one) and the latter is a threat (also, arguably a good one).

As I said in another comment, and I quote:

>I'm not an absolutist, but I think we need more free speech than we have now. The nuances need to be discussed, but espousing hatred, even blind/ignorant hatred, should be protected in my opinion, provided it doesn't cross the lines of threatening violence or targeted harassment.</div>

    <div class="md">The nazi is an idiot.  Getting arrested for being an idiot is idiotic. 

It's like weed related arrests. It's pretty pointless and stupid. Being a dumbass publically should be the only recourse in matters such as these. As the consequence is everyone laughing and berating you. 

You can be anti-nazi and critical of the response. It's called, not being an authoritarian simp.</div>

    <div class="md">Ok now I get it.  You were suggesting it was a nazi thing to silence the speech of an actual nazi sympathizer.  This meant the mod probably figured you were defending nazis in an ironic fashion.

I understand how you weren't functionally doing that but also understand why they would think you were. 

Banning without questioning, investigating or maybe even warning first is just so common on this platform.  They have no time for any of it but a kneejerk and arbitrary judgment.  Its partially the platform's fault in the way these mods are set up.

Yes I'd also blame the culture these days, equating free speech as a dog whistle to say retrograde shit.

Lastly this entire phenomenon reminds me a bit of the prison guard experiment.  Give someone a tiny bit of power.....</div>

Getting banned for trying to actually debate something seems to be a running theme.  not sure how people become mods,  I think it has something to do with getting a free lobotomy.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not an absolutist, but I think free speech is important and we need more than we have now, not less. I don't know the most efficient way to draw the line. Definitely a direct call to violence/harm is a no-no. Harassment is too ambiguous, but obviously you don't want people to be able to target/bombard individuals who are just passing by on the street. A false immediate threat like shouting 'bomb' or 'fire' should be illegal.

There are a lot of nuances that need to be addressed/discussed. However, I don't think 'hate speech' should be forbidden, assuming it doesn't fall into threat/harassment.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly, defending Nazis sounds like a great way to get banned from any community of reasonable people.

And Germany has laws about Nazi shit for a reason. They thoroughly educate their children about what happened and forewarn against any repeat, and part of the prevention is the banning of any and all public displays of Nazism. 

If a sovereign democratic state that was previously the world's most common synonym for evil wants to, as a collective society, make it absolutely clear that this sort of behavior is unacceptable that seems just fine.</div>

    <div class="md">Those are legal consequences enforced by the state, as opposed to social consequences which are typically just retaliatory expressions of free speech by others using the same free speech doctrine.

This isn't fucking hard. It never has been. Free speech doesn't give you the right to say stuff with the guarantee that someone else won't call you a cunt for saying it.</div>

    <div class="md">Fair point, I forgot what was being talked about and read your comment in a vacuum since it sounded a lot like the usual Schroedinger's Freedom talking point, and I missed the context entirely because the other guy made it sound like we were talking about so-called 'cancel culture'.

In this instance, yes, Germany doesn't have free speech when it comes to Nazi stuff. Whether you agree or disagree with it is another topic, but that's a fair and factual observation to make.

Anyway, my bad.</div>
