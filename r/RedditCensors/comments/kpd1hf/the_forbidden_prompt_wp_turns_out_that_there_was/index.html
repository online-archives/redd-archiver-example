&gt;The idea of the prompt is that at first, the protagonist didn't know he was dead, because his afterlife looked so much like his old life, complete with convincing imitations of some of the people he knew. But, bit by bit, he finds that something is not quite right. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's a writer's prompt, something that a writer in a subreddit is invited to use as the premise for a short story. One might imagine one wouldn't see a lot of censorship in a fiction subreddit, because why would there be? None of what is happening in any of these stories is supposed to be real. Yet, so far, this prompt has been removed from r / fantasywriters and r / WritingPrompts. Two subreddits in a row proved willing to censor this prompt.

I've been on a number of sites, some of which were infamous for their censorious mods, but censoring fiction? I've never seen that happen, before, and on Reddit, it is happening repeatedly.</div>

Wow. What a great example of a complete lack of accountability coupled with unlimited power. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Every subreddit turns into an echo chamber punishing the most heterodox positions. As those positions, and who promulgates them, are defenestrated, the bar continues to migrate further upward towards greater and more vehement compliance and leader praise. The party members eat eachother in a series of ever increasingly severe purity tests to prove they aren't disloyal to the party narrative. With each subsequent purge, the crimes that are deemed purge worthy must become more trivial due to economies of scale in the marketplace of outrage. You can't even safely remain consistent with your own position, because no matter how safe and reasonably moderate your position seems in the moment, as the flames of heresy burn upwards, they force everyone away from them to the higher ground of ever more extreme positions. If you remain stationary in your position, yesterday's moderate becomes todays's heterodoxy, and tomorrow's heresy, and you'll burn along with them. This cycle must be broken, culturally wide, or 2021 will be even worse than 2020. It's going to be a rough ride.

&gt;In the case of r / WritingPrompts, I was told
&gt;
&gt;"No prompts referencing real world drama (including politics, recent tragedies)."
&gt;
&gt;so I guess the Black Death must have been recent. Who knew?  🙄 

Did you point that out in a reply? That this could be *any* kind of plague, even a zombie plague, or like *The Stand?* This is really something that should be argued a lot further.

Reddit also needs a kind of "Supreme Court" and a proper appeals process to deal with these situations of power abuse.</div>

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the Middle Ages, when people died from the plague, how many of them died from Covid-19? Nowhere in that prompt did I say anything about Covid. 

If the moderation was based on their decision to read their own meanings into my words, then that was mod abuse.  I'm not going to try to work my way around that. I'm just going to wash my hands of those subreddits.

Thank you for trying to help, but this is a good, hard no. If I have to express myself in some other way in order to not be censored, going so far as to essentially erase my own voice and replace it with yours, then I'm still being censored. One other thing ...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; just because they are trying to get away from the topic as it is depressing. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an excuse for silencing people, "it's depressing" (if anything) manages to be even worse than "it's offensive" in any setting. In a literary one, it becomes absurd. What have people been growing up reading, when they don't realize that real literature does frequently have to include "depressing topics"? That otherwise, it loses the feel of reality, and that's the end of the reader's suspension of disbelief? As a policy, this would amount to a statement that one had better not submit any literature to that literary group. If that is given, then what is left for the group to do?

In a non-literary setting, such a standard goes from being absurd to being positively depraved. To quote one of the characters from "A Wrinkle in Time"

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“There will no longer be so many pleasant things to look at if responsible people do not do something about the unpleasant ones.”

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't read that book for a while, so I can't remember which character said that, but it's a valid point, regardless. The genuinely frightening thing is that in conversations with full grown adults, I find myself given ample cause to cite valid points from children's books. This is not indicative of an ability on the part of said alleged adults to function as adults. If we can not talk about unpleasant things, then we can not deal with unpleasant things, and society ends up disintegrating.

But really, it stays depraved, even in a literary setting. Literature holds a mirror up to life, or at least, it's supposed to. It forces the reader to see things that he's overlooked, because those things would take him outside of his comfort one. A story that can not upset anybody is a story that has nothing to say, and is not worth reading. Could I fit in better with a group of overgrown children by writing such stories? Perhaps so, but if I certainly wouldn't be growing as an author by doing so, and I would have to be at least a little worried about my own frame of mind, at that point.

Not that I don't love children, but by the time I get toward the end of grad school, I think the time has come for me to stop being one of them, myself. As it has for the people setting policies like that one.</div>

Really, it doesn't. Again, a plague doesn't have to be Covid-19. If it did, Medieval history would look a lot different, and Native Americans would be a lot less scarce.

&amp;#x200B;

Except that I really shouldn't have to do any such thing. First of all, because I didn't mention Covid in the prompt. This is not open to debate. It's simply an objective fact.

Secondly, because the standard of literary propriety that you propose is one that would have been considered extreme and insane even by the standards of the old Eastern bloc.  Even during the worst days of communist rule, Ijon Tichy could go wherever he wanted in the Universe, even if, as one read between the lines, one might have suspected that Stanisław Lem was not entirely pro-Soviet or pro-Warsaw Pact.

When the mods are literally being more censorious than Stalin or any of his puppets, they're going too far. No, I should not have to reword my writer's prompt to avoid the danger of somebody believing that I had engaged in wrongthink on the subject of Covid. That's ridiculous.

Aside from the objective fact that you're reading things into the prompt that aren't there, one has the whole horrible idea of an attempt to enforce a politically motivated orthodoxy on a scientific question. Again, while some would compare this idea to something Soviet, I would have to push back against that, at least a little. Post-Stalin, Lysenko got abandoned, so in fact, your position would have been considered too totalitarian for the Soviet Union, from the time of Khrushchev onwards. In this case, what the Russians would have rejected, even before freedom found its way into Russia, wouldn't have even been the idea of reacting severely to the perception of a literary allusion to dissent in scientific matters, but that of doing so in response to direct, openly expressed dissent, done in no uncertain terms.

When you're literally going too far for a hard liner like Andropov, and still claim to be anti-censorship, I have to wonder who you think you're fooling. As the saying goes, freedom isn't free. If we're not willing to risk bruising a few feelings to keep it alive, do we really deserve it?

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that unlike some, I live in a country where people like the ones running those subreddits usually don't have much power. I intend to do my own small part to help preserve that desirable state of affairs, by refusing to cooperate with those who, given the chance, would nudge America in the direction of becoming something worse than anything ever seen in Eastern Europe.

If people were able to dodge machine gun fire to get to freedom, I think I can manage to post my prompts and stories in a place that isn't trying to help take freedom down with a death of a thousand cuts. If I couldn't bring myself to do at least that, how would I ever dare to face some of my neighbors and family elders?</div>

Dude, are you serious? It doesn't take a PHD student to read into your prompt to figure out it is about covid. You are fooling yourself. Out of all circumstances to choose when to act like a victim and you choose this one? Writing paragraphs on paragraphs about censorship in the Soviet bloc just because of a mediocre story prompt that was deleted?

Get over yourself. You are more so a victim of your own bad taste than censorship.</div>

&gt;  
&gt;Dude, are you serious?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. The question I put to u/girlwithswords could be asked here, as well: "Back in the Middle Ages, when people died from the plague, how many of them died from Covid-19?" The answer to that question, of course, is "none."

Despite your willful ignorance to the contrary, there most certainly were (and still are) plagues that are not Covid-19.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It doesn't take a PHD student to read into your prompt to figure out it is about covid.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, you're supporting censorship based on what you believe to be your ability to read minds, and psychically know that I dissented from the official party line on Covid? There are so many different layers of wrongness in that, but I've already addressed those subjects.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You are fooling yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know the meaning of my own words, so you're going to explain them to me? Fascinating. Nothing totalitarian about that, at all.   🙄

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Out of all circumstances to choose when to act like a victim and you choose this one?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, this one. Censorship matters. If we're at the point at which one literally isn't free to write a piece of fiction if it is perceived as hinting at something that goes against the party line, then how much freedom is really left? If I'm not going to push back, now, when would I push back? What tiny scrap of freedom am I allowed to stand up and fight for?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Writing paragraphs on paragraphs

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering how long the whining about tl;dr would take to make an appearance. Your limited attention span is your problem to deal with.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;about censorship in the Soviet bloc just because of a mediocre story prompt that was deleted?

&amp;#x200B;

So "mediocre" that you were left feeling personally threatened by it? There was nothing subtle about the hysteria in your comments.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Get over yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

You say, as you put your sense of entitlement on display.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You are more so a victim of your own bad taste than censorship.

&amp;#x200B;

"Bad taste"? Is that what political incorrectness is being called these days? How very entitled of you.

This is where I block you, because you're acting like an abusive lunatic. Not that this is unusual on Reddit, but it adds nothing to my day. No, you are not being censored by this, to respond to your next pre-scripted point. You're free to go on ranting and raving like a maniac, because you just know (damn it, know!) that I posted that story prompt as an expression of dissent with something you believed, and others will be free to listen to your nonsense, if they wish. I just won't be one of them.

See the difference between what I'm doing and what those mods did? No? Well, that's your problem.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;I don't mean to bother you,

&amp;#x200B;

Not a bother, at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  but I have some questions about your fiction, like what if the character doesn't believe they died?  

&amp;#x200B;

That's part of the idea of the prompt - at first, the character thinks he's still alive. He thinks he has survived the incident that killed him, because his surroundings down in the underworld have been molded to exactly resemble the place he was in when he died. His transition between life and death was unpleasant, but seamless.

Thus the horror he experiences in the illusion of his continuing life as he watches a plague sweep over what he thinks is the world. If he knew he was dead, how much could he fear his death, or the deaths of those he cared about? His friends and loved ones either aren't there at all, or, if they are there, are as dead as he is, and so not really at risk.

I pictured his tormenters torturing him psychologically, at least at first, instead of throwing him into a flaming pit and prodding him with pitchforks, because they could get him to experience more misery that way. A real living man in a real flaming pit could not truly rise above the pain, because the pain would represent something real: the destruction of flesh that he could not replace. But a disembodied soul can experience nothing but sensations, sensations that are nothing more than illusions, because it has no body to be touched by the environment it senses. It can aspire to a truly stoic detachment from suffering, because there is nothing really at stake for it, any more. Illusions can be ignored. The spirits troubling him know this, and worry about it, because if in spirit he detaches from their torments, they will lose their power over him.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; another question, if they lived their life trying to improve the world,  if they still found them self in said world, would they not continue   such? 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose he (or she) would. A seamless transition to a new life would have no reason to be a transformative one. Or would it?

As far as the character is concerned, relatively little has happened. He thinks (at first) that he has escaped a narrow brush with death. This is cause for relief, maybe for rethinking some of one's bad choices in life, But unless the brush with death was one that hinted at betrayal, why would it inspire cruelty in a kind man?

Unless he wasn't really kind, at all. The question is, why is he in Hell? Perhaps at his core he is a dreadful person who deserves no better than what he is now experiencing, somebody who merely pretended to more decent than he really was in order to win the approval and support of others, one who was emboldened by his imagined good fortune and came to feel invincible. Or perhaps he is a genuinely good man who has the bad fortune to live in an unjust universe under the rule of a cruel god?

I have to leave at least a little vagueness, if not more, because a writer's prompt isn't a story, it's an invitation to write a story. I have to leave some things up to the person responding, give them some choices to make.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;  I have heard of many beliefs relating the world as an illusion or  merely a "test" and I believe it is worthwhile to always test ones  reality, 

&amp;#x200B;

Maya, in Hinduism? If I remember that word correctly? I suppose that one could assume that the world the protagonist left behind worked that way.

Another of the unsettled questions left by the prompt is whether or not there is hope to be found in Hell. Can one escape it through spiritual growth, or is it a very Western, punitive sort of Hell that exists only for the sake of retribution, not for the sake of any sort of reform or rehabilitation of the soul?

If our protagonist sees through the illusion of his pain, should he find himself in that hypothetical flaming pit, will he gain any sort of real freedom, or will his memories be wiped away, leaving him to be freshly tortured anew?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; slipping in and out of different phases interests me. 

&amp;#x200B;

You could certainly write a story about that.</div>
