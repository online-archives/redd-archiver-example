https://snew.notabug.io/r/worldnews/comments/b2vi76/telstra_blocks_access_to_4chan_8chan_liveleak_in/

With over 11,000 comments, ceddit took almost ten minutes to load the page. Here's the removeddit if that's helpful:

Here's some comments the mods at /r/WorldNews didn't want you to see:


&gt;It's gonna take the establishment a few shootings by death-penalty-for-apostacy-phobic whites (Islamist terrorism is just "part and parcel of living in a big city" so no big censorship push needed afterwards) to get to banning encryption it seems. I'm sure Anons are already migrating to tech like IPFS to prep for something stronger than a DNS block given how censorship happy the West now is.

_

&gt;I am for Facebook being censored, Censored out of existence, the China way.  

Guess we're not allowed to talk bad about China now. Wonder if that order came down from the shit for brains admins right in to the waiting mouths of the /r/WorldNews power mods. 

&gt;fuck anyone who censors anything. This is a bigger terrorist attack than the actual shooting  

The fact that the above comment was censored is some of the most palpable irony I've found in a while. 

&gt;I’m on Optus, can still access /b. Phew

How does the above comment break any rules?

&gt;This post will be removed soon

_

&gt;Disgusting fascist censorship.

_

&gt;4chan had nothing to do with it. Why was it censored?

_

&gt;In other news, censorship, censorship, and MORE censorship!

_

&gt;NZ are doing exactly what the shooter predicted they would over extend and over react. This is just going to redpill more normies on what happens when you love in a socialist country. Gg liberals, youre your own worst enemy.

Sorry for anything poorly formatted. I do all of my Reddit through mobile so this is all done on my phone swapping between tabs. </div>

    <div class="md">Did a quick search through a 4chan archive and found this for those interested. Multiple providers blocking access, it seems: 
  
&gt; Twenty hours ago, Telstra also began pulling down sites for general Australian access. These now include several Chan-forums, Live-Leak, and 0 Hedge. Vodafone and Optus are two other major providers that have since restricted access to these sites as well. At this time, iiNet has not restricted consumer access to websites.
