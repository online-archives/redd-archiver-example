    <div class="md">My meds allow me to function. It doesn't make me an "amphetamine zombie." It makes me not only able to do things, but it makes me *want* to do things.

Quite frankly, you should change your attitude towards ADHD meds. My dad was like you at first, only he tried to enforce his aversion to meds onto me. And if it wasn't for my mom pushing for me to get meds, I'm telling you right now I'd either be in jail, homeless, or dead.

And if the wrong person sees someone like you talk about how meds make *you* feel, they may be deterred from trying them, and that's dangerous. I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you've tried them and just couldn't stand the side effects, but that's not the case for everyone, and for those people, their lives could potentially be improved beyond their wildest dreams.

Meds aren't for everyone. That doesn't mean they're *not for anyone*.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;Quite frankly, you should change your attitude towards ADHD meds.

No, I never will. And you're right, I have plenty of experience with the meds and am wholly opposed to their effects. I had them forced on me as a kid my entire time in school and they quite literally made me a zombie. I hate the meds and I think they're a crutch. After I was old enough to make my own decisions I ditched them and never looked back. My life is so much better having learned how to cope with ADHD through corrective behavior rather than with amphetamines. 

&gt;And if the wrong person sees someone like you talk about how meds make you feel, they may be deterred from trying them, and that's dangerous.

I'm not responsible for the decisions somebody else makes. That's the argument used against freedom of speech and you should know better given the sub you're in right now.

I understand for some people my way of living with ADHD isn't an option but most of what I read in that sub is just people finding any excuse to apply victimhood to themselves to then build an entire identity around that victimhood. It's a lifestyle of self-defeat and that's much more destructive than any of my opinions could ever be.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;No, I never will.

Let me be more specific.

You should more carefully word your opinion regarding ADHD meds, because what you're saying comes across as you asserting that *your* *experiences* are *universal truths*.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I hate the meds and I think they're a crutch. 

See, they may have *felt* like a crutch *to you*. But to *me*? They're less of a crutch and more of a prosthetic leg - I can't walk without it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I'm not responsible for the decisions somebody else makes. 

If someone makes a poor decision because you have misinformed or mislead them (be it intentional or not), then you are at least *partly* responsible. People are ignorant, gullible, and don't necessarily know *how* to think, so those of us who are informed about a particular topic ought to do our best to avoid spreading misinformation and misconceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; I understand for some people my way of living with ADHD isn't an option but most of what I read in that sub is just people finding any excuse to apply victimhood to themselves to then build an entire identity around that victimhood. 

Yeah, you're right, unfortunately. I mean, ADHD is a bitch, and it DOES impair certain things (namely my short-term memory), but I can't stand it when people use ADHD as a reason for why they "can't" do something.</div>

    <div class="md">How long have you been medicated? ADHD meds do turn you into a zombie after the comedown. Especially when you have been taking them for a good while and build a tolerance. What essentially happens is your stimulated brain becomes the baseline and your old baseline feels exhausting in comparison. This is the case with all stimulants.

The meds do not "fix" your ADHD. They boost your brains dopamine release artificially so you can function on the same level as a normal individual. But your brain only makes a finite amount of dopamine and once you run out, or once the meds wear off and your brain experiences a shortage, you feel worse than you normally would have. Eventually you need to increase the dosage for the same effects and it becomes a roller coaster of highs and lows.</div>

&gt; ADHD meds do turn you into a zombie after the comedown. Especially when you have been taking them for a good while and build a tolerance. 

Not me they don't. I've been on the same dose (which is admittedly high, but I'm a very large man, so) for well over half a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The meds do not "fix" your ADHD. 

Well of course. They don't cure ADHD anymore than insulin cures diabetes.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The meds do not "fix" your ADHD. They boost your brains dopamine release artificially so you can function on the same level as a normal individual. 

Not quite. The meds *reduce* the rate at which dopamine enters presynaptic neurons. It doesn't actually affect the *production*.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Eventually you need to increase the dosage for the same effects and it becomes a roller coaster of highs and lows. 

Like I said, same dosage for at least 5 years.</div>

If you look at the *entire* thread

*this is exactly my fucking point*. Or, more precisely, "respect the fact that your own experience is *your own experience* and therefore *not* reflective of what someone else will experience." Just because meds *don't* work for *you* doesn't mean that *everyone* should *outright dismiss them.*</div>

    <div class="md">You mean people with an actually diagnosed ailment? No.

However, years ago, and i mean.. 10+ or so, on places like Fark.com I watched as a lot of social posts suddenly started to shift towards how much medicine people took, how they needed medicine, how they self-diagnosed, how meds gave them an excuse for failures and a reasons to have a conversation. 

Those are the people I am talking about.</div>

    <div class="md">none of those are scientific, they're just sensationalist opinion articles.  the kind of literature one reads to back up their own opinion.

oh and edit, they have zero to do with adhd. Adhd is a more common diagnosis now, that simply means we are learning more about it and are more aware of it.</div>

    <div class="md">Looks like I hit a nerve on someone who is medicated for whatever reason. I hope you get help if you need it. If you legit need meds, I hope you get them, and eventually you can get off them because you're doing well.

Again, there are a lot of people out there using and abusing pills just because it gives them an excuse, it gives them a reason, it gives them a talking point etc.. those are the people I am talking about. My links use survey data and prescription data, actual facts are listed. It fits. People are using drugs more so today than before.. that's not healthy and we need to address that, and then fix it. "hey I need ADD meds for my self-diagnosed ADD" "hey, I need depression meds because I don't have friends, because I have depression, because I am an uninteresting person, so I have depression".. etc..those people

Good day, and good bye.</div>

    <div class="md">that's not how meds for adhd work lol. it's a lifelong condition that will never go away when you're "doing better". just your intense misunderstanding of the disorder is bad enough that you should keep your med shaming opinions to yourself, otherwise you should really consider getting educated. people like you are harmful to others who need treatment but have been misled.

you didn't hit a nerve with me, I'm just blown away at the ignorance. I tend to not really talk about or have strong opinions about things I'm ignorant of, helps avoid sounding like an uneducated ass.</div>
