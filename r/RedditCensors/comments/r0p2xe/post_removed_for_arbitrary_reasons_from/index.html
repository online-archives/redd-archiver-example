I messaged them:

&gt;My post here was removed as a repost https://np.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/qw2avj/murdered_by_chong/, yet I did not see that it had been posted here before so that is my mistake if it had been, could you please link me to the original post?

I received:

&gt;It's a common repost we've seen numerous times. Regardless, the post violates our rule on No Politics, as Bernie Sanders is a political figure

I replied:

&gt;&gt;It's a common repost we've seen numerous times.

&gt;I think that was just the initial Elon replies to Bernie tweet post, no?

&gt;&gt;Regardless, the post violates our rule on No Politics, as Bernie Sanders is a political figure

&gt;But the post is about Elon getting owned by Chong?

I also replied to "It's a common repost we've seen numerous times. Regardless, the post violates our rule on No Politics, as Bernie Sanders is a political figure" with:

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/i5vfo7/bernie_sanders_reply_to_elon_musk

&gt;Yet this post ^ is still up and I'm sure I could find more. What is up with the inconsistency in removing 'political' posts?

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/exl8xr/murdered_for_comparing_bernie_sanders_to_george

&gt;Here are more posts including or about bernie that are still up and there are more than these. What gives?

Like 2 days later they responded with:

&gt;Hi, many of the links you posted were grandfathered in before the rule was set in place. We usually only list one reason when a post is removed, though sometimes entries can break multiple rules. Your post was both political in nature (mentioning a current or former US congressman) as well as being a common repost.

&gt;Hope this clears things up.

I replied with:

&gt;Hi, this post is on Bernie, Elon replying to Bernie -

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/qtwsdw/elon_can_be_so_forgetful_sometimes/

Notice the above post is recent, not months ago.

&gt;My post is Tommy Chong dunking on Elon, it is not a repost of that ^ post and how is the above post any less political than my post? Just a genuine question.

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/qw2avj/murdered_by_chong/

The mod/s replied to that with:

&gt;As long as there is no direct reference to a current or former serving US politician the post can be approved on a case by case basis.

I typed:

&gt;...

I never heard back from them and my post was not reinstated/approved.

I posted to the r/Coronavirus sub and it was removed, I believe it was initially flaired as misinformation.

I got this response after inquiring about my removed post:

&gt;Your submission has been removed because

&gt;You should contribute only high-quality information. We require that users submit reliable, fact-based information to the subreddit and provide an English translation for an article in the comments if necessary. (More Information)

&gt;If you believe we made a mistake, please message the moderators. was removed due to 'low quality'

I replied to that message with:

&gt;Which is what Dr. John Campbell provided here.

I first messaged the mods:

&gt;Just looking to see if I can get my post here approved https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/qrv9yh/new_pfizer_drug_and_ivermectin or if not, can you please tell me how it violates the rules and is not relevant to this sub?

They replied with:

&gt;We don’t allow YouTube links unless from a governmental agency or a reputable news source.

I replied with:

&gt;Dr. John Campbell is a reputable source on covid, as he always sites reputable new sources and information over Covid-19 out the government.

Including peer reviewed studies!

I also wrote:

&gt;Just curious but why is that? Is the sub captured or working for MSM or the govt or any political party? I guess I just don't understand not accepting covid news links from doctors who are reputable and who cite these sources you allow, just because they themselves are not the source.

Mods replied with:

&gt;We used to allow links from Dr. John Campbell but unfortunately he has had some videos entertaining misinformation, so we no longer allow him as we do not have the time to watch all of his videos and make sure they are accurate.

As if they weren't censoring people and or posts like this back at the start of the pandemic. I could have sworn I posting a video from Dr. Mike Hansen and it being removed. I also remember being censored over pointing out hypocrisy over the non politics rule, I could not point out how Cuomo was being propped up at the sub and a number of fluff pieces upvoted through the roof but mods would censor criticism of that or any talk about the nursing home handling. I also remember being censored over posting studies that suggested that the virus may end up sticking with us like the flu.

I replied with:

&gt;I see, I didn't see any misinformation in the video I posted so I'm curious what videos of his are misinformation.

I reiterated that I posted "reliable, fact-based information" and the post was now flaired 'low quality.'

I wrote:

&gt;Do you allow medical misinformation out governmental agencies and or 'reputable news sources' MSM, like them saying someone is taking horse paste, like Joe Rogan? How about when they cover Biden lying over Covid or when Fauci lied over Covid? This is documented, it is not a right or left wing position. Just curious if you have double standards here regarding the spread of medical misinformation. If so, why?

Did a quick search and replied again with:

&gt;So you allow MSM to push medical misinformation https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/pgd78x/joe_rogan_says_he_has_covid_took_widely. But doctors who highlight medical misinformation pushed by MSM or drugs being politicized or vaccines administered incorrectly, is misinformation and problematic? Your sub is corrupt.

Their reply:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/Coronavirus. You can still view and subscribe to r/Coronavirus, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;Note from the moderators:

&gt;&gt;troll

I was immediately muted so I could not defend that accusation.

4 (?) days later, I replied to this troll accusation:

&gt;I'm not a troll. You claimed John Campbell isn't allowed because he 'entertains misinformation' yet could not point to me where he was pushing medical misinformation. I on the other hand, could point to posts in your own subreddit by MSM (what you consider trusted sources) pushing medical misinformation. So censorship and mod abuse aside (you muted me instead of answering my appeal over inconsistency in rule enforcement) you know you are incredible hypocrites, yes?

No reply, just muted for 28 days. 

I had posts removed from curiousvideos and when I messaged the mods, they replied with: 

&gt;Downvoted and reported by the community to be low quality content.

Despite both posts being equal or better quality than what I saw up on the front of the sub (one was from the history channel) and I saw other posts that were downvoted and at 0 that weren't removed. I also informed the mod/s that I have users who follow me and dowvote and report my content to get it removed, but heard nothing back and neither post was reinstated. At least two examples of this here is users who helped me get banned from politicalvideo, coming to this sub and replying to my posts about censorship in politicalhumor, politicalvideos and politicalrevolution.

I also had more posts removed from Political_Revolution (at least 3 this week) and heard nothing back when messaging the mods:

&gt;Can I ask why my post here was flaired as misinformation and removed? It is not misinformation. This is not the first time this has happened here either. What is going on??

https://np.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/opz4ei/political_revolution_still_removing_posts_for/

I posted to WhitePeopleTwitter and had my post removed. Messaged the mods:

&gt;I'm writing to you to figure out why my post here was removed https://np.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/qw6ijj/can_someone_agree/

Never heard back. Very common occurrence. 

I also had posts removed from a few other subs and mods said either 1) didn't respond (like movies, videos, music, gaming) 2) it was caught up in their spam filter or 3) it wasn't their doing (that perhaps I was shadowbanned or had a hidden reputation (?) I waited more time in between posts and this mod made me an approved user and still they had to manually approve my post. Thank you Retrowave, Overwatch, Spectart, alltheleft and DemocraticSocialism mods for reinstating/approving my posts. A normal week on Reddit these days, at least for some people.

I think users reporting people and their content just to get it removed (be they spiteful or on the job), love when automod and mods support their agenda and I think admins don't mind (if they don't also participate - looking at you PRM, Chapo, NoNewNormal) as it no doubt suits their neolib/neocon agenda. **I don't think this place is any less** astroturfed, manipulated (including propaganda (and disinformation) - manufacturing consent and gaslighting (including smear campaigns), co-opting subs (just as leftist progressive movements have been co-opted by the liberal establishment and or state actors/the govt), censorship and efforts to suppress healthy discourse and to control the narrative and of course automod abuse w/algorithms) and captured by politicians (also corporations and big pharma), the security state and military industrial complex (Reddit's director of policy worked for the Atlantic Council) **than Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube or Wikipedia.** Just want to cover all the bases here.</div>
