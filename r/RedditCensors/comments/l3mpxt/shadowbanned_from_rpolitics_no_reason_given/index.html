    <div class="md">That’s not how shadowban works. Shadowban is that you can comment. However, other people won’t see your comments, and you be left wondering why you don’t have replies or at least people upvoting/downvoting you.

So either you were banned from that subreddit, in which case you would have received something telling you that you were, or Reddit just wasn’t working.</div>

    <div class="md">No. The blm protests are because black people are being killed more often and getting harsher jail sentences than white people in the same place. The blm protests were peaceful 93% of the time you can look that up.

The Capitol terrorists set up a hanging station and had zip ties. Messages of people there show they planned to do harm to members of congress. They were planning violence. They beat cops to death with american flags.

Those were white supremacists terrorist who's stormed the Capitol.

Blm are Americans who want to be treated like humans</div>

    <div class="md">I have formed my own opinions from knowledge and experience. I encourage you to do the same. 

10,000 people at the capitol that day, and you want to paint them all as “terrorists” because a few individuals claim to have been plotting violence, while dismissing that dozens of people died over the summer and hundreds of millions of dollars of damage was done because of the _ideology_ behind those crimes? If one is terrorism, so is the other, no matter why. It’s simple logic.  

I just cited you firsthand examples of how the shoe fits the other foot and you dismiss it because of your cognitive bias. 

You fail to see where this leads. People should be allowed to disagree but violence should be stopped immediately, it can’t be allowed for one side but not for another, or the situation will only escalate. It can’t be prosecuted on one side but not for another, or it will lead to one-sided authoritarianism. See: USSR</div>

    <div class="md">That’s a fair point - I would disagree that attending a protest and then being literally allowed into the capitol amounts to terrorism. This wasn’t a planned and organized attack on democracy - it was a peaceful protest that was agitated by outside actors and got out of control. It was not by design. 

The capitol police opened the barricade and allowed them to approach the building _knowing_ they didn’t have backup, because the crowd was pushing forward and people in the front were going to be hurt. Things got out of hand. 

Just like the BLM protests/riots (there have been both). The difference is the way the news propagandizes things, but if you remove the political lens, it’s the same thing under the surface. Look deeper.</div>

    <div class="md">That's actually why I don't watch any main stream media and try to get the view from people I disagree with.

I don't watch CNN or fox or whatever else. They are all biased. I try to find the least biased sources then compare what they are all saying

And why did the police let them in? Let's look at that. Did some allow it out of fear? Probably but did some allow it because they secretly wished they could be storming in and doing harm? Definitely

And this "peaceful protest" at the Capitol was because people disagreed with a Fair Election. A fair election which has no widespread evidence of voter fraud.
Again blm is because they want to be treated like humans</div>

    <div class="md">Let me ask you this: if there is specific evidence of voter fraud, is it invalidated because it’s not “widespread”?

The election being potentially hacked in 2016 was worth impeaching the sitting president to many politicians. Then that was finally dismissed because in 2 years literally 0 evidence was presented, they got their day in court though. Now with this election, when we had massive mail-in voting and there WERE anomalies (like 350k+ vote spike at 4am in multiple swing states simultaneously), suddenly, questioning the election and wanting due diligence and transparency makes you a conspiracy theorist and a terrorist?  As Biden would say: come on, man.

We should be addressing the failures to respond to this pandemic and the concerns people legitimately have about the election, and come up with a plan to ensure this never reoccurs. 

What happened in 2016 with the impeachment and now in 2020 with the mail-in ballot dump is *not normal*. 

How is it OK that the people designing voting software systems have direct connections to some of the most powerful politicians in the country?</div>

    <div class="md">There has been no evidence is elections past that mail in voting is any more prone to fraud
Trump had like 70 days in court with all of the lawsuits they tried.
It was dismissed in higher courts before reaching them because there was no evidence. Trump's own intelligence said as much. 
4am counting has been explained. The massive spikes were because there were delays on mail because so many more people voted from home cause or covid. 

Wanting due diligence and questioning is does not make you a terrorist. But after everyone said there was none, storming the Capitol is not the solution. That does make you a terrorist</div>

    <div class="md">I’m not ok with mail-in ballots that were received after Election Day being counted - it’s 100% unconstitutional. That alone was a strong enough case that SCOTUS should have heard it. 

There has never been mail-in ballots on this scale in those specific swing states, you realize that, right? Look at Florida - they have done lots of mail-in votes for years and they were one of the first states to certify their results. There is no excuse for multiple stops and starts, witnesses and observers being forced to leave, or ballots being brought in from external places late at night.

I think there is compelling evidence to warrant an investigation, but no one in power seems interested in it. I wonder why? 

They seem interested in scapegoating the people who did blunder at the Capitol to silence people who do want to know more and have this all looked at in-depth. I wonder why?</div>

    <div class="md">People have the right to protest WHATEVER THEY WANT. That’s the point. It’s free speech and the right to assembly. Those are critical for a democracy to function. However, there is no disputing that at _least_ 90% of the people were there simply to protest and assemble peacefully. 

I don’t know why the police let the people in. Shouldn’t we be asking that question to the people accountable for the police’s actions on that day? Where is the anti-cop outrage??

Apparently, a witch hunt for the people dumb/unlucky enough to wander into the Capitol building is the answer, not accountability for the failure to secure the property. 

What’s the excuse for the difference in force response to the BLM protests and the Trump protests? IMO there isn’t one.</div>
