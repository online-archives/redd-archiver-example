Yesterday there was a rather well received post on /r/all originating from /r/food

https://www.ceddit.com/r/food/comments/6egxmv/_

At first some posts began appearing as deleted, as shown above, all but one of the posts meet posting standards, a few of which raise good points and were well received such as one raising a question of food safety in sushi.

Then the post it self disappeared from view. 
I messaged the user who posted it asking why it was removed to which he responded that he didn't even realise it was removed, nor was he given a explanation from the mods.

On my mobile view I was unable to message the mods so I hit 'Report' knowing that the reports show up under the post anyway. Simply writing 

&gt;Please add a post explaining why the post was removed

This is what I got in response:

https://i.imgur.com/2NOyAtCh.jpg

Didn't even realise it was a rule. Or that the anonymous reporting system could be traced back, or that you could be banned for using the report button ONCE in the two years I've had the account for.

Edit: Well that's some wonderful formatting in the mobile website for a unrelated image...</div>

    <div class="md">As was my impression.

I'm assuming admins can see the username. Moderators just see a sequential number with the report.vSo either they reported the report to a admin or there's a admin doing moderating amongst the food team.

Though seems like a rather petty thing to suspend an account site wide that has otherwise not had any infractions over. a warning or temp mute in food would have sufficed.</div>

    <div class="md">Ah, I had a comment on that post silently *"shadow removed"* for some reason.

 Made no sense at all except I know they have a few power-happy mods on their mod team. Reddit is really starting to suck, even more than the fucking Pao era. Even more than during Spezgiving.

For those who care, here is my silently removed comment, verbatim:

&gt;The orange outside is "flying fish roe", which is essentially caviar made out of fish eggs.

&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobiko

Here's my favorite quote from u/Spez:

&gt;*"Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. "*
