    <div class="md">You are preaching to the choir.  Prior to the 2016 election there was multiple viewpoints on that sub.  You can use internet archive or wayback machine to see this.   

You will also see a MOD overhaul of most "Default" subs and mass bannings of anyone that spoke out against the Narrative to Be.   This actually lead to TheDonald and other subs that are considered Right wing.   You will also see subs like conspiracy get mass brigaded (I still see them using mediamatters as a source.)

Politics quit using Shareblue/Mediamatters after months/years of criticism but they still are being pushed hard on MSM literal fake news.

Articles state politics was sold off for around 2mil.  Other subs no clue but they all had mod changes around that time.</div>

    <div class="md">I guess it just dumbfounds me in a way.  I get what your saying but its politics not r/democrats or r/The_Donald I can understand those subreddits downvoting opposing views but Shouldnt politics be about open discussion. Doesnt the auto mod state something about the subreddit being about open discussion? I could be wrong on that. </div>

    <div class="md">politics helds its rules in such a way that it will let others break it if it is within the narrative of what they are pushing.   Recently /r/videos was doing the same with the Covington Kids.   They only post politics related videos UNLESS it goes against the narrative then they ban it.  

If you actually look at /r/politics in a day to day basis its 90% anti-trump often fake news (let me know trump is done this time).   None of those stories pan out and most are dismissed as fake news in 72hrs.

politics as a subreddit was never like this in 2016.   Some of those stories paned out.   

It should be for open discussion but I dare you to state something or use a source for that fact on something that is actual news and not clickbait or antitrump.  In the first 30min you are downvoted -50.   Whether it is true or not.    

There are many subreddits breaking site wide rules and the Admins do nothing this is brought up time and again.  Pay attention to /r/undeleted for a bit.  At one time there had been 3 undeleted type subreddits. only undeleted is still active semi.

If you pay attention long enough you start to read the code like the matrix.   It's not a ban here or a ban there I can read it like it is a picture.</div>

    <div class="md">/r/undelete

It's a sub for mod deleted submissions. there was other subreddits like this because the defaults were working around the undeleted submissions.   One of the better methods was to just unlist it and relist for various reasons.

/r/UndeleteShadow and /r/UndeletePredictions are also subreddits that were used last election because reddit was die hard banning or deleting submissions en passe.    

UndeletePredictions was my favorite and I actually used it for the Covington Kids fiasco not long ago.  It was pretty accurate in 2016 because of the Narrative Reddit was pushing.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;how people just go with something without the facts or full context

This is happening all too often nowadays and it pisses me off. Everyone thinks they know everything. If there is missing information, they fill in the blanks themselves and assume the facts instead of waiting for the full story. We live in an age of instant gratification and people get angry if they don’t get the full story right away. We also live in a time where although it’s very progressive, there are too many stubborn people who will refuse to change their minds or admit they’re wrong even when called out. </div>

    <div class="md">That's actually the problem, the people who post on that sub actually think that the counterpart to it is the_donald.

They very intentionally take over or create seemingly neuteral sounding subs and then control the narrative to make it appear as though that is the popular opinion. It's just marketing.

    <div class="md">Reddit is a pretty left-leaning site. I don’t like how homogenous the conversation becomes sometimes when it comes to politics but, as a user-driven platform, it’s only natural that the site’s political demographics are reflected in /r/politics. If you like balanced discussion, try seeking out subs that promote it. /r/NeutralPolitics and /r/ExplainBothSides might be a good place to start.</div>

    <div class="md">I came here to post about the same thing, it isnt just me is it? Now because people have downvoted my comments, I can not post for up to 10-15mins at a time. This is DISGUSTING, REDDIT IS BECOMING LIKE COMMUNIST CHINA WTF MAN?  


Seriously, if Reddit continues to do this, they will open up a serious, SERIOUS can of worms. I am not making a threat here, but from what I have seen in the past, Anonymous, Hackers etc Reddit will get completely DDoSd and will have serious negative PR if this is this case.

    <div class="md">This seriously annoys me. We have nowhere to go and say "Hey, WTF? Censorship is not allowed" etc. We have nowhere to complain too. If we decided to go to another platform, that next platform will get well known and then the same thing will happen. If we stay here, we are basically an entire group of people that is shadow-banned; we won't hear the otherside of the debate and neither will the ~~cucks~~ otherside hear ours.</div>
