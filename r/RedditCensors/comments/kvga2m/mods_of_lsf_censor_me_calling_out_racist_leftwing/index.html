    <div class="md">&gt;Give a white or black child a choice between a white doll and a black doll and they'll more often than not choose the one that more resembles them.

First of all, the research of the day showed that black children would actually pick the white doll:

&gt;A majority of the children preferred the white doll and assigned positive characteristics to it.

[Source.](https://www.naacpldf.org/ldf-celebrates-60th-anniversary-brown-v-board-education/significance-doll-test/)

So you can't even seem to get the science behind your racist bullshit right.

Race exists, but this does not mean that children look up or down at people depending on their race. Every child if slapped by a white man and given candy by a black man would say that the black man was nicer.

Even children realize that merit and character has always mattered more than race.

In fact, socially, race is wholly irrelevant and always has been. Anyone who argues otherwise is regressive.

If you find yourself arguing that it's "only natural" to "stick to your own kind," please realize that this is the same language racist groups have used for decades.</div>

    <div class="md">We can oppose racism on a moral, logical and ethical basis, but it's ridiculous to suggest that there is no biological basis for it to exist.

Are you saying racism was invented in the 1500's or something? Evolutionary biology shows us that groups were most likely to survive if they were ethnocentric. If they didn't, they would either mingle with other groups or refuse to help their own, causing them to cease to exist as a distinct tribe. It's why we still have Bantu Hutus and Nilotic Tutsis in Rwanda thousands of years after the Bantu expansion.

Besides, this is in no way a "leftist" position. It would be if you started to assign blame and so on, but acknowledging a simple consequence of Darwinian theory doesn't make someone literally Stalin.</div>

    <div class="md">This is seriously saying, "*certain tribes lived with their families, so they were all clearly racist.*"

"Their kind" is their community; there were people of different races who lived within every tribal community at certain points. They were generally from outside of the community and in some cases they were hostile. You can see things like this from the native americans. It wasn't that the "white man" was "white", it was that they were outsiders who regularly slaughtered them. They could be identified by their race, and so they were.

Similarly in Africa.

And of course, the outsiders were perfectly content in cases to kidnap whatever tribe they ran into and force them to do labor.

None of this is a "biological" reason for the existence of racism, period. It's simply that you could identify "outsiders" by the different genetic attributes and race was used to identify people who weren't part of your community. That was also hundreds of years ago. For all of my life (I'm in my 30's), my "tribe" has been people from all different races. I'm an American and we live in what I was taught is a melting pot. Leftists are trying to change that to "salad" (or some weird metaphorical bullshit) so that we can make racial identity important again as a society. It's regressive.</div>

    <div class="md">It is in our nature. We prefer some traits in people over their alternatives. To insinuate that this is not the case would be hell of a task, and as the other commenter pointed out, all existing research points towards inherent bias. You say I'm indoctrinated, but unless you're willing to provide sources that prove we all have **zero bias** by default on something that significant to someone's appearance, you are factually wrong and actively spreading misinformation.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;zero bias by default on something that significant to someone's appearance

You want to talk about "bias based on appearance" when you see a man in a suit vs a fat, shirtless man covered in beer?

"*You're clearly biased - you don't want to be around the slob.*"

This has nothing to do with racism.

Racism is a **conscious thought** that manifests in observable behavior.

The reason "unconscious bias" is "unconscious" is because you can't argue against it. If you say "I'm not consciously biased tho" people will say, "Right! It's all *unconscious*, so you can't know! But I can tell!"

All of this is chasing the ghost of a ghost and pretending you caught it - how can anyone prove it one way or another when it's unconscious? Magic, obviously!

Of course everyone has biases regarding *appearance*, but this is not the same as having biases regarding *race.*

Like don't you just innately trust someone when they have brown eyes? Or have you never even associated eye color with trust?

I would never hire a person who has freckles, right? Because *freckles* is something you can see - you may be biased against freckles.</div>
