When you post on reddit is there a delay before a post appears in sub?

Just posted to a popular sub something which I didn't think was too controversial and although its in my profile, it does not seem to show on new in the sub.

Has it likely been hidden by mods?</div>

    <div class="md">I've seen posts commonly take up to 30 seconds to appear. Sometimes it can be several minutes, but not usually.

I can see your recent posts. There are a few ways you can check this yourself. One is to simply change the URL from reddit to ceddit. Another way, if you're on the desktop site, is to look for the "crosspost" feature. If that isn't there, the post was probably removed. Another way is to check under the new tab for the sub. Reddit will deceive you into thinking your post shows up by showing it to you under the default tab (what is it, 'hot'?), but they haven't extended this trick to the new tab. And, finally, if you've made a self post, just log out of your account and view it. If it was removed, you won't be able to see anything you typed. Instead, you'll see [removed].</div>

    <div class="md">Well it's now been 2 hours since posted.

Tried ceddit and wont even show the sub - r/FIFA

Not showing up under Hot or New.

Logged out (used different browser) and not only can I not see the post, when I search for my user name there is only one post comes up from some censor bot or something.

This was the post if interested:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/d34gu3/loot\_box\_shower\_thought/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIFA/comments/d34gu3/loot_box_shower_thought/)

&amp;#x200B;

Can see it in profile but it's just not there onm  the sub for me.

Not sure what d34gu3 is.</div>

&gt;Seeing as regulations on loot boxes seems to be raising its head again this got me thinking...
If they did get banned then that wonderful sweet spot at the start of FUT where everyone has random medium level teams would last for such a long time and make the game so much more random and (imo) fun.

&gt;Silvers and bronzes might be in teams until Xmas, full gold teams become the norm in the new year, IF/icon heavy teams become more prevalent spring /summer.

&gt;TBH sounds pretty good.

&gt;What do you think?</div>
