BTW, for that particular question, this answer made a lot of sense:

    <div class="md">&gt;Hi Everyone,

&gt;I'm going to have to lock this post. I know people hate that, and fairly so. ELI5 is an objective and impartial community, we literally have rules specifically banning soapboxing and any non objective topics.

&gt;It is very clear that this topic has both a. been addressed well, and b. is a topic that people cannot restrain themselves from veering into modern politics, particularly US politics. This is not the place for it.

&gt;I hope you all enjoy the learning that is still here, and you can let us know in mod mail if you have any questions (but please don't message us because you had a comeback you really wanted to make to someone on the other side of america's bizarre team sport version of politics).</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit censored proven examples of how Scientology shows misinformation about the Holocaust on YT. Reddit has become a bastion of liberal foolishness.

You can’t ask Reddit mods if a proven example of Scientology showing blatant misinformation about the Holocaust is accurate.  I showed links that proved Scientology made false claims about the Holocaust and had my entire thread removed.</div>
