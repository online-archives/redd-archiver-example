I posted 

&gt;Foreign and domestic troll farms, including foreign troll farms working for NATO, The U.S. govt and American politicians. The astroturfing, gaslighting, manufacturing consent, social media manipulation to control the narrative and discourse, is real

in response to:

https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/pxumdp/in_2019_almost_all_of_facebooks_top_christian/heq8xnz/

I also responded linking:

https://old.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/

but my comment did not show up.

I then responded to this user:

https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/pxumdp/in_2019_almost_all_of_facebooks_top_christian/heqln6v/

with a bit of a rant, something I am known to do:

&gt;Mostly progressives/leftists (I'm one of them), but the site is manipulated by the pro security state and military industrial complex liberal establishment (aka neocon friendly neoliberals/corporate centrists) and their shitlib dupes on the left (includes some mods of larger political subs who aren't already compromised/conflict of interest - see CTR/shareblue for example) who parrot their propaganda, disinformation and smears of anti-war anti-establishment leftists journalists/commentators/activists etc. Who are also behave authoritarian and pro censorship!

&gt;And the only time the dem establishment shills for Bernie or AOC is when their supporters criticize them over not going into open battle with dem leadership who don't fight fight for and or outright reject a popular progressive policy agenda. The second AOC or Bernie stops going along to get along (that has resulted in the same neoliberal status quo incrementalism we've been getting all along that helped pave the way for Trumps rise) and calls out dem leadership corruption, is the second those trolls (who enable a divided left and left and right divide to stave off class solidarity that would threaten the oligarchy) will go back to attacking and trying to sabotage AOC and Bernie.

&gt;Shitlibs eat the gaslighting and manufacturing consent from these trolls and or partisan hack MSM and parrot smears against fellow leftist that result in keeping the left divided and keep leaders from being held accountable and protect the corporate centrist dems who have an anti-progressive agenda. It's counterproductive but they are so brainwashed they will make excuse after excuse as to why we can't criticize leftist leaders and how they are supposedly always powerless, this is a cult of personality as much as it is them brainwashed by propaganda out the liberal establishment.

&gt;I see conservatives throw around the word 'liberal,' but it doesn't mean what you think it does. Liberals are not leftist and the dem party is not a left-wing party or a party of the working class, neither is the GOP. AOC has admitted this. Liberals are 'moderates' and 'centrists' and love censorship and apparently hate free press and whistleblowers.

I was then accused of being a troll (and putinbot from a user who follows me around Reddit) and continued to defend myself and ask what makes them think I am trolling and the user said this post and my entire post history, they would not specifically point to what it was that leads them to believe I was a troll. I told them my stances:

&gt;Well, I'm really a progressive and not a troll or shill. Can elaborate what about my post (rant) and 'entire comment history' leads you to believe I am a troll? I have promoted progressive policy, I'm anti-war/imperialism, I'm against the surveillance state, I've been critical of MSM bias, I'm against censorship and for pro free press. Pro election integrity and securing our elections. I have dared to criticize my leaders on the left and sought to hold them accountable. So what screams 'troll' or 'bad faith' exactly about my post and 'entire post history?'

And they continued to call me a troll. I then had all my comments removed and got this from the moderation there:

&gt;You have been permanently banned from participating in r/technology. You can still view and subscribe to r/technology, but you won't be able to post or comment.

&gt;If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/technology by replying to this message.

&gt;Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

I wrote to them: 

&gt;??? What did I do to warrant a permanent ban? Let along a normal ban? Also, I just noticed you removed my comments and those of me defending myself from being accused (and wrongly so) of being a troll, yet you keep up the replies from these users (at least 2 of them) who accused me of being a troll (how does that not violate rule of personal attacks?) one accusing me of being a putinbot. What in the actual fuck?

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/pxumdp/in_2019_almost_all_of_facebooks_top_christian/herl7gr/

and I have not yet heard back from them.

Edit: Oh, just now got a response:

&gt;You have been temporarily muted from r/technology. You will not be able to message the moderators of r/technology for 28 days.

Edit: Just noticing this comment chain and now I am not surprised what has happened to me.

https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/pxumdp/in_2019_almost_all_of_facebooks_top_christian/heqs1kb/

&gt;That would be Russia. They supported Trump, but they also pushed Bernie propaganda. Increasing political divisiveness serves to destabilize the country and slow the legislative process, regardless of whether the president is far right or far left, relative to the nation's populace of course. Either way it serves their needs.

The person who responded to them had their comment removed and was likely also perma banned.

Another user responded to this user with:

&gt;Found the Russian troll

And another with:

&gt;You're the worst troll I've ever met, but you're still a troll. I'll give you that.

The users citing the Mueller Report there, seemingly still pushing Russiagate, are of course upvoted.

I guess you can personally attack people and spread misinformation and disinformation without repercussion, just as long as it is in line with the mods bias, while those being attacked by these people, are censored and banned, while they try to defend themselves and even if they are speaking truth to power and not trolling. 

This is the cancer of social media and big tech = social media manipulation and censorship and it's only helping the two party duopoly, those who are anti-class solidarity and popular progressive policy and want people divided.</div>

    <div class="md">Well, this sums up the reasoning they gave me /u/karmagheden: 

&gt;post tons of hyper-partisan content elsewhere around the site. They're not engaging in good faith.

&gt;Someone who drops slurs so quickly and casually cannot be reasoned with 

&gt;This user's actions are extreme though and they clearly have a history that tells me they give zero fucks about changing/just want to screech.

&gt;We're willing to talk to people/issue temp bans/warn properly when appropriate. This user was here in bad faith/attacking others/dropping slurs. He waived his right to dialogue. 

&gt;their entire history is attacks, slurs, and extremist content. What makes you think a warning would change that? That's their identity, this isn't a moment of "heated exchange" or "them being upset/impulsive". They won't change.

I agree with them that your behavior is problematic. But I don't think a permanent ban with no reason + 1 month mute is appropriate.</div>

I did not ask you to speak with them on my behalf. You provided apologia when I was banned from Futurology and provided no response to me when I provided citation and pointed out that I wasn't aware that not doing so, was a ban warranting offense. I don't think that is even a rule. Let me also reply to your previous comment, shitlib is no worse of a slur than calling someone a troll. Maybe your kneejerk reaction has you thinking of the term libtard often used by conservatives? I  was directly called a troll and a putinbot, but those attacks aren't attacks and slurs in the eyes of the mods there, but I use the term shitlib and not even directed at another user and that warrants this outrage? What hyper-partisan content?  What leads them to believe I am not in good faith? Spending the time to defend myself against troll accusations? I am 100% in good faith and their entire take is just so ridiculous. As if your apologia wasn't bad enough. What problematic behavior? Calling out astroturf (my initial comment there that was upvoted) or pointing out how there is portion of the left who loves censorship and will twist themselves into pretzels to defend leadership from criticism and being held accountable and will attack fellow leftists for daring to do so. Bernie bro is just as bad, worse even as it is based on a myth, whereas shitlibs are actually a thing. Had I just said liberal or neoliberal, it would be all fine though, right? Mods with that mentality are what is wrong with the left, along with those who give apologia for their censorship. I don't know what else to say to their response but that it is so absurd. I do not post in bad faith and what hyper partisan content??? I criticize republicans and democrats and even progressive leaders. I have promoted unity and class solidarity. Isn't that the opposite of being a partisan hack??</div>

    <div class="md">I think, in speaking truth to power, I accurately described at least one mod over there and this would totally explain the response you got in addition to the initial perma ban, without reason given. Absolute garbage human/s and they should feel bad and be called out* by other leftists over their authoritarianism / mod abuse and censorship.</div>
