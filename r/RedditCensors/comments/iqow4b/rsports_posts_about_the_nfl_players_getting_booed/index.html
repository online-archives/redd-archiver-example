    <div class="md">Uh, you do know that reddit has sitewide rules that the mods have to enforce, right?

Whether their opinons are in agreement or not, it's their job to get rid shit that goes against reddit's community guidelines.

Stop trying to blame the mods for enforcing sitewide rules. This is literally their job. You know why subs get banned? Because mods don't do their jobs.</div>
