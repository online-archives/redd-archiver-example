In the post "Blaming 4chan/8chan for mass shootings because the shooters used it is the same as blaming videogames for violent acts, both are stupid "

I commented the following. Link to scrubbed comment here: https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/cmna7o/blaming_4chan8chan_for_mass_shootings_because_the/ew400rq/

&gt;Here's the problem: if people are radicalized by rhetoric, that rhetoric doesn't have to be of a sort that encourages them.

&gt;There's plenty of anti-white, white-hating rhetoric out there. There's no lack of leftists who say that mass immigration is going to doom white people, doom right-wing people in the US, that that's how they made California a uniparty state, and then when whites are a minority they're going to get punished and tormented and humiliated.

&gt;You don't need 4chan or 8chan to find that insulting and angering. THAT radicalizes people, especially by the flimsy standards people have for "radicalizing".

&gt;It's insane how a right-wing person saying "White people are being replaced by immigrants who will make their lives miserable" is wicked and violence inciting, but a left-wing person saying the exact same thing is what - funny? Cute?

&gt;Resa Azlan is on Twitter right now telling Trump's staff that they're monsters who need to be extinguished. Does that radicalize anyone? Do you think the threat of being extinguished radicalizes anyone?</div>

    <div class="md">I think you've got a good theory, and I don't believe you're wrong, but something else is definitely happening.

If it was strictly what you were saying, I think a lot more people would directly target the media, and the media personalities they don't like. 

So far, that hasn't happened. Which actually shocks me a little. I'm surprised someone from CNN or Fox News hasn't been capped off yet. That honestly surprises me. None of these mass shootings seem particularly well planned, or well thought out. New Zealand was the very first one where I figured it was planned ahead of time (and it was). All these other shootings appear to be much more random. I honestly don't understand it. It's fucking retarded.

Instead, it's mostly schools and other public areas used by almost entirely (except maybe school bullies and chads and the like) by people who are 100% completely innocent of everything that makes the shooter angry, or sets them off that end up being the locales affected.

I think the SSRIs are a HUGE FUCKING PROBLEM, just #1 off the top. We gotta stop with that shit, and now.</div>
