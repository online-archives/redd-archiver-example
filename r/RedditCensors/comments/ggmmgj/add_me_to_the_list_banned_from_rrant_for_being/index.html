    <div class="md">I just got banned from r/rant yesterday for something weird. Someone posted a rant against white people and other people were commenting how the person is being blatantly racist "fuck white people." 

My comment was me explaining how talking to lower income impoverished white people about white privilege usually gets negative responses because when you're talking to people at the bottom of the class pyramid about privilege, especially when you're not at the bottom, you're showing that you yourself are benefitting from class privilege...

I wasn't trying to be rude, just explaining why some people get annoyed when you try to talk to them about white privilege... then I got banned. 

All the other comments calling the op of the thread out had upvotes and those people got banned too... it's funny seeing "this comment was removed" and it has like 10+ upvotes...</div>

    <div class="md">EDIT: Man I just went through the mod team's profiles. All of them belong to stuff like /r/fragilewhiteredditor and others. Tons of cross overs. Constantly attacking white people and crying at anybody who goes against their hate. Oh well. This gives them a sense of power over others, they must live very sad little lives.

&amp;#x200B;

These mods are so power hungry and they all think alike. Click each mod, look at which subreddits they post on... it's all the same.

Hivemind enforcers trying to keep random subreddits, even non-political ones, from going against any wrong-speak.

I would put money on all these mods being controlled by a handful of people.</div>

That's actually against the rules, and you should report them to reddit. 

You can use https://reddit.com/report or contact them directly by https://reddit.com/contact.

Pretty clear-cut example of mod abuse if what you say is true (and I'm not doubting you at all btw, this shit happens all the time).</div>
