      <div class="md">Despite behavior in posting not changing (I have been posting regularly more or less since I made my account) and having posted to these subs in the past without issue and when I message the mods, I get no reply and my posts do not get approved. In a couple subs, the mods reply and apologize for my posts getting caught up in spam filter and approve them, while others will find a reason how the post is not appropriate or somehow is not allowed, even if it is not clear in the rules, but mostly I just do not hear back from the mods. Most recently I have noticed this on subs: videos, music, movies, television, funny, gifs. I posted to music the other day and my posts were immediately removed. I messaged the mods and asked why they were removed and perhaps it was spam filter and that it was not spam and if I could please get them approved and no response. I messaged them again a day or two later and again, no reply. Is anyone else having these issues? Just an example below.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/qigecr/londonbeat_ive_been_thinking_about_you/

Has anyone else experienced this? I looked this up and people are always saying 'just messaged the mods and ask them to approve you as a user so you don't have this issue' yet I can never get mods to reply on some subs, let alone help me with posting. I get where they are coming from but when you reach out with genuine query and only wish to contribute, only to get ignored, it seems kinda messed up.

Another big issue and this has been a thing for a long while now (since 2016 onward) in addition to subs (e.g. politics, politicalhumor, presidentialracememes, politicalvideo) seemingly being infiltrated at mod level / taken over by users (and possibly with help of admins, see PRM and director of policy having worked for Atlantic Council, part of NATO and ties to the CIA and British foreign office, see Chapo and other subs being banned) who are imperialist ans pro corporate center dem, is the abuse of automod to censor comments that have certain words or phrases. Efforts to control discourse and the narrative, while allowing CTR/Shareblue and pro security state/imperialism type trolls to spread propaganda and disinformation. I think that probably deserves it's own post or even megathread, but do others here notice this? I notice this happening more and on leftist subs like sandersforpresident, political_revolution, ourpresident, democraticsocialism, lostgeneration. demsocialist, dsa. The first one's to be co-opted by CTR/neoliberal types were subs like liberal, progressive, democrats. You also see subs like journalism and against_astroturfing seemingly taken over and suppressing healthy debate. I wonder how much of this is efforts out the political establishment and how much it is out the government/security state and military industrial complex/NATO. You may also notice subs like topmindsofreddit and subredditdrama (not to mention selfawarewolves, leopardsatemyface, hermancainaward, neoliberal) being watering holes for trolls who go to other subs (e.g. conspiracy and politics) to brigade. You also see a TON of censorship in larger subs like science, history, technology, futurology etc etc which seems accepted and ignored. Which brings me to another topic: social media manipulation (and you could totally write a paper or even a book about all this) but that is 1) how social media and big tech assist the political establishment and govt 2) that includes taking down content and tracking users 3) sites like Google and Youtube manipulating search results and suppressing content and likes/votes 'none authoratative sources' in their words aka MSM and not leftist independent media. 4) you have information sites like wikipedia that have bad faith actors scrubbing and sanitizing pages to protect people like Kamala, while doing the exact opposite for people like Assange or Jimmy Dore or Max Bluementhal, making them sound crazy and dishonest 5) you have 'fact-chekers' like snopes, politifact, fact-check.org and atlantic council and belingcat - which are partisan hacks and clearly have an agenda when they work to protect pro-war corporate centrist democrats. As you notice people's trust in MSM declines and everyone spending a ton of time on social media, more efforts are made by the government and politicians, in coordination with big tech, to control the narrative and discourse and mass public opinion and with the help of astroturfing and censorship. You may notice these efforts are dismissed as 'PR' or 'fact checking' or 'tacking misinformation' or 'correcting the correct' while they are often the opposite and deceptive (at best) but arguably insidious.</div>
