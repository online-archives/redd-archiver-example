    <div class="md">That's kind of what I was thinking too, but only I got the ban only 2 days ago.  I'd also been posting on the stated subreddit for a few weeks - but only got a ban when I posted something that irritated the hive mind and got massively downvoted/mass-reported.

Could be that an admin retroactively applied a ban, but forgot to specify a date.</div>
