      <div class="md">Gonne copy and paste my text from SRC (remember this text is from 2 months ago so time indications are not correct anymore):  

So I've never posted in that sub before, because I'm not from the Netherlands. I saw [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFLlyoi-fxs) of Geert Wilders in a debate some years ago and thought it could be interesting to post in the biggest Netherlands sub around.  

Another user even commented on my post like an hour back (only now I checked if It was removed or something). That comment is also not visible anymore. Here's the link to my post: https://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5yszrz/in_light_of_the_upcoming_dutch_elections_heres_a/ . You can see "1 comment" but nothing there.

Figuring It was shadowbanned, I looked in the new-tab of this subreddit and there's only a few posts this afternoon, the rest is hours old at the very least, my post should be in there. [It's not](http://imgur.com/a/igZZg), my post is nowhere to be seen. You can look at my post history or [here](http://imgur.com/a/PVkxl)
 that I posted it around 1-2 hours ago.  


So my post was shadowbanned I presume, but was I? Maybe just my post? Nope. I picked [a random thread to comment on](http://imgur.com/a/KsZrI) which is a neutral comment, just said "waow!". I can see my comment when I post one on this thread, but it doesn't show up [here, when using incognito](https://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5yt5li/turkse_minister_voor_familiezaken_op_weg_naar/). [Here you can see what I see when clicking the np link and looking at my comment](http://imgur.com/a/sPDjX), so my comment is still there (for me to see only).

It says there's 20 comments, but if you count (at this very time of course, this most likely won't be accurate in some minutes/hours or later) there's only 18. 2 people are shadowbanned, including me.  

This sub however does NOT ban/remove/shadowban etc. posts that are anti-Geert Wilders, as seen [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/thenetherlands/comments/5yqddu/why_wilders_doesnt_worry_the_dutch/), a thread that says Geert Wilders does not care about the common Dutchman (his voters, implied). It would seem only pro-Geert Wilders' posts (or maybe even comments) are censored.

Yet another sub censoring posts &amp; posters that do not fit the narrative, as my post was not racist, aggressive towards others or against their subreddit's policy (guidelines/rules). If my title "was the problem" (as is used many times to censor dissenting opinions), I would expect a remove and maybe a message stating the title was inappropriate. Then I would've just re-uploaded with the title of the YT-video. Alas.  

Added text: It seems like all of these /r/[insert country here] subs are also turning more leftist cancerous over time. If you look at some of these subs &amp; their mods, half the time you can see a (small) powermod there too, no doubt installed there to keep the narrative going. They mod places like shitamericanssay, europe, worldnews etc...</div>

    <div class="md">/r/thenetherlands is run by jippiejee, a former /r/europe mod that was kicked out from that mod team because his censorship was too extreme even for /r/europe's standards, which is a bit like getting kicked out of the Stasi for being too Communist.

&gt; It seems like all of these /r/[insert country here] subs are also turning more leftist cancerous over time.

Every national sub that I know of is in the hands of a pro-censorship leftist. I don't know exactly how it came to be, but that's how it is. That's why /r/european was so successful.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah... I got banned from /r/Belgium yesterday, there was a thread about Trump coming to Belgium/Europe and more people than usual were fed up with the fake protests and shit, fake outrage all the time about people who only listen to the news etc. I made a joke about free helicopter rides and got permabanned by JebusGobson who's friends &amp; another mod with people who make "jokes"/jokes like this : http://i.magaimg.net/img/mde.png . Idk if they're serious even or a joke but ... helicopter jokes = bad, advocating white genocide = okay ... Either all jokes go, or none. *sigh*. Is DEUS VULT now also advocating mass genocide to muslims and retaking Jerusalem from the muslims/Jews for the Christians? Like wtf they're jokes &amp; memes, idc if you like them or not. There were enough Trump bashing jokes, memes and posts on that sub allowed though...

The funniest part is, I was discussing people on that thread and was upvoted more than the people I was responding too, so let's just say I had "support", even for my helicopter joke. The mod who banned me is mod of like 60 subs and used to be a europe mod : https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditcancer/comments/3wsla2/reurope_mod_ujebusgobson_censors_a_thread_about/ or here : http://i.magaimg.net/img/mf2.png (this is not my image initially) .  

EDIT: here's anarchism sub advocating mass violence, executions/death, etc. : http://imgur.com/NZKGqt1  

Here's a default powermod (still very active btw) openly calling for the assassination of a politician (Trump) he doesn't like including the supporters: http://archive.is/UIoEf . *Sigh*.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh so I was banned for shitposting in another sub, even though my post wasn't a shitpost or a troll, yeah? It was a political video about Geert Wilders, that's it. You're in /r/redditcensors here yeah and you now just admitting /r/theNetherlands automatically shadowbans anyone posting in T_D even if their posts aren't trolls or calls to violence, just "bam", banned. Disgusting power abuse and power tripping.</div>

    <div class="md">It was upvoted 5 times in a matter of minutes and someone commented on it positively. It's the MODS, not the "people" who disapproved. If you're trying to defend yourself with "muh people", then it should've stayed up and downvoted to hell. That's how it works. Also again, just shadowbanned for posting in another sub, isn't that against reddit overall policy &amp; rules? Also no notification, I asking the mods &amp; no answer, ever. It's simple, they don't care, they're power tripping, they're purging all "dissenting" opinions rather than letting their own users upvote &amp; downvote what they want and they deliberately ignore you when you respectfully ask for an explanation.</div>
