      <div class="md">Today I posted an article to /r/WorldNews:

Female teacher, 29, escapes punishment for having sex with her student, 16, because he was 'experienced in love-making and knew exactly what he was doing'

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7156467/Female-teacher-29-let-having-sex-student-16.html?ito=rss-flipboard

Here's the link to the thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c2ja3e/female_teacher_29_escapes_punishment_for_having/

After about 2 or 3 hours, as the post gaining popularity with almost 100 upvotes, the post was silently removed. The reason given was "inappropriate subreddit."

Do a search for "rape" on that subreddit. Funny how it's quite alright to post threads about the United States President being a rapist, despite how that flies directly in the face of their "no US news" rule, but posting about women raping boys is not something "appropriate" for the subreddit.

I messaged the moderators asking why it was removed:

Here's my message in text if you don't want to click on the image:

&gt;My post with almost 100 upvotes was just suddenly removed citing "inappropriate subreddit." But the subreddit is completely appropriate. This is definitely world news. It isn't opinion. It isn't old. All the rules are followed. And according to the votes, 85% of people agree. Why would you remove the post??

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c2ja3e/female_teacher_29_escapes_punishment_for_having/

Here's the reply I received from the moderator team:

http://magaimg.net/img/88xh.jpg

Yep, that's right. They said to not talk to them then immediately muted me.

This has to stop. Boys and girls are being raped by people in authority positions. If children are not old enough to be able to consent when they are raped by men, then neither are those raped by women. 

The /r/WorldNews moderators are helping female rapists by continuing to suppress and censor articles about it. The more these articles are kept out of the spotlight, the more people will continue to believe female rapists do not exist, and the more there will continue to be victims, both girls and boys, of these disgusting women.</div>

You cant argue your ideas, because they have no valid basis  

It's sad that you've fell down that path in life. I hope you find the error in your views and live a more logical life.</div>

    <div class="md">None of these "implicate" the left in being "pro pedophilia"

The first story is dubious at best and not even sourced. Which isn't surprising because it's obvious what has happened when you watch the whole video. They mentioned pedastry one time in the curriculum as an example of how societies views on sex change. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-pedophilia-school/ Snopes already debunked this one bro, by your logic if you teach about the existence of anything you're endorsing it which is not how education works. How is you failing to actually look at the syllabus "the lefts" fault?

The second story is basically someone not doing a background check. How is that the lefts fault? 

Third story again, how does Bill Clinton maybe being a pedo the lefts fault? I wasn't aware the left said "oh by the way Clinton can you rape kids for us? It's on our evil Jewish agenda"

Literally no connection with those stories and us lefties, use critical thinking and actually research stuff before you believe it.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah damn activists using tactics from a book about *checks notes* activism. 

Really people can talk about cultural Marxism like we all signed up to a group email to destroy the west (oh how I wish it was real) . 

But is there concrete evidence for it? That communists and socialists are infiltrating every facet of society with Marxist culture?  If we are doing it, nothing is happening because both the big two of US and UK are still inbetween third wave and neoliberal in policies

Calling genetic fallacy doesn't negate that the two ideas are pretty much identical if you ignore the Jew parts (though just from that thread you can see some are committed to that as well). The same flaws in the Nazis cultural bolshevism and it being propeganda, can usually be found in the idea of "cultural Marxism". No they're not the exact same by they are family.

It's been debunked by so many people at this point, the Threw Arrows and Shuan on YouTube have both had great takedowns of this idea. 

And everyone here forgets Marxism was born in the west by a Brit and a German, and not by the "evil Muslims" or by Russians.</div>

That's not evidence. Explain how that is evidence. Anyone can post a few photos and a headline and call that evidence, doesn't make it so. Facts don't care about your feelings. 

Again how does any of that implicate the left?

    <div class="md">I mean that entire comment is a massive "Citation Needed". 

Just because colleges and universities produce people who agree on certain issues doesn't mean they're brainwashing people. 

Most graduates now believe in climate change compared to students in say 1960s. Were they brainwashed or did scientific evidence and analysis by people like professors and research change people's views? 

Of course science and social studies are different and you can't use numerical metrics as easily in social studies but the idea that concensus on issues can't change organically through new understanding and knowledge, is arrogant at best. 

Not everything is a conspiracy and people who demand safe spaces for mundane things aren't necessarily representative of an entire spectrum of the political system</div>

Source?

A source. I need a source.

Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.

No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.

Do you have a degree in that field?

A college degree? In that field?

Then your arguments are invalid.

No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Correlation does not equal causation.

CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.

Nope, still haven't.

    <div class="md">Damn this is why politics is fucked up. As a centralist, you are both retarded... I probably agree more with left politics in theory alone but realistically neither side deserves any power because they are both inept, childish and extreme. Im 90% sure the majority of people who are actually big into this whole left vs right thing dont know anything about politics and inheret their 'allegiance' through their family, childhood area and biased media. Neither left or right will work independently. That is why centralism is the only thing that makes sense. You go all right or all left, you piss off a lot of people and neglect the good policies the other side had. This usually leads to a shitty government. Then it switches sides and leads to a shitty government.

While it's impossible to keep everybody happy, neither sides are good enough choices to get worked up about. As I am a left leaning centralist, id be interested to hear why people are right sided cause honestly, I think the majority of their views are kinda dumb. Im only centralist because the actual left is ridiculous and Id agree with the more nationalistic approach to governing.</div>

    <div class="md">They will probably shadow ban you as well. You will still be able to up and down vote and post to r/worldnews but only you will be able to see it. You'll start to wonder why no one is reading your posts, it is because You've been banned but they lack the balls to tell you to your face. I was told that r/worldnews was a decent sub. Apparently not. Reddit is going to shit. Its no longer open to free speech. Its to full of social justice warriors. Anyone care to start a new reddit? Id join.</div>

    <div class="md">Agree with the mods, not the sub for that - world news is about world news and not individual ragebait stories

That being said - mods do let slide a lot of content that fits their biases. They apply rules selectively - unsure if they realize that. They are much more likely to remove news for being of a local natureif it doesn't fit their world view.</div>
