    <div class="md">"First, it must be understood that “pit bull” is not a breed. Attempts at legal definitions of what a “pit bull” is are outrageously inconsistent and no breed club or genetic definitions exist at all. Visual identification of dogs of unknown origin is also highly unreliable. Quite frankly, you don’t know a “pit bull” dog when you see one. It’s a highly subjective label with no agreed upon definition."

"Nor is there any credible data on bite injury severity by breed. Some reports by physicians make the claim that “pit bull” dogs are over-represented among severe injury cases, but all rely on visual breed identifications which research proves is unreliable. This is unsurprising, as the most comprehensive study to date of dog bite related fatalities has demonstrated that even in these intensely investigated cases, it is impossible to reliably identify the breed(s) of dog(s) involved in the vast majority of cases. [ii] Newspaper reporters, doctors, legislators, even so-called dog professionals continue to perpetuate these myths based on hearsay, hype, and unreliable information."

I mean on the most basic level a "pitbull" is bull and terrier mix, they are "mutts" which makes labeling harder compared to say a germen shepherd, but a none pure breed with those 2 breeds in it is gonna be a "pitbull".</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah. I will always say owner and how a dog is raised is way more important, but dog breeds do have certain dispositions to strengths and psyches, larger dogs are naturally stronger, and some breed like "pit bulls" are stronger then similar size breeds. Likewise their psyche while not a hard and fast rule, do have certain dispositions. A good number of breeds are not met for just any owner, and certain breeds attract the wrong kind of owners. People really should not be getting certain breeds unless they have raised animals before and know what they are doing. A chihuahua for example might be small, but it is a hard headed breed and requires a knowledgeable owner, thankfully they are small so when they are raised badly their bites aren't bad, but don't think just size and strength alone is a indicator of breed psyche dispositions (just dawned on me chihuahua and shitzu, that would be a scary mutt in terms of psyche).</div>
