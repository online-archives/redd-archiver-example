Title of the post: "IsItBullshit: George Floyd resisted arrest"

Content of the post: 

According to the [Minneapolis police report](https://www.startribune.com/mpls-police-still-haven-t-explained-misinformation-after-floyd-s-death/570970152/), George Floyd had "physically resisted" as he was being arrested. However, [according to one witness](https://fox6now.com/2020/06/05/witness-george-floyd-didnt-resist-arrest-tried-to-defuse-things/), George Floyd "didn't resist" and even tried to "defuse" the situation.   

I then looked to other sources to find out more.

When I went looking to see whether or not this was true (that George Floyd resisted arrest), I found several news articles reporting that George Floyd did not resist arrest. The following are a few that I found:

[Surveillance video does not support police claims that George Floyd resisted arrest
](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/28/us/video-george-floyd-contradict-resist-trnd/index.html)

[Video doesn’t appear to show George Floyd resisting arrest as cops claimed
](https://nypost.com/2020/05/27/video-does-not-appear-to-show-george-floyd-resisting-arrest/)

[George Floyd’s friend, witness to his death speaks out: He did not resist arrest
](https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-floyds-friend-witness-death-speaks-resist-arrest/story?id=71084042)

From the news articles I found, the evidence seems conclusive. From these reports, it can be concluded that George Floyd had not, in fact, resisted arrest. 

**Following up with these articles, I looked to the surveillance video to see what it showed.** 

I found a New York Times video that shows, with timestamps, how George Floyd was arrested: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vksEJR9EPQ8

In this video, it does not appear that he was resisting, as well as in the following pieces of footage I also watched: 

Also, in NBC's "Minute-to-Minute breakdown," it also shows a lack of resisting arrest from George Floyd: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiSm0Nuqomg

Finally, this Washington Post, another minute-by-minute breakdown video, seems to also show George Floyd not resisting arrest:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMGUAHBFmjk

**However, it was until I came across this following piece of footage of George Floyd being arrested that I thought it impossible that he resisted arrest:**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4ABfJCw9Ls&amp;feature=youtu.be

In this video clip – interestingly titled "George Floyd missing footage" – it does appear to show George Floyd, in some sense, refusing to cooperate with officers. In the video, George Floyd does appear to resist arrest. 

**Does this mean that George Floyd "physically resisted" arrest as the police department claimed, or does it not?** 

**Does what was in the video qualify as "resisting arrest"?**</div>
