    <div class="md">&gt;* Can't really ban evade if the second wub was made before the ban.

That's just semantics &amp; splitting hairs. Knowing that the sub has a good chance of being banned in the future, it's entire possible to create a fallback sub in anticipation of that. 

[Ban evasion can also refer to a subreddit being created or repurposed to reconstitute or serve the same objective as a previously banned subreddit.](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/what-ban-evasion)

I didn't make the rules.</div>

    <div class="md">Even then, the only flaw in the original sub was the name and not the actual content. It's not like the subreddit had a toxic community, or the content was inherently toxic to begin with. 

Not only that, but from the basis of the quote, I'm pretty sure it would only count if the actual ban was to do with the content of the sub. If it's just a name that was the issue, I highly doubt they would take issue with another subreddit popping up that corrected that issue. Otherwise ban evasion as a rule is inherently flawed in its purpose, since its standards are incredibly loose at that point.</div>
