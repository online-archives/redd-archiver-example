    <div class="md">Guess they got worried people would start realizing that the point isn't to actually interview people and have good journalism, but instead be a racist piece of shit. Best part is, when the guy tells her "I can't have 'white privilege,' I'm black" she immediately says she was "given wrong information." So you're told someone is white and you immediately judge them based on that? Don't we fire journalists for being super racist? Hmmmmmmm..... </div>

    <div class="md">**Weasel word**

A weasel word, or anonymous authority, is an informal term for words and phrases such as "researchers believe" and "most people think" which make arguments appear specific or meaningful, even though these terms are at best ambiguous and vague. Using weasel words may allow someone to later deny any specific meaning if the statement is challenged, because the statement was never specific in the first place. Weasel words can be a form of tergiversation, and may be used in advertising and political statements to mislead.

Weasel words can soften or under-state a biased or otherwise controversial statement.

Yeah, that's a great excuse for ignoring discussions about societal problems caused almost entirely by blacks and latinos</div>

    <div class="md">The only toxic racist here is the woman in the OP story,

spewing her hate speech about "white male privilege". 

Typical racist shaming attempt when one of these cretins has no real argument. 

You don't have to be right wing to despise such toxic racism and sexism. </div>
