    <div class="md">And they unbanned and then banned me again just for trying to figure out which rule had actually been broken. I literally just wanted to figure out why they thought posting a reaction video to their own subreddit was a banworthy offense / rule break.

Basically they just hate Wypipo like pewds laughing at their own posts.

Also the gallery posts are all completely in the wrong order, and I can't figure out how to rearrange them. Actually I think I got them in the right order now, might not be updated in the linked gallery yet though.</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit has an agenda to push along.. anything that is funny AT a person of color, in any way, gets negative attention.

For example - the Trashy subreddit is 95% making fun of white people.

These censorship loving mods are doing more harm than good.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh piss off. Its not antagonizing to ask for a VALID REASON for why you were banned, they were only antagonized because THEY KNEW I hadn't broken any actual rules or done anything wrong. They are literally just offended if a white person records a reaction video to their own material just because he's white.</div>

At best, you should've not stooped to their level and just say fuck'em and move on. At worst, you just needed your ego stroked and needed to feel vindicated.

    <div class="md">Or you're just so dense that you can't even realize I wanted to figure out why they thought the video was a banworthy offense based on their rules, and because I simply wanted to challenge them so I could post and expose them, I wasn't actually at all bothered about being unbanned - I had simply said I wanted the ban 'reviewed' and an explanation as to how the video I posted broke their rules, not just 'YOU BROKE THE RULES, DONT DO IT AGAIN'.

And maybe take a moment to think why you are being down voted here.</div>

    <div class="md">He saw something wrong and he addressed it. He is in the right here. 

Just because he gets his way does not mean he walks away - if his interactions with the mods convinced even one of them to be more selective when banning people he has done a good thing snd possibly prevented someone else from being unjustly banned.

Also consider one of the mods is being abusive to him, now suppose in two years time that mod says or does something inappropriate on another reddit he moderates someone might remember his name and further question that mods behaviour. </div>

    <div class="md">Asking for clarification for why you were banned isn't antagonizing. After all, if you did break a rule that you were unaware of, best to notify the user of that rule during the unbanning. Otherwise they'll eventually just end up doing it all over again. </div>
