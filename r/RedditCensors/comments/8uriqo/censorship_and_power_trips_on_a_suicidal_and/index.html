      <div class="md">Some of you may be familiar with the old sub /r/SanctionedSuicide. It was basically a support and venting community for suicidal people to talk and relate their feelings without the standard platitudes or absolutist "pro-life" political correctness that they might get on the more mainstream subs like suicidewatch or /r/depression.  [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidology/comments/84f911/rsanctionedsuicide_and_rtruesanctionedsuicide/) outlines pretty well what it meant to people. The unfamiliar may find the title confronting, but it was, in essence, an unconventional support group. The sub was banned because people were too openly talking about suicide methods, sharing information on where to get barbiturates etc. 
/r/TimeToGo was created as a successor that banned any encouragement but still had the spirit of the old sub. It's only existed for about three months, but all of the original founders have now been booted/driven out and it has been taken over by someone on a power trip who clearly doesn't give a shit about the community. 

**TL;DR:** I realize most won't want to read this wall of text, so [this post outlines everything that happened pretty well.](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8rh4ww/a_query_on_the_state_of_the_community/). It was, of course, removed. 


**Summary of the new rules:**

* Criticism of Reddit or the admins is not allowed. 

* The automod removes all mention of /r/FreeToGo, a duplicate community for people sick of their bullshit.

* Banning of the word normie. 

* Post titles must be 30 characters long.

* Account must be 2 days old. 

* Account must have 50 comment karma. These last two are especially dumb because of how many people use throwaways or sub-specific accounts for posting about this kind of stuff. Their excuse is they review the posts afterwards and *might* reinstate them. 

* Seems to be as soft ban on coarse language. Some words may be automodded.

* Ban anyone who disagrees with the mods too much or even just asks questions they dislike, no matter how polite.

* Any posts calling this out of course go bye-bye, no matter how polite. 

* Overall philosophy of wanting the sub to be "respectable" and sanitize it for non-suicidal people and some delusional view that they're going to change the world and euthanasia laws with the sub. I think it goes without saying how ridiculous that is trying not to offend people with language given the nature of the community and why it exists. If they wanted to make a new sub like that, fine, but they've hijacked an already existing community that was meant for venting and free expression. This is the last place people need more language policing.

**Relevant events with ceddit links:**

1. [Don't be mean to our lovely Reddit hosts.](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8qi5bb/mod_please_be_respectful_of_reddit_its_not_their/) Disagreement is "divisive propaganda".

1. [Using the word "normie" is apparently "incel talk" that will be banned soon. Someone makes a thread about it.](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8pwv7u/were_going_to_be_filtering_out_inceltalk_very/). Locked and removed. User account suspended for apparent ban evasion. 

2. [Someone makes a thread about OPs ban. Mods caught lying about deleting posts.](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8qpxri/some_information_i_think_is_relevant_to_everyone/) Locked and removed

3. [Same poster asks why the last original mod was de-modded without notice] 
(https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8r6sn2/one_of_our_former_moderators_df90_was_demodded/) Locked and removed. OP banned. 

4. Then the[ query on the state of the community post](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8rh4ww/a_query_on_the_state_of_the_community/) (same as the tl;dr one) was made. Reason why it was banned? ["Off-topic and trolling"](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeToGo/comments/8psgmj/meta_open_discussion_a_place_to_talk_about_almost/e0snh2b/?context=3)

5. [A former moderator speaks up on the state of the community.](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8rj67n/a_plea_from_a_former_mod_to_the_present_mods/) Locked and removed. 

6. The response of the current top mod viking_irl was to dig through his post history and [call him out on a post he made during a difficult time in an attempt to shame and silence him.](http://removeddit.com/r/TimeToGo/comments/8rk4rl/imhumbleo_i_think_your_present_lifestory_is/) Then she realised she was getting too much backlash and quickly removed it. What a kind and caring ward for a suicide subreddit.

7. He calls this out in the [open discussion thread](http://www.ceddit.com/r/TimeToGo/comments/8psgmj/meta_open_discussion_a_place_to_talk_about_almost/) to ask her why, which has more discussion of general censorship. I think this user sums it up pretty well with the top comment: *"The title says "open discussion" in all caps, but five out of the six top level comments have been removed. The discussion here is less open than the one during the last Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea."*
He also made another post inviting people to this discussion thread to highlight what was going on. That was also locked, of course. 

8. Another thread where another mod grieving_wife makes [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TimeToGo/comments/8rnm1n/when_do_you_think_we_will_see_true_progress_in/e0t3tl8/) that's pretty enlightening to the apparent new direction of the sub. Everyone disagrees. Never responds to any of the critcism. Again, thread locked.

9. [Also relevant. Asking the community to vote for what they want. Removed.](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8rx04y/question_what_would_you_like_a_place_where_you/).


There was a lot going on and I probably missed some relevant stuff. I saw most of the main threads as they went up. They were heavily upvoted and the top mod's viking_irl's comment karma is now in the toilet at -100. Not that internet points mean anything but I think it's clear how the community feels. They simply ignore, deflect or delete anything pointing this out. 

Sorry for the giant post, I'm just really pissed that that a great place that offered a lot of people comfort which was just getting back on its feet after a ban has now been squashed by power-tripping assholes. What really stings is they dress it in language of respectability but really just want to push their own agenda and ban anyone who doesn't like it, all while pretending to be kind and caring to a community of already exhausted and vulnerable people. 

Anyway, if anyone is interested /r/FreeToGo is the alternative sub which is again, being [auto-purged on TTG](https://snew.github.io/r/TimeToGo/comments/8scykg/how_did_you_find_this_sub/) if anyone mentions it.
