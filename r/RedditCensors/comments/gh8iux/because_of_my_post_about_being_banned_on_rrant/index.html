    <div class="md">Except reporting mods is worthless on this website. Mods are almost always violating the moderator rules with things like this, and it's very clear in the mod guidelines. But reddit's admins couldn't care less about mods breaking rules. The report system has been ignored and pushed out of reach. Reddit admins are useless.

The only time I have ever seen admins take action against people are when politics are involved  and they punish people that they don't agree with, while supporting those who break the rules to push their own political beliefs. Garbage admins only remove what they get paid to remove. ~~This can also tie in to how reddit's administration is being paid my china to remove hk posts and whatnot.~~</div>

    <div class="md">Oh no!  Those are such good subs!  /s

You have to understand reddit is these losers’ entire life and their only identity so you aren’t questioning an idea when you post something they don’t agree with you’re literally questioning their entire life and feelings of nonexistent self-worth so they MUST use all their power to smite you, since they finally have some over something.

They won’t even defend their ideology in good faith because it doesn’t exist, it’s just whatever the hive mind tells them to believe, and right now it’s "white people bad because trump" since if you don’t agree with them you’re obviously "on the other side."

Useful idiots used to further sow division by masters they don’t even know they have.</div>
