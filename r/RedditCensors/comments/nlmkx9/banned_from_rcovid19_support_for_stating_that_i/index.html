      <div class="md">The moderators on [r/COVDI19\_support](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/) are nuts.

Someone posted an article about how surface transmission due to covid is basically impossible.

I posted a comment about my experience testing positive for covid, at a time when I lived alone and had everything delivered. And how I talked to a contact tracer that said that many people he talked to had no idea how they got covid. So getting it from surfaces can happen, but is really hard to prove, given that millions of people don't know where they got it in the first place.

So just questioning what the CDC said got my posts removed, and then after calling out the moderator I got banned.

As if the CDC was right 10000% of the time. Like how dare I even question what they say. The fact is, that the CDC has flip flopped on essentially everything. Every. Thing.

I am disgusted at the level of censorship and policing that is going on. It's absolutely disgusting that people are not allowed to discuss their very real experiences. I wonder how many other people out there have had experiences or have very thoughtful eye opening opinions that are ignored.

**Edit:** Check out the moderators comment below, trying to defend her decision to BAN me over a harmless comment (lol). Her comment really reflects what is wrong with people in society today.

By the way, my initial comment got **4 upvotes** and people were really respectful and engaged within the subgroup, so its not like I was being downvoted into oblivion. People were actually interested in what I had to say.

**Edit #2 :** The moderator just told me that I need therapy LOL (see comment below). She actually encouraged me to go "rant" about my experience in a different community and then when I go do that, she tells me I need mental help. Can't make this stuff up.</div>

    <div class="md">You’re not allowed to think for yourself on Reddit. Gotta fly with the hive mind or they kick you out.  Reddit banned people for saying Covid could have come from the Wuhan lab and lo and behold it turned out to be a possibility. 

I believe you and wouldn’t be surprised if it’s surface transferred.</div>

    <div class="md">I only brought up the notion that it could be transmitted via surface more often than we know because it's really hard to track down surface transmission, and those cases might expose people to lower viral loads leading to mild illness.
I also noted that I tested positive for covid while living alone and having no exposure to people and when I talked to the contact tracer and my doctor they said I could have gotten it from a surface potentially and was told that a lot of people don't know how they got it, so it's not like every case is due to known exposure.

I could be wrong, but I don't think my comments should be removed nor that I should be banned. There was no reason to delete my comments when someone could have just responded and disagreed with what I said.

People are so obsessed with spreading "misinformation" that they start censoring anyone that dare question anything.

You are right that there were so many arguments made around covid that people were called conspiracy theorists for, but they turned out to be right.</div>

    <div class="md">Welcome to the reality of reddit and social media and remember  "Say what we want or you will be silenced" is now considered acceptable and has been being normalized for years.

This isn't new and sadly your just seeing it, remember when those crazy people said "if they can ban this they will ban you one day" well it's happening all over.

I remember the old days of reddit, back in the "before" when it was actually free, even for people that disagreed.  I miss those days and it's why I keep coming back hoping to find it but it's worse every time.</div>

Edit: l notice you didn't respond to trying to explain what prion disease is. Don't you know?</div>

    <div class="md">All the elitest academic pos acting as if laymans can't do a simple search and read through research papers which are grammatically done at a 8th grade level. 

You must be trying hard to fight your innate racist views you've buried deep within your priviledge. 

Prion diseases cause dementia what your slowly suffering from hence your parroting like traits 😉

What happened to your addons to your name, add that PhD again so you can feel special inside. lmfao your a academic loser face it. 

I can't say I truly feel sorry for you, but I kinda do. smh. All your life work academically is subpar, stick with your research rather than on social media. I swear these academics are such wasted space, when you see them acting like this. ☝️

The misfolds may have already started with this one. smh..

Smirky as smile, you related to Bill Gates?

Per your edu background

My undergraduate degree is in Archaeology and Anthropology from Cambridge University (Part II Biological Anthropology). My dissertation was on sexual dimorphism in Australopithecus afarensis.

LMFAO undergrad dissertation, weak as shit. wth is this bullshit.

Your PhD thesis is even shittier, they just handing out them PhD's now like candy.

per your edu background

My PhD Thesis, entitled "The Role of Online Discussion Forums During a Public Health Emergency", explored how a peer-to-peer forum could be configured to provide high-quality, trusted information during a serious disease outbreak.

Really, this is what your THESIS was on? 

People are we starting to see a trend with this 🐍 in the grass on social media.

per your edu background

From 2017 I have been the Public Health Policy Advisor to the Rockefeller Foundation Economic Council on Planetary Health at Oxford University. 

Sounds like your nothing more than a academic shill. Or a handicapped academic troll due to the misfolds. 🤷🏿‍♂️

How much you getting paid, any consultant work.. shall we investigate this to see if we have any conflicts of interests with you?

Back to your echo chamber, the only place you can survive without threat from the facts of your lies.</div>

Academics of your stature should think twice about calling a person a troll. Pretty beneath oneself, unless your a troll yourself. Which you are. 😉

Again just another wasted PhD, how much money was wasted on you. However ROI another drone for global narrative push can be considered priceless depending on the funder and goal at hand.</div>

If so, what do you think the exam process does? Or marking essays? Or the supervision process? Or peer review? All of them weed out lower quality information and filter for the best.

    <div class="md">The encouragement isn't to find new and novel angles on solving problems or showing validation in theories, rather it's to push narratives of the highest bidder thats funding a study. 

How did Monsanto get approval of what it is doing to nature by introducing unnatural crops into the eco system, had to get peer review papers to prove and set the narrative for themselves. What better way than to pay pos PhD holders that are shit bags to shore up their defense academically so they can defend themselves in litigation. 

Just an example of what your peer review process is, which is a joke. 

Sounds like your a sellout to the highest bidder and it was the technocrats in this case.</div>

    <div class="md">That's not how the peer review process works, nor the academic funding process. By Monsanto's 'unnatural' crops l presume you mean crops that have been modified to grow (or grow with greater yield) under climatic/soil conditions others won't, or to contain higher levels of vitamins than 'natural' crops? I doubt the development of any of those was funded by academic funding and you'll find plenty of criticism of Monsanto's business practices at academic conferences. You'll also find plenty of African academics making it clear that Monsanto breeds are all that stands between their home regions and starvation. Good to get a sense of the full range of conspiracy nonsense you buy into though.</div>

    <div class="md">Keep glazing over the realities just like what your PhD thesis was on. 


per your edu background 

I hold a PhD from Royal Holloway, funded under a Reid Scholarship in Health, the Human Body and Behaviour, administered through the School of Biological Sciences and co-supervised by the departments of Computer Science and Geography. My PhD Thesis, entitled "The Role of Online Discussion Forums During a Public Health Emergency", explored how a peer-to-peer forum could be configured to provide high-quality, trusted information during a serious disease outbreak.

You ain't fooling anybody, your a paid shill.

FYI You are aware the non self pollinating crops isn't the way to stop people from starving or lower the cost of crops in developing nations. It's like your a white privilege having PhD shit bag, wait a sec that is what you are. 😉</div>

    <div class="md">A Chinese Communist Party military scientist who got funding from the National Institutes of Health filed a patent for a COVID-19 vaccine in February last year — raising fears the shot was being studied even before the pandemic became public.

Zhou Yusen, a decorated military scientist for the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) who worked alongside the Wuhan Institute of Virology as well as US scientists, filed a patent on Feb. 24 2020, according to documents obtained by theAustralian.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theaustralian.com.au/science/us-paid-chinese-peoples-liberation-army-to-engineer-coronavirus/news-story/4adee56c1433fad332a76ffe043390ea

The patent — lodged by the “Institute of Military Medicine, Academy of Military Sciences of the PLA” — was filed just five weeks after China admitted there was human-to-human transmission of the virus, and months before Zhou died under mysterious circumstances, the report noted.

“This is something we have never seen achieved before, raising the question of whether this work may have started much ­earlier,” Prof. Nikolai Petrovsky from Flinders University told the paper.

    <div class="md">Which specific actions? Please tell.

You can't answer my questions so you just respond with more vague insults and abuse. You've long since lost the argument but l am still interested in trying to piece together your logic. Does the little robot emoji mean you think l'm a bot now?

You've so far gone from... what? Being banned from r/COVID19_support for misinformation to accusing me of censoring you, claiming l'm a 'failure' and a 'fraud' as an academic because my thesis, which you wrongly think is somehow about controlling narratives but can't point out what part of it made you think that, is simultaneously a 'joke' yet also paid for by some kind of worldwide academic conspiracy to enable 'elite' nazi academics to control the world. You can't explain who exactly is funding this but still shriek about me being a failure even though l've worked at three of the world's top universities and one of its top think tanks and have a successful research programme. You then move to claiming that academia is somehow corrupt but you can't say exactly how, despite claiming you were going to research who is funding me and 'expose' conflicts of interest... which you haven't and can't do. My current research is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council - ESRC - and the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council - AHRC - both academic funding bodies, and the World Health Organisation. Where's the conflict of interest there? 

You then go on attempt  to make some ludicrous comparison with Monsanto (a company that, l presume you're unaware, doesn't even exist any more) and accuse me of racism when l say that the academia you accuse of being corrupt and funding Monsanto's research (which it didn't and certainly doesn't now because the company doesn't exist any more) has been highly critical of Monsanto's business practices. Do you think Monsanto is funding me, or academia in general? Who do you think is paying me to 'shill' for them? The ESRC? The AHRC? or WHO? And why? What are they trying to achieve? And if they have such nefarious plans for world dominance, why would they fund such a 'failed' academic? These are really questions that need answers if you expect your argument to have any credibility.

Please, do continue. This is really getting quite funny now.

p.s. The contraction of 'you are' is you're. With an apostrophe. It's really not that hard to get at least that part right.</div>

    <div class="md">Your a academic simp, and again my lackluster approach with you is because of that. You go after low hanging fruit by manufacturing a process in your rooms of influence and control to show a illusion of compliance and in theory will shape the choices of others, that if not influenced by your promoted side would or may have chosen differently. gtfoh with your wino 🍷rant. 🦜 Always parroting away are we. 😂</div>

    <div class="md">Do you feel guilty, hence your engagement or is it you need to vindicate yourself. I'm blushing with your attentive attention but honestly do we think it's quite funny that a PhD holder would even care, you may have a mental illness and its probably being spurred by that prion disease setting in like I said before, are they unfolding again?

Didn't think alchohol was good for that... 🍷</div>

    <div class="md">You are aware you are the bully, your an Academic bully. That uses titles and controlled environments to create the wanted reaction from your subjects. You pick out grammar issues rather than taking the time to understand another, you throw your title around as if that dictates respect. We are all strangers online, for all you know I can be a work colleague. 🤫

Your a Nazi, it's ok. Most are found out, most are in academics and you happen to be one of them which also happens to be a wino 🍷 that parrots 🦜 talking points and regurgitated material. 

Why should you feel guilt, never seen a nazi have guilt either. It was just a job after all, cops go to bed soundly just as much as academic murderers do. One uses a firearm to kill another uses published papers. No different, your still a pos simp with a candy PhD nothing significant will be remembered about work besides your racist pov.</div>

    <div class="md">Your the one trying, 🐒  smh... Look how far you fell from that ivory tower of yours, for what? Ego, trying to make a point to entertain strangers as a PhD holder.

Your a joke and your colleagues abhor your conversations. Your academic life work is following suit, just as your idiotic conclusion of your thesis. You contributed nothing in new knowledge, redundant #af Just a basic 🤖

https://rusi.org/people/cole

Defense industry think tanks are truly low hanging fruit for academics. 

Expert 😂

This is what the experts are wasting their free time with, reddit 🍖 another reason to show how covid-19 is all a scam the experts are all in on it because we see them on reddit defending their ego's over defeating the pandemic. 

🐒  with a PhD

Your a loser a simp and wino. Surround yourself with yes people and all you'll get is subpar leadership performance and your favorite place to be. Your echo chamber. 

Just a 🐍 in the grass.</div>

    <div class="md">To answer a possible follow up reply from you, nah I didn't read your post. Like I said your insignificant, more or less a toy. Please be satisfied you are satisfying me with your energy it's quite filling. 

You sincerely know nothing of history? Are you truly unable to mark and sight trends, so again your PhD earned how again, really earned... Can't be because of that shitty shitty 💩 thesis. All that you can contribute to society was that pos, stop drinking wine and do real research and study that isn't for the benefit of control. Your a tool, not complex however very rudimentary. 

A simp with a PhD is quite dangerous when you place them in the right environment which typically is a echo chamber self managed however, out here in the open space your nothing but another cow.

p.s 

I don't have to answer anything you inquire of me and vice versa, your a academic trying to pull a card on me 🤔😂 your nothing just another 6 figure 🐒 that will be forgotten in life and in academics your papers will continue being laughed at deep within the forums of reddit, 4chan and the rest. 

Your colleagues all circle jerk each other and you want me to take you serious, 💦</div>

Echo Chamber...

I can provide the title for the new owners of Monsanto which is Bayer, equally shitty. Nazi origin just like you. 

Monsanto will never be forgotten unless your an academic with a PhD in Global Health trying to white wash the past for a whiter future.

    <div class="md">Your dumb ass videos on youtube are amusing to see what a wasted space and shitty PhD thesis produces a subpar d6 nazi perspective driven academic. Guess you weren't alive for the beta test 1939 to 45 as an academic to push along the nazis. 

But your alive now  participating like a pos scholar accessory to the crime. No worries Nuremberg round 2 going to be. 🥳

Watch "Israeli Holocaust Survivor Vera Sharav and Dr. Reiner Fuellmich Talk 'Global Genocide'" 

on YouTube
https://youtu.be/PdlWhuUFuKs

Sure, your going to deny any involvement your a useful idiot nothing less nothing more. Useful still, hat tip to that. As we look back at your anaemic ass PhD thesis is 💩, I've seen freshmen think and produce better work over a weekend. Don't send me to the gulag now.

Is that gene therapy treatment already spreading, graphene oxide 🤔😂

Stupid fucking monkies, literally cyborg monkies for Gates and co. gimps and bdsm at heart I guess. 

Its unfortunate that they can't keep cryptocurrency at bay for longer cause we are going to have squirters that make it free and climb the ladder of chaos to elitism through coin, quite literally digital coin.

And no I'm not talking BTC or stupid DOGE, but the real utility ones. When the price discovery for those come, you know we going to have flipping retarded as people running around with lambos for every day of the week. 

Unstoppable people and mostly if not all will "happen" to  be people that have not taken the mRNA gene therapy treatment, what are we going to do with them?

They can pay every fine and pay any judge and lobby politicians to rewrite laws or at the very least cause a lot of problems to the monopoly of violence holder ie the gov. 

Then and then ONLy will the fucking plebeians see 2 legs are better than 4. And how they slaved and followed the rules and some shitbag with 10k on a coin is a billionaire. It's going to be glorious, for them. 👑

Oh' the piggies will squeal when they hear the  boar has been killed. 

In the contemporary case 2021 to 2030 

Oh' the boars will squeal when they hear the piggies have been killed.

    <div class="md">'you're different' you are. Honestly, that part really isn't difficult.

I've taken an interest in you making groundless claims about me and slinging childish insults at me, yes. What do you think is a blatant lie? Why do you think engaging like this might be interesting to me ... possibly because my academic research does cover the mechanisms of online communication and misinformation and, from that perspective, the way you engage is interesting. The petty insults, the attempts to doxx an identity l don't try to hide. I'm finding it quite amusing.</div>

I found similar complaints about this same moderator: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ReportTheBadModerator/comments/hy53pz/ujennifercolerhuk\_of\_rcovid19\_support\_banned\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReportTheBadModerator/comments/hy53pz/ujennifercolerhuk_of_rcovid19_support_banned_me/)

So it looks like she has, from the beginning of the pandemic, been biased against taking precautions for covid or concern over catching covid in specific ways that she thought was unreasonable.</div>

    <div class="md">Ya, I thought my case was bad. But then I read what she was writing to other people and it's 10x worse. 

There is absolutely nothing wrong with vaccinated people continuing to wear masks around unvaccinated people. Even the CDC says there is nothing wrong with it. The vaccines are not 100% effective and some people don't want a mild or moderate case of covid when it can be avoided; it's not even know if a mild case can result in long covid or other longer term issues. There could also be variants in the future that the vaccines are less effective against. 

There is so much unknown still about the virus, variants, and vaccines. We are learning as we go. There is 0 issue with people being cautious and it has NOTHING to do with health anxiety. In fact, I have read of **many** extremely smart, competent doctors doing this. I was just listening to a podcast with 2 ER doctors from NYU and they still wear masks in indoor public spaces, avoid restaurants, etc. and they are vaccinated. I can provide many many examples of people doing this, including infectious disease experts. It's a matter of choice. 

This mod is wrong and contradicts what the CDC says herself. It's all about her personal opinion and beliefs and doing what she can to spread that, while shutting down anyone that says anything different.</div>

    <div class="md">Nobody cares about what the CDC says.  People want to use the situation to judge others, and this is the fucking place where the hivemind gets to downvote opinions that are outside the popular alignment.  This pandemic has all been very confusing, but things are getting more and more clear every day.

I don't know that you got the virus from food delivery, from what I've read that seems impossible.  But it was not long ago that thinking the virus was made in a lab made you a fucking nutjob piece of shit anti-asian racist, and now it's pretty much accepted.  Who knows where we'll be by the time of the next election, or what will be socially acceptable to believe or profess?</div>

    <div class="md">Welcome to reddit. This place is a shithole and the only good places are subs where mods aren't complete power tripping morons or aren't paid to construct a narrative in the subreddit.

Just look at the mod lists and general vibe of the userbase before you participate in subs. They don't want debates or discussion that challenges what the mods are told to do, the sub only exists to influence and cultivate a narrative that all these people agree on something from a higher power and accepted it as true and that no one questions it, and if they do, their comment is removed and commenter banned. They don't want the lurker audience to have challenging opinions presented in front of them for them to make up their mind, mods just want the opinion of the subs designed narrative to be clear and present and other comments fawning over and agreeing 100% without question.</div>

    <div class="md">Yes, its true, and it is indeed frustrating. I'm not used to it. When I was in grad school we debated all the time about different topics in and out of class. It was considered to be completely normal. We were even encouraged to discuss limitations of research articles.

This cancel culture on reddit (and in today's society) is really obnoxious. 

The moderator told me to go "rant" in some other reddit group about my experience, so I did. Then she follows me here, leaves a comment trying to control the narrative HERE too. And then proceeds to tell me that I need therapy (see her comments below). Really unbelievable</div>

April, 2020

&gt;	Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed)


https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2004973

December, 2020

&gt;	But scientists have learned a lot this year about the coronavirus and how it's transmitted, and it turns out all that scrubbing and disinfecting might not be necessary.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/28/948936133/still-disinfecting-surfaces-it-might-not-be-worth-it

Flip flop

Scientists have been studying coronaviruses for at least 30 years. Why the flip flopping from April to December?  

They did the same with masks. 

Trust the science though. 

If you feel like you can catch Covid 19 from surfaces take precautions because they don’t know wtf they are taking about. 

You aren’t wrong to ask questions but maybe Reddit isn’t the place to do it. There’s a huge agenda here and if you do anything that is perceived as misinformation or disinformation or a conspiracy theory, whatever they feel good about calling you for daring to not believe, you’re gonna get banned. 

Good luck to you and I hope you get some peace through these trying times.</div>

    <div class="md">I was banned too. After being accused several times of having anxiety about COVID simply for choosing to wear masks based on the information I have seen from doctors in response to a post asking for support on their choice to wear a mask. 

There is a new mod who won’t allow for any discussion about the efficacy of the vaccines, seems to base her information strictly on the US vaccines, and thinks choosing to wear a mask to avoid mild or asymptomatic COVID is some sort of health anxiety. 

She is way out of line and I’m really disappointed that she is allowed to continue in her capacity as a mod. 

**For some people, COVID support means a reality check about their choices and the choices of people around them. Not allowing a dialogue based on facts is absolutely appalling to me.**

The post I replied to was someone going back to work in an office where coworkers aren’t all vaccinated. They, too, want to wear a mask to be on the safe side. **Medical doctors** have advised the same thing and stated they are making similar choices since **the vaccine isn’t intended to prevent getting COVID**; it **lowers** the risk and for **most** people should mean if they do get COVID it won’t be severe.  

Not wanting to get even mild COVID - especially for people with pre-existing conditions - is **not anxiety**.  As someone with genuine OCD who has discussed these same issues with experienced medical &amp; mental health professionals, I find this mod’s gaslighting every time someone posts anything grounded in any reality other than vaccines making everyone safe, utterly vile, potentially dangerous, and borderline bullying. 

I really hope the other mods recognize what she is doing and remove her as a mod so the sub can go back to what it used to be.</div>

She doesn’t even have any background in healthcare and she’s literally deleting comments and banning people for sharing the same info  Fauci most recently has. 

IMHO, that’s even worse than an anti-vaxxer and uses the same thought process as the deniers and Q nitwits.</div>

    <div class="md">Paid shill, PhD graduate mission gone rogue? 🤭 

Wouldn't be surprised to see her as a defendant one day for her manipulation of minors to take a novel gene therapy treatment behind their guardians back knowingly withholding information about said treatment by not informing the tech behind it to the minors. Not to mention frontal lobe isn't even fully formed. 

People shooting up treatments as if its random shit at a party. Don't care where it came from, people said it's cool so the person goes ahead without a care. Devilish when done in the medical scene plain stupid when done at a party. However usually dosen't lead to death while the other is Nuremberg 2.0 in the making.</div>

    <div class="md">Its possible that you can get COVID from surfaces in a specific scenario. e.g If someone coughs on their hands and touchs metal, wood, etc then COVID will survive, and jump on someone else when they touch that surface. That person can have left the area 6 hours ago and you come in and touch the table and then rub your nose or mouth. Boom you have covid on your body. Even though the other person is long gone from the room. So its not 100% impossible. Maybe its 95% unlikely but again, its not impossible. Otherwise why would NZ health organization ask people to sanitize surfaces? For those above scenarios. 

So OP's theory is possible if he went to a place that someone with COVID sat down, and then OP came in 6 hours later and touched the table, and then their nose or mouth and then washed their hands (By then its too late, the virus is on their face, and may have been absorbed or breathed into their nose or mouth.

From NZ government own Health website 

https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-health-advice-public/about-covid-19/covid-19-questions-and-answers

How long can COVID-19 remain on surfaces?

COVID-19 is spread by droplets and contact with surfaces that infectious droplets have landed on. This means that when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, they may generate droplets containing the virus. These droplets are too large to stay in the air for long, so they quickly settle on surrounding surfaces.

COVID-19 can survive on different surfaces for different lengths of time. This is dependent on the surface, temperature and humidity. Further information on how long the COVID-19 virus can survive for can be found on the WHO website. 

People need to continue to regularly clean frequently touched surfaces and objects and wash hands. If you are using disinfectant, follow the instructions for use and check whether you need to wear gloves. Remember to wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dry thoroughly after cleaning and disinfecting.</div>

    <div class="md">Hi, the moderator of r/COVID19_support here to give a more balanced view of what happened. 

While it's easy to see yourself as right and everyone else as wrong, the overwhelming evidence is that surface transmission with COVID19 does not happen. This is consistent across not only the CDC but the WHO, NHS, every scientific journal and literally every scientific source. There is no clinically proven case of COVID19 that has happened due to surface transmission from groceries/door handles/mail etc. That is scientific fact. 

[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4)

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html)

[https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-important-are-surfaces-transmission-covid-19](https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/how-important-are-surfaces-transmission-covid-19)

.... and a thousand more will confirm this. 

r/COVID19_support is a subreddit for people who are struggling with the pandemic and who often have quite severe OCD and health anxiety. At present, many are struggling with restrictions being relaxed after a year of taking much more stringent precautions that most people around them and often more than are recommended by any public health agency. It is important to take this into consideration when discussing what we do or not allow or remove from the sub. 

You were not banned for criticising the CDC, you were banned for posting an anecdote of an extreme reaction that is contrary to both the common experience of most people and unsupported by science. This is not to say you don't believe it to be true, nor even to say that it isn't true but just as it would not be appropriate to post a comment saying "Yes but look at x plane crash that happened!" on a subreddit for people who are trying to overcome their fear of flying, or a post saying "yes, but my aunt tripped off the curb and was hit by a truck" on a subreddit for people trying to deal with agrophobia, it is not appropriate to post suggesting that surface transmission is likely. 

Your post was removed, as per the removal reason you were given, as not containing a reliable source. If you have a reliable source that points towards all the latest scientific research confirming that surface transmission is an issue, you are welcome to edit it into your removed post and will be reinstated. Just saying "all the scientists in the world agree but they're wrong because I say so" is not acceptable. 

Sorry we prefer the opinion of scientific experts on our sub to "people who think for themselves".</div>

    <div class="md">You are proving through this comment that you are nothing more than controlling reddit police. I don't care who you are in real life, but your life revolves around censoring people and banning them if you don't like what they say. This level of censorship is **wrong.** You spend your time policing people to ensure that everything fits your own narrative. I actually think that is dangerous.

Someone posted a link in the covid support group about covid on surfaces, and I responded to it. The original post wasn't about someone talking about their fears or concerns. It was literally just an article. And some of the responses to it were from people that said they were cutting corners at work and not sanitizing their grocery store or that thy will stop sanitizing and cleaning, even if it is required by their place of work. And you had no problems with those comments. Just MY comment, which was respectful and suggested something different - AND got 4 upvotes.

Every article that I have read says that it **absolutely is possible to catch covid from a surface; maybe less likely, but possible.** My own doctor and contact tracer told me that it was possible that I caught covid from a surface. And then I get banned by some moderator on Reddit for stating an "anecdote" that you didn't like. Most of what people post are "anecdotes" - so maybe just ban....everyone?

Also, my thought that what if asymptomatically or mildly infected people may have been infected from a surface (received a viral load) isn't some crazy conspiracy theory; it's plausible. Just has not been studied. But oooh how DARE I mention a hypothesis!

You must have been banning people who, early last year, suggested that masks could be beneficial. The CDC has flip flopped on **nearly everything** so it was actually the people that questioned them that turned out to be correct. And there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with bringing up opinions that may or may not fully align with what has been published about a still **relatively new** virus where were are still **learning about it.**

You also responded to someone's comment saying that **"nobody, ever"** told anyone to disinfect their keys or phone or personal items. WRONG. We were told to do that for months and months by top experts. What you said is your *personal opinion*, not facts. So you should ban yourself from the community. You are highly highly biased so your claim that you are some neutral party in this is absolutely wrong. You, from the beginning, have been against sanitizing surfaces and taking certain precautions.

Fine - go live in your echo chamber where you get to dictate every thing that is said and to control everything. You are contributing nothing positive to our society. This is not normal or healthy.</div>

You are gaslighting me and making it seem as if there is something wrong with me, when I actually have a right to be frustrated.

Any normal person would be upset about getting banned from a community by a controlling moderator who was banning people left and right to ensure that the comments fit with their narrative. I didn't post anything offensive or even factually incorrect. You just didn't like what I said due to your own biases, and deleted my comments.

Then when I go to a different group and discuss what happened, you follow me and try to control the narrative here too!!

And now you are telling me that I need to see a therapist?? What?? I have every right to be annoyed.

Can you just leave me alone? It is incredibly sick to go around telling people to go seek therapy when you don't even know them.</div>

You posted a highly subjective anecdote  on a subreddit for people struggling with health anxiety that grossly over exaggerated the risk from surface transmission. It was removed because it wasn't appropriate for the subreddit. If you want to whinge about being 'censored' at least understand what you were 'censored' for, which was not - as you wrongly assumed - criticising the CDC.</div>

    <div class="md">Nobody misrepresented anything. 

And no you don't have the right to go around following people online in order to defend yourself. There is no record to set straight - I told it like it is. You don't like that someone is complaining about you, and now you are trying to make yourself look good.

a) 90% of the comments and posts on /r/covid19_support are anecdotes

b) The comment with my anecdote got 4 upvotes, so everyone was cool with it and many people even liked it and agreed with it

c) I had another comment that you also deleted that did not have any anecdotes, just my questioning the CDC on transmission through surfaces. You deleted that one right away too. 

d) The reason you deleted my comments:  "Your post has been removed as your information does not link to a reliable source and therefore may not be accurate"

e) This is no reason to ban anyone

You spend way too much of your time scrolling through and reading everyone's comments and deleting the ones that you don't like. 

And no you don't have the "right" to do anything any more than I have a "right" to post in /r/covid19_support. Hopefully the moderator of this group can ban you.</div>

    <div class="md">Banned from r/censored - that would be ironic. 

I'm sorry it upset you to have inappropriate comments removed. I'm glad you have a place where you can vent your disappointment.

I hope you can reflect on the experience and realise that one unverified anecdote (you say yourself that none of your healthcare providers knew where you contracted COVID19 - you do not know it was surface transmission) on a subreddit for people who have health anxiety and are struggling to exit pandemic restrictions and feel safe is not helpful.

I hope you realise that if you misrepresent people behind their back they have a right to reply. And will continue to reply as long as you continue to misrepresent the situation.

You got removed and banned. You didn't like it. I think we've all got that now.</div>

    <div class="md">My comments were NOT inappropriate in any way. My initial comment received 4 upvotes. This had nothing to with that.

You have biases that are obvious from your comment history that you are very much AGAINST sanitizing surfaces. You go so far as to tell people that its basically stupid to disinfect things. That is your narrative. And if anyone challenges that, you censor them. 

90%+ of everything in that subgroup and on reddit is anecdotes and people discuss all kinds of things in that subreddit. Nobody had any issue with what I wrote. And as someone that has anxiety MYSELF, I can tell you there is not only absolutely NOTHING wrong with discussing things, it's normal and HELPFUL to people. You don't put people with anxiety in a bubble and block out the world. What if someone with anxiety posted about how they were anxious about x, y, and z and you didn't like it or claimed it made people more anxious? Like come on lady!! You are just being the reddit police. 

That particular post was also just a link to an article, not someone complaining about being anxious. 

And your own comment history proves that you don't actually care about anyone's "anxiety" or being supportive. You just have your own beliefs and its all about spreading them and censoring anyone that disagrees.

**Nobody is misrepresenting you. You proved YOURSELF with your responses that you are delusional. My initial post was about how your extreme censorship and policing was wrong. But you have gone out of your way to make things up, try to spin this in your favor, try to twist everything. And you won't stop. You do not know how to leave people alone. And everything is about YOUR "rights" to say what you want, but ironically you block people and ban them for saying what THEY want. Because its all about you.** 

I hope that YOU can reflect on your behavior, but I know in reality that you can't. Your behavior is so outrageous and you are so condescending that there may be no hope for you. 

And I don't care that I got banned by an obnoxious moderator. I just think that on a global scale, moderators like you are toxic and dangerous to society because you only allow people to hear what you want and censor everything you don't like.</div>

    <div class="md">And YOU posted, in response to someone asking if they should disinfect their phone or keys:

 "No, and you never needed to be doing this in the first place. It was never recommended by anyone."

Except, they have.

And I can give you more examples.

So when are you going to ban yourself from the group for stating something completely false?

And another guy on the thread said he worked in a grocery store and didn't wipe anything down as required because he didn't see the need to do that. And his comment is still up, even though he was describing a disregard for public health laws and protocols.

All of this points to you and your biases. You don't want anyone to mention covid spreading through surfaces. You don't want anyone wiping things down. You allow anecdotes when they support your narrative. And you want your point of view to shine through.</div>

You can find blogs that say the Earth is flat if you look hard enough for them.

WHO, CDC, NHS, Public Health England etc have never recommended that level of surface cleaning, it has never been indicated as a major route of transmission.

The blog post is also from a year ago and the current discussions on r/COVID19_support have been generated by more recent studies that have confirmed this behaviour is unnecessary.

A major role of the sub is de-validating the extreme behaviours of people with health anxiety and helping them to understand they're not necessary.</div>

    <div class="md">Stop, just stop. Enough already. Your censorship and policing is obnoxious. My comment got 4 upvotes. I'm allowed to question surface transmission. People talk about all kinds of things in that Reddit group and question things all the time.

You just don't like the idea of surface transmission and you are biased. It's obvious. I read through your other comments. You just get rid of things you don't like.

Stop policing people and leave them alone. 

Heck, I probably have more freedom to say what I want in an actual therapy group. But on reddit you police the heck out of everything.
And you act like oh this is a support group, I'm just trying to protect people. Ha! That's hilarious. I've seen your responses to other people. You are far from supportive. And most of the comments are all over the place in terms of support.

Even so, to delete and ban people for posting respectful comments and questioning absolutely normal things is...crazy. People can discuss things in a support group. It's normal. Nobody flagged my comments and nobody responded saying anything negative 

You even told me that you were removing my comments because they were not "accurate" and now are trying to spin this differently.

Bottom line: your extreme censorship is wrong. You are doing what you can to push your narrative and therefore you are keeping posts you like and deleting what you don't like. This is all about you and your biases. You love to ban people left and right, it's clearly your hobby.

And the fact that you keep trying to get the last word and trying to defend yourself... it just shows you are desperate</div>

THERE IS CONFLICTING INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET

&gt;	Different Kinds of Surfaces
It’s unlikely to catch COVID-19 from a surface, **but the risk still exists**. Lab studies have found that the virus may last on different materials for varying amounts of time. We don’t know if these findings always apply in the real world, but we can use them as a guideline.

I find it incredibly disturbing that you would follow people around on Reddit trying to get the last word. I believe you have good intentions but you come across as someone who thinks we’re all just a bunch of morons and it’s your job to belittle us until we agree with you. 

You’re a well educated doctor who has a bunch of fancy titles and all but I didn’t see anything about you that mentions psychology and mental health issues. I know you’re a doctor and all but should you be giving mental health advice based on just a few posts in a forum?  Of course not. You are just belittling people because you think you’re better than them. It’s not a good look. 

Perhaps you should head on back to your little safe space and chat with your little followers and enjoy your little accolades. 

Us buck toothed hillbilly uneducated folks ‘round here know that science is ever changing and it’s never “settled”. We have the right to research and ask questions without feeling like we’re stupid.</div>

    <div class="md">And you can go around misrepresenting what l said for as long as you like but removing misinformation and pointing out where people are misrepresenting me is not 'belittling' them. 

You're correct that a support sub is a safe space for its users - but please don't belittle yourself by putting abusive terms such as 'buck toothed hillbilly' into my mouth. If that's how you think other people see you l'm sorry for you but it is not a term l would ever use about anyone.

For what it's worth, it's a term that would get you banned on my sub. Or 'censored'. Whatever you want to call it.

"Yes, the virus lives on surfaces – door handles, countertops, clothing, furniture and much more. How long the virus survives on a given surface varies from hours to days, depending on numerous factors.  
Yes, you can become infected with the virus after touching a contaminated surface."

The reason that it is noted that this method of transmission is low is due to **frequent hand washing**, so experts are saying it is unlikely to be transmitted this way because people are sanitizing and hand washing, not because it isn't possible. 

So when we all go back to normal and people stop sanitizing and stop washing and stop wearing masks, the incidences of surface transmission may increase. 

But anyway, experts agree that it is possible to get covid from a surface.</div>

    <div class="md">From the very blog you list above:

"But no, it’s not likely you would get sick that way – especially if you diligently practice good hand hygiene."

"“This is a respiratory virus. It mainly attacks your respiratory system, so it needs to have contact with a mucus membrane, such as in your nose, mouth or eyes,” Lori said.  
In other words, simply touching a contaminated surface will not make you sick. The problem starts when you use unwashed or unsanitized hands to eat or scratch your nose or rub your eyes."

"But we should not worry about everything we touch on a trip to the store. We don’t need to wipe down every pizza box or postal package we bring into our home.  
“The likelihood of picking up coronavirus from a cardboard package is very slim. It’s been shown the virus can survive 24 hours on cardboard, but that doesn’t mean it’s present in a level where it will cause infection,” Lori said. “Just wash your hands after you handle the package."

"Even then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that such contact is not believed to be the main way the virus spreads."

    <div class="md">It's NOT LIKELY, but not impossible. And **especially if you diligently practice good hand hygiene**, which NOT EVERYONE DOES. 

I am not an idiot and I know that you have to touch your eyes or mouth or nose after touching a contaminated surface. 

The entirety of the article assumes that you won't touch your face without washing your hands!!! 

And yes the **CDC says they don't believe its the main way that it spreads. So what? They never said that it doesn't spread that way.** And the CDC doesn't know about where the thousands and thousands of asymptomatic infections came from either. They are basing this off of what they know, not what they don't know.

Every doctor I talked to after my positive test result told me that it was possible I got infected from a surface. You need to stop harassing people. We still don't know everything about this virus, and experts say that it is in fact possible to get it from a surface, just like with other respiratory infections. 

You are wrong that surface transmission is impossible. Admit that you are wrong, and move on.</div>

That's what you posted here about - claiming you were censored for criticising the CDC. That's not why your post was removed.

    <div class="md">I dare you to stop washing your hands and stop using hand sanitizer...because according to you...**you can't get covid from surfaces!!** Stop washing your hands asap. Stop using hand sanitizer asap. Freely touch your face. You don't need to worry. 

Please, go ahead with the above. Would love to witness it in action and see proof that you are going about your day without doing any of these things and rubbing your eyes and mouth.

And you won't get covid, right?? It's impossible to get if from a surface, according to **you.**</div>

    <div class="md">Most people don't consistently wash their hands after every time that they touch something. Go observe people in any store and you still see plenty of them rubbing their eyes or nose. And I'm taking about adults here. We all know kids are constantly touching their face. 

If people were always so perfect with their hygiene very few people would ever get sick. That's not the reality.</div>

    <div class="md">You claim to care about OPs well being but you still feel the need to be “right”. The so called truth about coronavirus changes by the hour and I’ve seen many times where the CDC gets things wrong. 

OP isn’t giving out disinformation, but merely seeking assistance and help. 

Perhaps instead of trying so hard to be right, you should keep an open mind to what people are afraid of and try to be more compassionate.</div>

The OP was giving out misinformation (disinformation is given out maliciously, misinformation is incorrect but shared in the belief it is true) and that's why their post was removed - not, as they state, because they were censored for criticising the CDC. 

Their initial post here is giving a false picture, which l have every right to correct.</div>

    <div class="md">Thanks for your comment.

This moderator is nuts. She won't leave me alone and will not stop harassing me and posting in this thread, even when asked to stop. She ironically bans people left and right but then thinks she has all the rights in the world to say whatever she wants wherever she wants.

She is also lying and trying to spin all of this in her favor, saying whatever she can to "defend" her banning me and others. Now she is trying to make this about policing what she thinks is too "anxiety provoking" for people to post in the other subgroup when in fact all of this is based on her own biases and narrative and what she personally agrees or disagrees with. 

Not only that, but telling me that she hopes I can learn a lesson from someone standing up to me. SMH. This woman is nuts and the more she talks, the more I'm convinced of it. She is also condescending and rude. Someone like her should be the last one to moderate any type of "support group".

Anyway, thanks for the support and for taking the time to stand up to this moderator.</div>

    <div class="md">You pulled the same thing on me for stating that the vaccine isn’t 100% effective and people can still get mild or a symptomatic cases. 

You tried to gaslight me by saying I have medical anxiety for **not wanting to get COVID** - mild or otherwise - and therefore **choosing to continue wearing a mask indoors around people who aren’t vaccinated** in response to a post by someone asking for validation for their choice to do the same thing since they have to go back to their office job and and spend full work days in an unventilated space shared with unvaccinated people. 

You are a way out of your element and it’s absolutely appalling that the other mods are letting you continue to use your, frankly piss-poor, armchair psychology to shut down every single comment that suggests continuing to be cautious when in indoor, public spaces (guidance that *Fauci* himself has said he is taking) by accusing people of having a mental health issue.</div>

    <div class="md">Have you ever got services for a child for autism in the uk?

The NHS will pay out once a diagnosis is made, being aware and intimately informed of the practices of the NHS to get a diagnosis is as hard as a healthy young adult dying from covid-19 is.

The NHS is ages behind in treatment compared to other developed countries like the one across the pond is. Honestly it might be the influence of medical academics producing fraudulent studies and denying the treatments done elsewhere over those they prefer, wonder if it happens to be because of funding and spending influence. 

They don't deny it, but yet the NHS fights the facts just like you do in your covid-19 rooms of manipulation.</div>

    <div class="md">That's your opinion not the fact. Sorry it's a fact, just as much as minors and young adults not needing the covid-19 gene therapy treatment as the disease is well beneath the threshold for any benefit from this invasive treatment. The documented problems received outweigh the disease itself to the individuals in question. Ethics anyone, don't hold your breath with academics or Dr's remember Nuremberg, the nazis pressed as long as they did because of Academics and Dr's alone. That was the foundation, but relied to much on military coercion, learned from their mistakes I see. 

This twat is nothing more than a cog in the machine, don't even know she being played. 

just saying the fact.</div>

    <div class="md">Nazis did well in dividing people into categories so much its persisting today with this academic nazi.

Labeling those that inquire and debate science as a apparent antivaxer. Pretty low hanging fruit here, always aiming lower when we thought you couldn't. 

Most people engage and debate, you ban and label people. Real trustworthy, honestly its quite the opposite. You still just a 🐍in the grass.

Time is ticking and time is not on your side, 2022 and all. The game is up and I commend your valiant effort to coerce and manipulate malleable minds many being just minors. 

Unfortunately not those informed that took the time to research the information while following the money trail and noticing the stake holders involved. smh...

Nuremberg 2.0 incoming

At the end of all this, I'll commemorate you with a NFT of your idiotic engagements on defending your gray area tactics of manipulating minors and uneducated masses. smh.. low hanging fruit smh..</div>

    <div class="md">Where on earth did I get that from, do a simple search simp, or have experience. 🤷🏿‍♂️ seems to be plenty of forums about this problem.

Not to mention didn't they place in DNR's on them as well, during the start of this covid-19 scamdemic, pretty scandalous imo. nazis being nazis eugenics round 2, will we have Nuremberg 2.0 will you be a defendant only time will tell.

Also going over your comments...

Manipulation of minors with out guardianship present to push a experimental gene therapy authorized under emergency clause. No sane educated person would accept it they would pay what ever added expense to refuse it until enough time has passed or new laws created to protect from what was done with this scamdemic. 

ONLY the poor  or poorly informed are FORCED financially or by underhanded manipulation tactics of rudimentary framing for a expected outcome thru raw staging while the others take it due to financial needs of  being excluded by all the markets leaves them where? Rational will tell a basic man that this displays the reality, those with financial means can still have a choice by if one chooses can pay the extra expenses to deny any restriction of ones sovereignty unlike a slave would. Just saying 🤷🏿‍♂️ 

Not saying if you want to recieve it so be it go to town, but to exclude a person from society? They don't have Leprosy acting as if we dont trust the experimental gene therapy shot to offer the protection it states. Jeeze have some faith and live life, pos simps have taken over. really PhD freaks think they run online talk forums, fuck this twat.

Academic medical slaver is you, and a bad one at that, the point was to change peoples ideas and opinion not furthur entrench them. Guess it only works on those malleable minds. Low hanging fruit imo.

Minors can't give consent, unless your one of them people. Nonce, stick with the adults you should read through your comments. You manipulate minors.

Wonder if the parents would be happy after we provide them your public details?

I'll bring up your bullshit as PhD everytime as its bullshit. Added nothing to academia its fluff, your a academic fluffer. 💦🚀</div>
