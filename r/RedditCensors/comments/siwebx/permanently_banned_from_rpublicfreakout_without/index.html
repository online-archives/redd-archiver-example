&gt;This poor man just wanted to sleep, I've been pushed like this by housemates and I can honestly say it's maddening. Not oh I'm angry Maddening but I'm going to go insane if I can't sleep one more day maddening.

Just wait until you hear motorcycles and they don't deliver your goods around like these truckers.

Someone replied with:

&gt;These truckers are not delivering goods around.

I replied to them:

&gt;They were until they were protesting vaccine mandates.

I posted this to the thread:

https://np.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/sie642/freedom_truckers_have_been_honking_their_horns/hvaxd5w/?context=3

&gt;ITT: pro-worker anti-authoritarian protests are so loud and inconvenient.

    <div class="md">&gt;You post shitty far-left propaganda all day. Most of it blatantly wrong.

Incorrect.

&gt;You’re the least credible person to be saying that

Posts to the majority report, howard stern and neoliberal. 

Says shit like:

"You’re stereotypical of the type of people that follow Krystal and Saagar. The common theme being nasty aggressive partisans from MAGA world and Bernie Brodom who differ on policy but share a vitriolic temperament." 

And:

"For someone who reacts to a linked WaPo article with derision it’s not lost on me the irony you’re linking to literal state propaganda channel Russia Today as if it’s credible."

As if MSM in America isn't essentially state TV lol

And defending YouTube removing dislikes:

"There’s a big difference between downvoting clickbait videos or a technical video that is incorrect vs pulling up a news video of a politician and it’s got more downvotes than votes and all the politician said in the video was “God bless America.” It becomes obvious the videos are being downvoted by people that simply don’t like the subject (in this case a politician) rather than an honest judgement on the content of video itself. Worse, it’s not a 1:1 ratio of person to downvote. Bots and fake accounts spam the dislikes to artificially inflate them. This has been a problem for years and I’m actually glad it’s been done away with. There’s a reason out of all the social media platforms only Reddit uses downvotes. It’s usually toxic."

And saying stuff like this:

"I’m very familiar with January 6th. There is no coverup or framing. This is typical right-wing conspiracy nonsense in an attempt to shirk responsibility for what conservatives did that day. Even if there were FBI agents working up the crowd nobody made Trump supporters break in the Capitol and commit various illegal acts. If anything, you’re admitting conservatives are easily duped which isn’t very flattering to say the least."

And linking propaganda out WaPo.

I think you are hardly one to talk and you only think I'm 'far-left' because you probably aren't even a leftist.</div>

    <div class="md">Only for idiots it is. I’m among the majority of Americans and world citizens for that matter that are neither far-left nor far-right. I see myself as center-left. But I’m a capitalist and socialism is a failed system that’s never worked and will never work. I don’t consider people that try to resurrect habitually failed ideologies as particularly bright. Also, there exists on the fringe of the far-left the same kind of authoritarianism that’s on the far-right as well as a love of authoritarian regimes. This is why you will see pro-Putin or pro-Russia rhetoric/beliefs from both extremes. 

You have to be a certain kind of stupid to think a thoroughly corrupt kleptocratic dictatorship that’s institutionalized thuggery is the victim and the West is the menace. Their logic is as painfully simple as saying because the West does bad things they’re no better or perhaps even worse than obvious autocratic states. It’s like saying someone who gets a DUI is the same as a rapist or murderer because both have broken laws or done wrong. It’s this kind of warped logic and lack of reason that drives both the far-left &amp; far-right.</div>

    <div class="md">The horseshoe theory is a BS talking point pushed by neolibs and neocons. It discredits people on both sides with common class issues as the extremes and fringe, when the extremists are in fact the ones in the middle who reject popular policy and that goes for leadership of both parties btw. The whole red-brown alliance and pipeline* talking points for instance is neolib propaganda you see pushed by pro-corp dem, pro-war/imperilism, pro-censorship dems.</div>

    <div class="md">You discredit yourself by cramming as many meaningless far-left buzzwords into sentences as possible. You clearly don’t realize to the majority of people, those words mean nothing. In fact, they sound ridiculous. But to people who know the far-left, they realize they’re little more than sloppy vague insults that basically amount to “you’re stupid and I don’t like you.” To claim the real extremists are people in the middle and not the people on each extreme is HILARIOUS and defies basic logic (again). 

Tell me, are you going to convince someone like me in the middle that socialized medicine is superior before someone on the far-right who thinks anything with social in it, even social dinner parties, is the work of the Soros devil? Of course you’re going to convince someone in the middle before someone that wants pure regressive capitalism and thinks anyone wanting to tax the rich is just jealous. I actually have been for universal healthcare for years and so have the majority of democrats. But go on and tell me how the far-right is more understanding and less extreme than moderates 😂. 

And to that point, I’m sure the far-left will be on board quicker than the middle with the far-right’s brilliant solution to the healthcare crisis— less government and more boutique cash only medical offices 😂</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;You discredit yourself by cramming as many meaningless far-left buzzwords into sentences as possible.

Yawn. Haven't heard that one before. You are projecting. You think I'm far-left when I am just regular anti-establishment anti-war/imperialism leftist and in most European countries, I would be center center-left, as you claim to be. You seem to be further right than you think and actually part of the extreme and minority.</div>
