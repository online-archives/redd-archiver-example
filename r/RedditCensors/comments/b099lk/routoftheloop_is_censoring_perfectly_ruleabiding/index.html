&gt;We don't allow links to other subreddits

I'm super confused so I've replied in the hopes of having that confusion cleared up:

&gt;Thank you for the reply. I'm confused by your answer as it doesn't really follow what is actually happening in the subreddit. Firstly, nothing in your rules mentions anything about not being allowed to link to another subreddit. Also, here's a post right now from your subreddit where the original post itself has a link to another subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/b0btkq/whats_up_with_kurzgesagt_and_being_trusted/

&gt;How can you say the reason for removal was because I linked to another subreddit when it's clear by your actions in the subreddit itself, and by your rules in the sidebar, that you definitely do allow links to other subreddits?

~end of edit~

I messaged the mods the morning after my initial comment was removed. I messaged them twelve hours later, then I messaged them again twelve hours after that with the below message. I'm really not sure what else to do at this point other than keep waiting twelve hours, then message again. As a reminder, Reddit  states:

&gt;Offer helpful rule explanations, tips, and links to new or confused users.

I am definitely a confused user. 

&gt;Try to respond to all of your moderator mail, even if you cannot address it in a timely manner.

Below is my latest message that I sent this morning:

I made a comment two days ago now that was removed. I was incredibly careful to abide by the rules, so I'm confused on why my comment was removed. Here is the URL to the comment.

https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/azebvo/whats_up_with_mods_removing_comments_without_any/ei89kb4/

I've messaged the mods twice now, this being the third time, trying to get an answer on what's going on here.

This morning I left another comment, this time even more careful, and now it too has been removed. Here is the comment:

https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/b06ahq/whats_going_on_with_gallowboob/eick644/

Please reply to my message and let me know why both of these comments were removed. They must have broken a rule, but I've utterly lost as to which rule(s) they broke. Thank you.

Edit:

I have messaged again in an attempt to get a reply. I don't know what else to do but wait a reasonable amount of time then message again. Here is my latest message:

Good evening,

This is now the fourth message I've sent attempting to get a reply on why my two of my comments have been removed. Please reply when you get a moment. Thank you. Here is my original message:
