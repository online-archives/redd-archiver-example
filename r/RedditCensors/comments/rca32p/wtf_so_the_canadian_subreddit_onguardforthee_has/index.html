    <div class="md">OP has no idea what a Hijab is. It is not a religious garment or exclusive to muslims and neither is it oppressive. It's clothing women wear for cultural modesty and empowerement.

The teacher who was fired for refusing to take off her hijab has had her rights abused by the school.

And the mods decision to *temporarily* ban was a good call and quite tolerant.</div>

Your ignorance is bleeding out all over the place.

You might want to talk to the women living in Islamic countries about that one. Because they are fighting - and _dying!_ - for the right to _not_ wear one.

They are being _forced_ by the _religious authorities_ to wear the hijab _on penalty of death_ because it is a part of the religious edicts, as a religious tool for the suppression and brutalization of women.

Links get a post automodded, but there are plenty of news articles out of places like Iran where women are pulled off the street with dog catcher's tools and beaten like animals just because they refuse to wear the hijab.</div>
