      <div class="md">Another sub that doesn't realize [I have been posting there regularly for 1-2 years](https://www.reddit.com/r/outrun/search?q=author%3Akarmagheden&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) (because I like to share good content I come across to relevant subs) and then a mod calls me a karma farmer in a recent post thread (which ignores users with 5/10/20/30+ million karma and embraces prejudice - what happened to moddiquette?) and then perma bans me. I didn't even see their comment in the thread until after I got the mod message about being banned and was searching for a reason as to why I got this ban. Oh and this same mod wrote to me an hour before saying no problem, that I could repost the picture (I already had at that point) as it was removed when I mistakenly posted it on music monday, so double WTF. I guess once you get past a certain amount of karma and combine that with bogus reports, you may find yourself in this situation. What a waste of time contributing just to be banned over nothing.

Pretty much this is how it goes and it's happened a bunch of times now: I post to a sub that I post to frequently, someone in the comment section says something about me (e.g. that I stole the post when I just used the share function and credited the source if I knew it/knew it was OC) and it gets upvoted, a mod goes: you know what, wow yeah look at their karma or where they post, what they post about politically, they must be a troll or karma farmer. Then the mod bans me. Or I message mods over a post/comment removal because I am curious why it was removed (let's say they actually reply and don't ignore my inquiry) and they either defend automod instantly removing my comment (because a word/phrase triggered automod algorithm) or defend it's removal later by a mod despite the post or comment not violating the rules. They will not listen to any counter argument or appeal and will just end up banning and muting you. I'm going to guess it's not all mod abuse but partly due/enabled by users commenting and reporting with the goal to get content removed and users banned. 

To those reading this: maybe you can't relate or don't like people who have a lot of karma or who post reposts w/e (despite probably the vast majority of stuff on social media being reposted from somewhere else) but I'd like to think you can see why it's still fucked up to just ban people contributing in good faith because you think they are just karma farming. You can look me up on redditmetis (replaced snoopsnoo) and see how much I comment on reddit. See how much karma I get per comment. If only it showed how many sources I have provided. If you want karma farmers, see people who are actually paid to do just that to sell accounts. Calling someone a karma farmer is pretty much derogatory and akin to calling someone a bad faith/for hire user or a bot. Yes, it's offensive to people who post for free and care more about sharing, posting quality content and having discussion, above karma. If someone just cared about karma, why the fuck would they spend so much time posting controversial shit and posts to places where they don't expect will get many votes? Why would someone do this if they just wanted to farm karma??

 Yeah and I expect this post to be controversial, even here, but it's still such a shitty move on the mods part and a slap in the face to users who contribute and participate to communities in good faith.</div>

    <div class="md">What is funny? I post regularly, it is a hobby. Do you know there are a ton of users with more karma than me, right? Do you think all of them are being paid and or have no life outside of Reddit? Hell, the head of the imaginary network sub has 16 million karma and says they only post between 1-2 hours per day in the morning while watching Youtube videos and drinking coffee. It is not terribly hard to collect karma these days.
