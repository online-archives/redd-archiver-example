    <div class="md">I love that the mod said:

&gt;but even the comments that were nice were getting reported over and over for bullshit reasons. If I didn’t nuke the thread, I would have had to lock all the comments anyways

What does that have to do with anything??? Hello?? You're telling us that people were reporting them for wrong reasons. Wouldn't the whole point be to not remove the comments, if the reports were wrong? You've contradicted yourself and proved how insanely ignorant you are, all while trying too hard to seem like the good guy. I hate this platform so much.</div>
