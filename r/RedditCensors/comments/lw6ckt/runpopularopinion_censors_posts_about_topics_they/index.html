here is my OP, un-edited:  [what - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/TPL1bOs)

here is a conversation i had with one of the mods:  [irony - Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/rU3BdqM)

I do agree that the title of my post is wrong, Tom &amp; Jerry did portray some racist scenes, as light hearted as these scenes are, they're still racist, but my point was that it wasn't actively tyring to teach kids "black man bad white man good", i should've called it "***Tom and Jerry don't teach kids racism***" instead</div>
