    <div class="md">The evidence of censorship lies not only in what was removed, but what was allowed to stay. Removing something because it is in violation of subreddit rules is simply rules enforcement. Take, for example, /r/The_Donald removing many anti Trump posts. They literally have a rule that clearly states that any talk of Trump in a negative light is not allowed. Hence how what they're doing isn't censorship. 

So if, as another example, /r/news or /r/worldnews made a rule that stated that any post that didn't follow the Liberal agenda was not allowed then the censorship on those subreddit would not be censorship, it'd simply be rules enforcement.

The issue here with /r/NoStupidQuestions is that they can't claim any of this was simply rules enforcement since they only removed posts that echoed Conservative sentiments and readily allowed super biased, super Liberal, super opinionated, fact-lacking posts. That's not rules enforcement. It's selective removal to forward an agenda behind the mask of fairness. That's censorship. </div>

They're not, they're just expected to not only get the ones that are Conservative views.

Because they're only removing Conservative comments. </div>
