    <div class="md">I'm physically in pain. 

Imagine if the event were about the best speedrunners, not about pushing an idea that "LOOK HOW NORMAL BEING TRANS IS. EVERYONE IS TRANS WOW!" This is absolutely disgusting and these people need serious help. Any "support" should be in the form of advising them to see a medical professional as you would advise anyone with a mental disorder. Why we've chosen this particular mental disorder and decided that urging someone to get it treated is somehow "bigoted" is beyond me.</div>

    <div class="md">It isn't. Every forum on this website where my opinion is discussed is met with cries of "BIGOT!" If the norm was "Oh yeah they're medically diagnosed and treated" then no one would react when someone made such a suggestion.

I've heard a lot of different issue people have with trans people, but this is such a strange one.

    <div class="md">Uh, no it doesn't.

[There are many examples of regretting their transition.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/16/transition-caused-more-problems-than-it-solved). 

[Another one.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/02/11/transgender-debate-transitioning-sex-gender-column/1894076002/)

[30 more examples.](https://thefederalist.com/2019/01/03/30-transgender-regretters-come-closet-new-book/)

Most people with gender dysphoria have a multitude of underlying psychological problems that are either left untreated or worsened thanks to transition "treatment". Why do you think the suicide rate for these people doesnt change from before and after transitioning?</div>

    <div class="md">Individuals having additional issues aside from gender dysphoria is not relevant to the effectiveness of transitioning on gender dysphoria. 

Instead of emotional pieces about individual cases, how about looking at the statistics from dozens of studies sampling thousands of trans people:

Saying you found 30 who weren't helped by transitioning is like saying antidepressants didn't work for you, so no one else should be taking them.</div>

    <div class="md">This is retarded. If someone is suffering from manic depressive disorder, are you really saying we shouldn’t treat that first? Like it’s a smart thing to believe someone in a manic state that they are trapped in the wrong body. 

The same holds true for a bunch of other comorbid psychiatric disorders. It’s impossible to determine if one psychiatric disorder is causing another. 

Gender dysphoria has a very high comorbidity with other psychiatric diseases and conditions. Why are you a science denier?</div>

Did you suddenly arrive from 1965? It's been called bipolar for a long time.

&gt;Gender dysphoria has a very high comorbidity with other psychiatric diseases and conditions.

One of them has to be the first one treated. Why not dysphoria?

Yet we're apparently 98% accurate with gender dysphoria and transitioning, because the regret rates are found to be roughly 2%. We're not going to stop a proven effective treatment because of a small chance of misdiagnosis.</div>

I really personally feel like so many of these "trans" people do it because they arent popular, and have no luck with the presumed sex they are initially interested in so they change the rules.

    <div class="md">it's from the banout project.  a bunch of radical left extremists got together a few years ago and started making sockpuppet accounts.  they'd then weasel their way onto mod lists of a TON of subs.  their long term plan was basically to become mass moderators of virtually all subs banning all wrongthink.  some of these are openly visible as powermods, literally being on hundreds or thousands of mod lists.  over 90% of subs are infiltrated.  when mods of certain subs wouldn't let them in, quarantines came first, and then admins started forcing them onto modlists.  e.g. cringeanarchy had a tranny added as a mod while quarantined.  there are also sockpuppets on TRP and whereareallthegoodmen.  there is a chapotraphouse shill as moderator of libertarian actively promoting brigading on their discord, and plenty of other examples.

    <div class="md">This last sgdq was actually an improvement over the last few years. From what I've read, protomagical"girl" was not on staff or in attendance this time, and he was the tranny ringleader so most of the others came with him and left with him. 

Regardless, it's still a heavily censored event and the donations go to an NGO that funds illegal immigration and human trafficking that have accelerated the migrant crisis in the US and Europe. That's arguably an even bigger elephant in the room that nobody is allowed to talk about.</div>

    <div class="md">**Femme fatale**

A femme fatale ( or ; French: [fam fatal]), sometimes called a maneater or vamp, is a stock character of a mysterious and seductive woman whose charms ensnare her lovers, often leading them into compromising, dangerous, and deadly situations. She is an archetype of literature and art. Her ability to enchant and hypnotise her victim with a spell was in the earliest stories seen as being literally supernatural; hence, the femme fatale today is still often described as having a power akin to an enchantress, seductress, vampire, witch, or demon, having power over men. 

One of the most common traits of the femme fatale includes promiscuity and the "rejection of motherhood", seen as "one of her most threatening qualities since by denying his immortality and his posterity it leads to the ultimate destruction of the male".
