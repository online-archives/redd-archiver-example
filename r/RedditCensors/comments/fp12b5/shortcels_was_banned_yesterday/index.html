    <div class="md">It's relevant because the white guilt/hatred thing is connected to feminism.

As Jordan Peterson says, these are "Marxist" movements within universities spreading into the general public.

Media, elite universities, etc, there are connections. Watch the people in admissions, presidents, etc. Again, be careful mentioning a particular religion if you don't want to be attacked by said religion:

    <div class="md">&gt; George Orwell was a commie till the end of his life

Absolutely not, he opposed all kinds of totalitarianism, including communism, and hated communism in particular. Communists of the era saw him as a fascist.

Are you on purpose trying to label social democrats as communists? Communists always viewed social democrats as fascists. Social democracy isn't socialist to begin with, nazism however is.</div>

As I already said- check it 1st and save me regurgitating some propaganda BS you heard who-knows-from-where                                 https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/big-brother-how-mi5-kept-watch-on-orwell-463837.html.          The fact that MI5 waited much longer than 30 years to disclose his file, cleared and redacted as always, and trying to present him as a snitch just to sow discord, alienation and disappointment with him had purely nefarious political agenda and Focusing on Orwell’s list, clearly shows he was a staunch leftie. He never expressed any disillusionment with the Soviet system, on the contrary.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly I would mind less if they're gonna be stick-up-the-ass-thought-police if they were at least consistent.

If they ban the sub, they should ban the rest that you mentioned. If they ban fragileblackredditor they should ban fragilewhite.

This way they're just making it worse by creating an us-vs-them mentality instead of a "just be nice to each other"</div>

    <div class="md">Never visited it- but shortcel = short + incel.


Short men complaining about being involuntarily celibate. I imagine they said nasty things about women to vent their frustration and is was cathartic.


Now they're disconnected with a community of similarly unhappy men, and they're still pissed off and sad about being shortcels - but now they don't have a community to blow off steam with.</div>
