      <div class="md">I had my post removed, a car review, which I have posted before and did not have removed.

I wrote to mods:

&gt;I posted https://np.reddit.com/r/Autos/comments/q1clq4/2022_land_rover_defender_xs_special_edition_full and received a message "we are not a place to link spam". How is my post considered spam? It is a car review. Just curious to understand this removal reason.

They wrote:

&gt;Correct. We are not the place to spam links or karma farm.

I replied with:

&gt;I'm confused, how is posting a single link to vehicle review, considered spam? Also, is it against the rules to post reviews? I don't see that rule and I see other reviews up when I search the sub for them. I am not posting to r/autos to karma farm. I legitimately posted a review of a vehicle that I like and wanted to share it to an appropriate sub i.e. autos. I can post to other subs and go to r/all, but as soon as I share something appropriate to a sub where I expect will not get many upvotes, I get my stuff removed and accused of karma farming? Again, I'm not karma farming but what you are saying doesn't even make sense for those who do karma farm, the most karma your posts get is like 1k. Do you see what I am saying?? Anyways, as reviews are seemingly allowed on r/autos, what does it matter whether you think I am posting for karma or to share something I like? I am contributing to your sub and it's not bad content, why censor/remove? How do you make sense of this mod abuse? Do you get off to the power and censoring?

They replied with:

&gt;Sorry mate, we're just not interested in having folks that treat our sub like a place to drop a link and then never come back again.

&gt;Have a good one

My response:

&gt;Hey mate, I have tried to post here numerous times before only to have my posts removed. So clearly I have 'come back' but only to get this same treatment, so what is your thoughts on that? Also, just a fyi but did you know there are accounts with 5/10/20/30 million karma? Having prejudice against accounts with karma is just ridiculous, especially when you take ^ that into consideration.

&gt;I've actually posted here before and my stuff was kept up and left alone, I just did a search and see there are 9 posts from me.

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/Autos/search?q=author%3Akarmagheden&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

&gt;You did not remove those things and call me a karma farmer then, but now you do?

I got this message back:

&gt;&gt;You did not remove those things and call me a karma farmer then, but now you do?

&gt;We did not do our due diligence, apparently. Perhaps we should have warned you on this some time ago?

I replied to that with:



&gt;&gt;We did not do our due diligence, apparently.

&gt;???

&gt;&gt;Perhaps we should have warned you on this some time ago?

&gt;When in any of those instances did I violate the rules?? Also, how is that not contributing and coming back? How is that karma farming when my post are getting 5 to maybe 100 karma?? Come on.

Never heard back. Wasn't banned or muted but this mod is basically telling me I will have my posts removed if I do try to contribute to the sub, despite me showing them I have come back to contribute and have posted there before without issue.

Edit: 5 months later - Just had another post removed:

https://np.reddit.com/r/Autos/comments/tsldes/ferrari_testarossa_vs_lamborghini_countach_battle/

And was temp banned for 30 days for apparently 'No link spam/karma farming.' When I did not spam links and I was not posting to farm karma. I have posted to autos 6 times (not counting the above post) in the last 5 months and none of those posts were removed [(see for yourself)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Autos/search?q=author%3Akarmagheden&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and I was not accused of link spamming/karma farming and banned for those posts, but *was* over this one (?) then muted for 3 days for saying that I did not agree with mods removal/ban reason. No idea what is wrong with the mod but they seem pretty positive they are in the right and think posting pics/video is not contributing to subs and is just spam/posted for karma, even if you genuinely want to share these things because you like them and even if you get very little karma from the post. Makes no sense. So they arbitrarily censor and ban people (the reason for my punishment should totally be up for dispute) and likely brought on by bogus reports by people to get content removed and users punished, but I am lazy the mod tells me. It is the job they chose, they could at least be fair/reasonable when listening to appeals and explanations and I am punished for trying to contribute? Because mods have a prejudice against users who have a bunch of karma? There are no rules against collecting karma and these days it is not hard to do this, again, there are accounts with [5/10/20/30/40 million karma.](https://www.karmalb.com/) Reddit even encourages you to show it off. Just because I have accumulated karma in 3 years over posting stuff I like, does not mean I am just posting to 'farm karma' and not because I like to share cool content I come across. At any rate, seems like a poor reason to axe people from your community. That's another thing to dispute is the mod saying my posting is not me participating in the community. It is 100% contributing and therefor participating, it is also not spam and I only wish to share. I am fine if the post sits at 1 karma.</div>
