So I finally post for the first time in the sub, asking someone for a source regarding something I hadn't heard about Trump. Woke up the next day and found I was perma-banned. Turns out they banned me for concern trolling, you be the judge. This was the thread, my appeal, the mod's response: [https://imgur.com/a/4dDnZYD](https://imgur.com/a/4dDnZYD)

&amp;#x200B;

I'll admit my reply to the mod wasn't really great (I was sour because I liked the sub so much). I guess don't ask anyone for sources there or you get the concern troll ban hammer. </div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, t_D doesn't call itself neutral, and in fact is open about being a never-ending rally with no Leftists allowed.  
I was once banned for concern trolling (same as you) for making a post about what Leftists were talking about in their forums at the time.  
If you care to, you can just say you weren't trying to concern troll and were just trying to engage with the community. I got unbanned that way.</div>

My guess is something similar happened to OP.  Smart to explain yourself and talk to a real person, as I suspect that (by necessity) there may be some auto-modding going on there which makes the first pass robotic and less reasonable like in OP's situation.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean, let’s not pretend they’re reasonable. They’ll ban you just for criticizing Trump. Rule 6 in their sidebar iirc. The “Trump supporters only” one.

Had a similar experience in /r/conservative. I said institutional sexism is a real phenomenon and was told I wasn’t intelligent enough for their community lol.

I think I’m also banned from /r/latestagecapitalism. Fuck all the echo chamber subs, really.

I’ll also say that for all the downvotes I get in /r/politics, I’ve never been banned.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;In an argument (usually a political debate), a concern troll is someone who is on one side of the discussion, but pretends to be a supporter of the other side with "concerns". The idea behind this is that your opponents will take your arguments more seriously if they think you're an ally. Concern trolls who use fake identities are sometimes known as sockpuppets.

    <div class="md">Given 98% of it is uninhabitable desert and there's little to no bush in suburbia, I feel pretty great. My parents have 5 acres, though, and are equipped with a fire brigade class of water pump and hose should any fire breakout, but they've been lucky for the past 21 years to never require it. We also don't have hundreds of retards dying like you yanks did in California last year because we know what we're doing. That's why you're always flying over hundreds of our rural fire fighters when havoc breaks out because you dumb yanks don't know what the fuck you're doing. </div>

    <div class="md">u/zgembo1337 described pretty well why this subreddit tends to be ban-hammer heavy.  
That said - from what I have seen in that subreddit, this is a surprising ban. My bet is that if this is the only reason that a ban was issued - it was probably a mistake of some sort. You could probably send the moderator(s) of the\_Donald a DM with the screenshot for an 'unban'. Mistakes can happen.

Don't know why you wouldn't have tried that first, to be honest.</div>

    <div class="md">You're not missing out on much with TD, I don't hate them either but I would never use them as a news source. They have bias in droves, even if they happen to be right more often than some other political subs.

That said, they get brigaded more than anyone else, I don't blame them for banning what appears to be your alt account. Key word there being 'appears'. Maybe you just lurk a lot, but for the average user your account looks like an alt. I personally don't like bans based on assumptions myself, but I get why they'd be on edge. </div>

    <div class="md">I don't blame them either given how much brigading goes on against them. The annoying thing was, my asking for a source wasn't even counter to Trump/their narrative (I think?). Ah well.

You're kind of right about this being an alt-account and I hadn't thought about this being a factor. I had lost interest in reddit during the mass censorship that started a few years ago and deleted my account back then. So when I came back somewhat recently I had to make a new account that I never post on really.</div>

    <div class="md">If it helps, "look but don't touch" is the best policy to have with TD. A million years ago I used to chime in there myself, even sometimes to argue with them. And no matter what I said, for or against, I'd have some shithead in another sub try to invalidate anything I said with "you t_d poster, orange man bad, you bad, me triggered unga bunga". Not that that won them the argument, but most people who make that argument do so because they're not clever enough come up with anything else. And taking that last tiny sliver of hope from them does my heart good. </div>

    <div class="md">I was banned once for when there was a divide between supporting or criticizing Sessions. Now it’s ok to criticize Sessions. You have to realize it’s hard to tell the difference between honest criticism and astroturfers sewing seeds of discontent. Pysops are real and Soros groups are getting smarter. If you hang long enough you can see how stupid memes flood New when actual news hits. It’s not pedes meming. 

Accidental bans happen, but if you cool down and explain yourself (and have good post history), they will unban you. There was a huge influx of trolls around the new year and you probably got reported a lot by other pedes. I’ve seen a lot of innocent people ask for sauce and not get banned. </div>

    <div class="md">Maybe being an alt could get you banned, even though I'd disagree with that rule. But I've asked for sources on multiple occasions and haven't been banned, so if it's just your comment in isolation then I'm a bit puzzled. Maybe they flagged it as concern trolling, which has been a BIG deal in the past.</div>

    <div class="md">Fair enough. You're right, the mods are actually pretty good.

I remember politics had a livechat during the 2016 election. I got pretty drunk watching the election results, so when it was over and Trump won I went through the scrolling chat and trolled upset/sad Democrats with a video of a 'reeeeeee'ing frog. I told them I would sing them the song of their people. Must have posted it 10 times, at least.

Only got a temp ban for a week. I thought that was very fair.

    <div class="md">&gt; As already said, it is a fan club, not a place designed for any real discussion unfortunately

I disagree - I think having a club house is fine *as long as there's somewhere to discuss things with them* - and that's what askthedonald is for. I fully encourage any other political groups to do the same!</div>

    <div class="md">Well, i see your point, but i must disagree. The idea of a club is that it's a place where people who have similar ideas about a given topic (enjoyment of disc golf/trump supporters/etc) can congregate. It doesn't make much sense for someone who dislikes disc golf to be in a disc golf club, or to attend their meetings, or participate in their discussions.

Thus, I think its perfectly fine for a club to not entertain people who think differently about the subject of the club. Of course, politics is a bit different, considering discussion is an integral part of it, but I still don't think they need to entertain arguments that go against their core principals (e.g. Trump is good). 

Now, I would prefer all political groups allow discussion from all points of view. However, I just don't think that's a realistic expectation, probably for the worse.</div>

    <div class="md">Sorry mate - looking back at your comment that I replied to I completely misunderstood. I think we actually agree, having a club house for your political friends to banter and talk in is fine and they have no moral responsibility to let everyone it. My only qualm which I think you share is that discussion has to happen *somewhere*. It seems like you want it in these subs, whereas I think it's better to have dedicated, seperate places to talk about that shit.

Anyways, thanks for your patience and sorry if I mangled anything. </div>

Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially "remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word".

You're useless.

    <div class="md">They banned me for not being a Trump supporter, which I am not. At least I actually broke the rules there. It's a shame because I find talking to Trump supporters really interesting, because they make up a large chunk of our society, and I want to understand their opinions, as much as I disagree with them. I don't like the ask subreddits because I prefer a back and forth to just being limited to asking questions.

In your case, I don't know what the hell is going on. In my appeal the mod said that their goal is to basically be a 24/7 Trump rally. I'm guessing asking for a source is not their idea of a 24/7 Trump rally?</div>

    <div class="md">I was very civil, actually. Why would I not be? My comments were all heavily upvoted, because I started the discussion admitting Trump is right about an issue (Syria withdrawal). The discussion was about liberals and leftists now being in favour of war because Trump wanted to withdraw from Syria, and I interjected to say no I am a liberal and I agree with Trump on this one issue, and I'm not going to disagree with him just because he is Trump. Still got banned, but technically I was in violation of their rules, because I am not a Trump supporter.</div>

    <div class="md">Dude, read the rules in their sidebar.

"Rule 6: This forum is for Trump supporters only. If you have questions about our president, our way of thinking or other discussion question, post on r/AskThe_Donald, where we will gladly answer. "

This is what I was banned for, per the mod who banned me.

They do not let leftists post comments, even if they are completely civil. Their goal for the sub is a 24/7 Trump rally, that is what the mod explicitly told me when I asked for clarification.

What's more I am completely fine with this. I intentionally broke the rules, knowing it would probably lead to me getting banned, and lo and behold I got banned. </div>

    <div class="md">There isn't a problem at all, this isn't my thread, I was responding to OP over why he was banned, and the standards on that sub in terms of it being a 24/7 Trump rally based on what I know having been banned there myself.

Also, yes, seeing as you mention it, many of the liberal subs on here have no interest in free exchange of ideas between Trumpers and anti-Trumpers, either.

As someone in the middle—a liberal, but not an SJW, and not a Trump supporter, either—it's getting really fatiguing.</div>
