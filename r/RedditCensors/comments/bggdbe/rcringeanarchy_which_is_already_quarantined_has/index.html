    <div class="md">And /r/worldnews is basically "how can I post some Trump shit with a vague reference to another country to dodge the non-US only news requirement". How the fuck is it okay for that subreddits entire frontpage to be Trump/Mueller or whatever the fuck they cook up next. For other news topic, you can't have more than one post per topic, even if a ton of new information has come out and the original thread was locked, but 50 posts about the same Trump thing is okay.</div>

    <div class="md">Haven't really been there, but had no idea they were right-leaning? Also I find it counter-productive to just censor the opposition. It just makes their supporters more loyal. I don't know if Trump will win 2020, but his opposition is just too weak atm. The Dems need to just get better candidates if they want to win. All of this pussy-footing around will get them nowhere.</div>

    <div class="md">Honestly, to say CA is "right leaning" is a bit disingenuous. They're alt-right by the actual definition of the term (as opposed to the /r/politics definition of "anyone I disagree with"). Lots of white nationalists, antisemitism, and anti-Islam. Granted, they're mostly shitposting and being edge lords, but its still there.

Got some Q-Anon types and other conspiracy nutters too.

Having said that, I absolutely detest reddit's plan to ban them. Quarantine was enough (and imo, still kinda shitty but I get it).</div>

The ironic thing is how the far left types defend their practices and ideology... really it just betrays a sort of soft racism that prevails on the left, i.e. "those poor poor helpless minorities need me, a guilty white person living in the West, to lift them out of their cycle of poverty and violence"</div>

    <div class="md">Again, I really think you need to re-read the definition of conservatism. I am NOT comparing American conservatives (i.e. Republicans) to Islamists. But both groups *are* conservative. 

Your post that I replied to:

&gt; ironic because they also say conservatism and radical Islam shared the same beliefs

I'm using the context you started with.

That's not irony, that's just them being wrong. What they're trying, but failing to say is that both are conservative ideologies, which is correct... that doesn't make them similar in any way other than being conservative ideologies though!</div>

    <div class="md">Well, I was just exposing how hypocritical the left actually is...

They defend Islamists and Muslims in general while acting like American conservatives (Republicans, Trump supporters, etc.) are literally Nazis...

When in reality Islam is MUCH more conservative, and MUCH closer to Nazism than Republicans. Its hilarious.</div>

    <div class="md">No, being anti-Islam is not what makes someone alt-right. Alt-right is defined as white nationalism and right-wing populism.

And I'm not saying that everyone in CA is alt-right ('cause that'd make me alt-right too). But it's wrong to say those types and their rhetoric aren't there too.</div>

    <div class="md">Historical elections tell you Trump will win by a large margin but he isn't taking it lightly, it most likely will be some poor DNC stooge going into a slaughter house...

Sitting presidents are most likely elected again than not.

Sitting presidents never get voted out with a strong economy and low unemployment.

Parties often win in twos and if they do really well 3s and that is the few times a sitting president gets voted out ( see Bush Sr. After two Regan terms as an example)

Then two bill Clinton's, then two bushes, then two Obama, you will now get two Trump's.

His approval rating is decent, economy is strong, lots of people working, gas prices mild at least and could dip back down again, no major wars, NK is at least calmed down a lot.

The average person is sitting pretty content and happy....</div>

    <div class="md">You're a fucking idiot, literally nobody I know has a good view on Trump. No normal sane person supports him.

Unemployment has been reduced in the middle and upper classes, but the lower class has literally never been worse off.

Issues with North Korea, Russia and the Arab world are at an all time high and Trump in many situations has literally been a trigger away from war.

There is not a chance in hell that Trump is getting re-elected.</div>

    <div class="md">No, cringe anarchy is being banned because they have broken the rules multiple times and have been sending death threats to reddit admits. 

Their users are being very violent, saying racist and anti-semitic shit. The mods are doing nothing at all, in fact they are encouraging this kind of behavior, which is disgusting.

[Here is a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/uh6qY5UH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) detailing all of the violence that the sub has done, the radio silence the mods have, and the unwillingness to actually freaking moderate.

Please stop telling lies about this story, and tell the truth.</div>

I'm sorry you feel that I was being biased. I really wasn't. I'm just trying to be as lenient as possible when it comes to comment removal. That's all it is. I genuinely feel like you're mistaking me for one of the shitty mods we post in this sub about all the time. I assure you I'm not.

If I were, would I show this kind of concern about your feelings? No, I'd tell you to fuck off, remove your comment, and ban your ass. I'm not that kind of mod. This isn't that kind of sub. Sorry you feel the way you do though. I do hope I can change your mind.</div>

    <div class="md">I believe a comment calling for a genocide of an entire group of people based on their skin color alone, is grounds for a removal of that specific comment.

If you can't see THAT, then maybe you're not fit to be moderating a goddamn thing. Much less, having children.

FUCK all of these people advocating for exterminating the race of people that brought about, and created the 21st century.

Yet, you're willing to give them all a pass! Even as a self professed "white person"! (Which I highly doubt, at this point)

How would you feel if I said "hang all n1ggers now! (Which I would never do)... Would THAT be grounds for removal?!

Why is it so different when it comes to "white" people?! Because we're not "oppressed"?! Because we have culture? Because we're civil?! Because we have intelligence?
