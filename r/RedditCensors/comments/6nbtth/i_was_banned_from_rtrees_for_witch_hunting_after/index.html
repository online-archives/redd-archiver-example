    <div class="md">Back before Reddit sold out I called out a mod of OWS (occupy Wall Street) about similar things.  Turned out he was working with the feds and was a censor mod.  Really flipped my image of Reddit.   This place is counter info tech.   Most subreddit in the last year or so which were defaults were replaced of mods.

    <div class="md">even to the mods at /r/the_donald , really. I love the place and people, but the mods are cancerous and its difficult not to think that one of them is on the other team, especially after the top mods were replaced overnight over... something by reddit admins. The modding changed overnight after they did nothing... before there was some investigation (actual decent stuff, i.e. Hillary's server technician asking how to delete a server after getting a subpoena). But after.... nothing, and asking them to change it in the slightest gets you banned, blocked, muted etc...

Politics has been ran by Sharia blue, and honeslty likely in some way parts of the government. News is ideological filth, but could likely be police aswell due to how many things are censored there and never seen the light (the other shit around rising events are ideologically censored though). 

But the reddit admins, just.... jesus fucking christ, I dont know if they are complicit for self motivation reasons (nice site you got, would be a shame if we... woops you just broke my favourite FBI mug, looks like you just assulted me) or ideological. I honestly cant tell, maybe both

and yeah, ive noticed the shift happen aswell. The problem I see is there is no alternative, and I dont think there is room for disrupter websites anymore, minds dot com is the closest ive found and thats a specific group of people who put people off sometimes (shitposters &lt;3 , but we arent loved. No mass apeal, and barely enough for a niech)</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, the people 9/10 are great. Mods are cancer, atleast once the original mods disappeared by admins or doxxing/death threats. 

The place is meant to be where social constrictions of society die, freedom is unlimited and the main goal is having fun and watching/causing Marxism to suffer and get out of power (so wrong think is banned, which I can understand. Not condone but understand). Its a terrible shame the mods are just pure cancer, mark my words, as soon Trump does something of actual concern to criticize (something which isnt partisan that Obama would be beaten for at his height), then it will stop being fun to ironically say we love our echo chamber only due to the censorship

Because once reality isnt on there side, the ideological authoritarianism will take control of key pieces of power. </div>

    <div class="md">I've said it before and I'll say it again. Reddit has completely lost its integrity and has achieved tabloid status with me and almost everyone I know. 

In casual discussion among friends, family and even coworkers, I've discovered that a majority of us surf Reddit for its niche content and satire/humor. Anyone that pays any attention at all to the news or political content is quick to point out the obvious bias and knows that those sectors are infested with extremists, shills and indoctrinated mindless drones.

Reddit has become nothing more than the comic section of the newspapers of yesterday. Sadly even a lot of the niche subs have fallen victim to the extreme bias. 

Reddit use is declining but is being reported as gaining popularity recently. I read an article in a tech magazine that showed several instances of bot padding to create an illusion of popularity. I'd cite the source but there are so many that it rather pointless and a simple search turns up a plethora.

Reddit is nowhere near as popular as it has been reported and its a huge relief to know that.</div>
