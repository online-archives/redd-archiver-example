I'm seeing it all over where there is not middle ground, and no discussion.  

 -  "There are problems with both sides" - removed.   
 - "I agree with points 1 and 3, but not 2" -  removed.   
 -  "I respectfully disagree with your political stance for these reasons:" - get called a nazi/communist/fascist/cop lover/cop hater/libtard/trumptard etc.

Often the mods of these subs will cite vague rules like "be civil" (anyone who disagrees is uncivil), while allowing a flood of uncivil comments, so long as they attack the correct ideology or person.  I'm not going to clutter this thread with examples, but take a gander at my recent comment history for threads that have stuff like 120 comments, but only 20 visible.

I've been banned from many subs that shouldn't be political in nature by babyish mods who have extremely poor discourse skills.

Is there any place left on this site that's not plagued by this *lord-of-the-flies-esque* tribalism?</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah I looked at your comment history and I agree you’re being heavily subjected to bias a lot of the time. Sometimes you’re running on that fine line where you might be censored out because of lack of decorum, like when you name call, a mod might ban you because you’re being hostile. Most of the time not though, and they’re jumping to conclusions or censoring you because you like to be contrarian it seems as a hobby. I think you’re not wrong a lot of the time though I don’t personally like your comments and find you’re being a bit toxic and negative as well as well as calling entire groups of people idiots and retards, but I think you should have the right to say what you want to say on a sub, especially larger subs. If the sub is a small community that relies on a friendly decorum, then I think it’s fair to censor you out for lack of decorum.</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah, I'll admit that's a bit crass, and I say retarded a bit more out of spite, since I literally got the mega b&amp;hammer for saying "retarded" one day, but then they magically lifted the auto-site permaban for it shortly after, but ignored my appeal.   Very strange.

Maybe the hostile makeup comes from the whole validation thing we all seek, where I hate being corralled like sheep with one  narrow viewpoint, and can recognize that because A is bad, it doesn't mean B is good.  But if I insult B, it must mean I'm Pro-A + all the ragebait.   This binary thinking they're imposing on people is just making the whole place stupider, and making people think they're all on extreme teams, and this comment grooming of anything outside of that image only makes it look even more-so like that to any onlookers.</div>

    <div class="md">It’s very frustrating for sure and happens all over the internet. I’ve found that the most effective form of persuasion is simply exposure and representation more so than arguing or even debate. Simply stating your world view or lifestyle can influence the perimeter of people who can have their minds changed who then work that influence towards the center of their in-group. And if it’s any small consolation, even your downvoted comments are likely still getting views so you still have somewhat of a platform there even if it just seems like your catching hate or are being mischaracterized. People who agree are much less likely to upvote compared with downvotes.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not out to change someone's views.  You can believe in something different, and if that offends either one of us, and it stays up, that's proof that there's some semblance of an open forum.  It doesn't happen on reddit.

These "in groups" on reddit haven't been made by people in those groups, but rather manipulated by a few mods who want to make it appear so.  That's fine if it's clear that's what the group is, but there are many subs now on reddit with generic names that try and appear neutral, while constantly injecting political propaganda.  When you see a thread with maybe 30 comments, and "150 comments" listed at the top, you know things are getting heavily shaped, and those user's comments that get removed have no idea they're invisible to everybody else.</div>

    <div class="md">I’ve only been using this site a little more recently. But this wasn’t always the case. Back during the 2016 election, r/The_Donald was regularly on the front page with tons of legitimate support. Going by how biased Reddit is currently, you wouldn’t have believed that possible. But it goes to show how much manipulation has occurred. 

It’s the reason I left the site. Popular, apolitical subreddits started banning you if you so much as commented in these subs they deemed “hateful.” It’s all a means of control. There is regularly left-wing misinformation on the front page that is never corrected. Try to point it out and you’ll be downvoted to oblivion. 

It’s unnatural social engineering. It has created more hate and division. There’s no middle ground because it was intentionally destroyed to make you shut up and obey.

Apolitical are the most concerning, as if it's called /r/liberalssuck or /r/conservativessuck then you know what it's going to be, but if it's something generic like /r/desks or /r/chairs, you shouldn't expect virtuesignalling threads to be heavily moderated such as: 
 "Hey, I'm a [f]urrysexual gun toting pitbull owner who left an abusive relationship and lost [m]y job today, and I know it's not much, but turned this scrap pallet into a table + chair; love me plz".    Obviously I'm exaggerating and just made up sub names instead of using real examples, but you get the idea.</div>
