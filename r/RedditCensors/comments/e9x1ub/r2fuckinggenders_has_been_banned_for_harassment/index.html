I tried to link my post on r/reclassified, but the automod won't let me.

The only thing we allowed on that sub were posts about there only being 2 valid genders. All posts and comments against regular transgender people were removed and we banned all racist users and everything that could be considered harassment.

Yet they banned it anyway. There were no valid reasons whatsoever, why this sub should be banned.</div>

    <div class="md">It isn't about the context of the subreddit, it is about the premise of the subreddit. 

I honestly, and sincerely hope and pray that the people pushing these censorships realize how this ends. How the only way this ends.  I suspect long before the 90% of people are willing to be silenced and shackled or else they be "removed" they decide it is the 10% that need to be removed. 

I think a vast majority of us - first allies - that believed "live and let live" as the premise for fighting for homosexual rights, are looking around now and wondering where it all went so horribly wrong.</div>

    <div class="md">Not at all unbelievable, as much as I loathe to say it.  This is plain and simple censoring ideas "reddit" (and those who control it) does not agree with.  This platform is dying, as are the other mainstream platforms, as they continue to ban ideas they do not agree with.  Big tech is doing a disservice to freedom, it is shameful.

I get it, private platform, they can do what they want.  They are not even enforcing their *own* rules equally.  It is just so meek.  They are trying to hide it, there is no honour in that.  Know who you are and be it, don't pretend to hide behind something you are not.

We need a reddit clone, publicly funded, that adheres to nothing more or nothing less than the rule of law.</div>

    <div class="md">How the fuck is that "harassment" though? Apparently even relatively mild criticism of their agenda is no longer allowed on Reddit.

They don't even care about their content policy anymore. It's just become a list of possible excuses they can use to ban anything that they don't like, no matter if it actually breaks said policy.

And if they don't find a reason in their policy, they can just ban the sub for being unmoderated after suspending all its moderators, then ban all related subs for "ban evading" the first sub.</div>
