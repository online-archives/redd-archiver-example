      <div class="md">Had my post [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/mhf9qe/open_biden/) removed after it had been up for a day and I was given no explanation as to what warranted its removal. They almost always remove my posts and usually the reason given is it's not funny/made no effort to be funny, which is absurd because the same meme is being upvoted on leftist subs, so I think the mods at politicalhumor just like to abuse their power and remove stuff they don't personally find funny (e.g. usually stuff that shows corp center dems in a negative light), which is wrong. You don't have to find it funny to see that others can and do.

So I messaged the mods about this and received no response. I replied to a user in the thread, who happens to be a mod (a mod who has openly attacked me in threads and called me names like 'tankie' among others like bad faith troll and joined in on ganging up on me and downvote brigading my comments) and this person told me I would probably get better answers through modmail. I answered that I had not heard back from modmail. They said/implied that mods not responding *was* their response. I responded with "when you want people to know you're scum." and was subsequently banned for 30 days. I thought my reply was appropriate for the treatment I've received and been receiving from these mods and other users of this community whenever I would post anything critical/poking fun at Biden or any other corp center dem. I don't think the post removal was warranted, nor do I think the 30 day temp ban is fair, but it just highlights just what kind of people are running things over there. 

Just want to add that I have and have had a 15 minute post wait to that sub from the very beginning and so this sucks when you have multiple people responding to you with ad homs/fallacious rebuttals, attacking and smearing you and or the content creators and you quite literally spend hours responding to people in good faith and finding them citation just for you to be downvoted anyways, and then have your comment and or the post removed. It's just despicable that mods take part in this and have no sympathy for those on the receiving end.

Mod abuse like this, I think is a Reddit wide issue.</div>
