**Re: You've Been Permanently Banned From Participating In** r/Politics

subreddit message via [/r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics)\[[M](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/about/moderators)\] sent 21 minutes ago

Our rule:

&gt;Do not threaten, advocate for, **celebrate, or express extreme indifference** towards any kind of action that results in or could result in death or harm (physical or otherwise). This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this behavior may be subject to a permanent subreddit ban.

What you posted:

&gt;Rush was a professional liar and was bent on making americans turn on each other. **He can die sooner than later. Bye bye rush.**

What freedom of speech covers:

&gt;**Congress** shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

&amp;#x200B;

This was in the state of the union live thread somewheres around 9-12k comments in idk. Catch a sub wide ban for mocking Rush Limbaugh.

Naturally they don't want "free speech" when it hurts their feelings. All I did was express my own joy/reasoning at rush's imminent  passing. Not to mention I'm actually personally offended the medal of freedom went to a straight up liar and instigator, and someone who denied secondhand smoke kills (it does, I know from experience). Even though I disagree. It obviously still happened and its still his dumb medal now.

 What I'm getting at is how does anyone expect unity or dialogue to even happen between parties online when you get into big live threads and catch a ban in between 12k comments for..something trollish like laughing at rush limbaugh?

Kind of a big yikes they pretend to be better than T\_D while being nazi mods themselves. When someone claims free speech online they arent usually trying to bring up the legal terminology..It's more like an automatic quick response instead of typing up  "I have an opinion that might be strongly different than yours but i wish to express it, feel free to engage in dialogue and we may even have to defend our opposing views in civil discussion or you can move on" A cowardly ban was the mods first action of course.

 Goodluck winning over any uneducated people who may be trying to become engaged but say something dumb or offensive. You're going to just ban them and not win them over to your cause. Creating your own enemies if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Try to be active in r/politics and catch a ban from snowflake mod. No discussion. Just a rule the mod chose to hide behind and interpret in bad faith:

Our rule:

&gt;Do not threaten, advocate for, **celebrate, or express extreme indifference** towards any kind of action that results in or could result in death or harm (physical or otherwise). This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this behavior may be subject to a permanent subreddit ban.

I would also stress that my comment couldnt possibly result in death or harm. You're a fucking liar for pretending my comment should be interpreted in such a manner. You owe me an apology shitmod.</div>

    <div class="md">Shocking that that cesspool of rabid leftist / Shareblue propaganda would ban someone for this. They hate anyone slightly right of Marx, and regularly allow just such disgusting messages as OP was regurgitating.

OP, your message is bad, and you should feel bad. You absolutely belong at /politics like the rest of the blind haters and rabid leftist shills.

That said, can't see why /politics banned you for something they allow on the daily, or worse.</div>

    <div class="md">I am really surprised that politics banned an angry leftist drone mantra.   
    
That said, celebrating the death of another human being is characteristic of  miserable and horrible people, so fuck you.    
    
A friend of mine died of cancer few months ago. He fought cancer for three years, and that illness consumed him. He left a wife and two kids.    
    
I pity the individual so consumed by hate and anger that celebrates that kind of thing to anyone. I really hope nor you or anyone you know has to endure that kind of torment, ever.</div>

I never said it's not an echo chamber. Just that you don't get banned for going against the echo chamber. And their criteria for banning is if you break the sub's rules or site wide rules, and they tend to apply it fairly, as you can see by this guy getting banned.</div>

&gt; Do not threaten, advocate for, celebrate, or express extreme indifference towards any kind of action that results in or could result in death or harm (physical or otherwise). This rule applies to everyone. Users who engage in this behavior may be subject to a permanent subreddit ban.

    <div class="md">Chat scrolls are always shit shows. I can't imagine trying to moderate those.

I honestly don't see how anyone can even attempt outrage here.  As soon as RL's health was made public, they made the statement that shit-talking his health would not be tolerated. I think they did the right thing, and they followed through with the threat seemingly against what most would consider their own echo-chamber base.

    <div class="md">1) I never said you didn't have the freedom to do so, but I have the freedom to call you out for being a piece of shit, which you absolutely, indisputably are. That's what makes this country so great.

2) Ironic that you seem to be supporting individual liberty (e.g., being able to say whatever you want) as a leftist considering your politics are directly opposed to individual liberties. Although from prior experience I'd say it's more of a "rules for thee, but not for me" situation.</div>

    <div class="md">OP is an absolute massive faggot as well as a complete fucking retard.  
OP: "I wished for Rush Limbaugh to die and got banned, how are we supposed to have constructive dialogue?" 

Edit: I won't crypost elsewhere if this comment gets me banned, because I know most subs aren't down with words like, "faggot," unlike OP, who is completely incapable of the most basic reading comprehension.</div>

    <div class="md">That's nice. Online you are unfortunately restricted by the private companies that host your content. Your options are to start your own hosting service and create your own site but I know you already know this you seem like a smart person.

 I bet you have this feeling deep inside you and you might now admit it yet, but you have this feeling that you know trump will win again. Every day that goes by you see your candidates get screwed over by the DNC or you know that your preferred candidate is unviable especially against Trump. Did you know that 75+ percent of independents liked his speech last night? O well a smart person like you already knows this. Have a great day.

    <div class="md">A lot of political subs have no interest in free speech. And a lot of supposedly left-wing subs now openly flair their posts and have a moderation policy in the style of r/The_Donald, i.e. no dissent. I got banned from r/centerleftpolitics for saying that I thought Bernie had a better chance of winning the presidency than Klobuchar. And I'm not even a Bernie supporter!</div>

What freedom of speech covers:

&gt;**Congress** shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
