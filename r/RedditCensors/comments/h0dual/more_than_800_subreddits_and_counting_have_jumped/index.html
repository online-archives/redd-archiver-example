    <div class="md">&gt; the terrible new.reddit design.

is it?  because to me who uses the text-based version of reddit, it's basically the same.  the only thing i've noticed is that the image pop-out is a little differently shaped.

but yes Saidit is another good alternative if your interest groups went there. mine didn't.

the owners of the two platforms are actually helping each other instead of competing which is also a good sign.</div>

Censorship is never the answer, and the internet is not your safe space.  I'm stunned that there are this many clueless people out there, although I probably shouldn't be.  Ban WrongThink™, report your neighbor, get people with whom you disagree fired, etc.  It's scary.</div>

    <div class="md">Liberals of today are about authoritarianism, support for racism, support for homophobia, support for rape, support for censorship, support for Nazism, support for violence based on race, violence based on religion, religious bigotry, and just plain hatred.  In reality, they are the fascists they claim to work against.

Edit: Waaaah the fascist left is mad</div>

    <div class="md">I'm having a hard time finding any crimes in America because the search engines keep returning looting.   But stories like [this one from Sweden](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7813499/Swedish-judges-refuse-deport-Eritrean-refugees-gang-raped-woman-hours.html) are increasingly common throughout the world.  

Here's a Financial Times article explaining how [the left's ideology is fascist](https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/philip-cross-the-anti-fascist-left-were-the-real-fascists-all-along).    Hard to argue considering like 5 more of my favorite subs got banned yesterday for wrong think.

BLM has been [calling for killing whites](https://www.breitbart.com/border/2015/08/28/black-activists-called-for-lynching-and-hanging-of-white-people-and-cops/) since its inception.  And of course professors like this one are [lauded for their progressive views](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/when-is-it-ok-to-kill-whites/).  

If you pay attention you will notice the messaging every day.   Just the fact that the news always point out race if a criminal is white but they always just say "man" or "person" when the criminal isn't.

    <div class="md">A poor analogy perhaps, but a moderator plays a similar role in a forum as a police officer does in society, perhaps brute force isn't the answer right now... maybe open discussions are, I am new to reddit, and if I understand the purpose to the sub reddit that wrote the open letter, it can do more then simply highlight racist comments, it can openly start a conversation with the problem they are most certainly looking to face, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of problems in the world, changing someones mind is far more challenging then pushing them underground. maybe I don't understand something going on though, it really doesn't make sense to me.</div>
