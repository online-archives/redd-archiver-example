    <div class="md">This anti-racist comment was also removed by the bootlicker mods:

&gt;China can't win a conventional war at this point so they are going for a culture war.  
&gt;  
&gt;The average American citizen is still very conscious of his freedom and will never be agreed to enslavement by the evil CCP. So they are going for soft power.  
&gt;  
&gt;With a certain satanic joy, the CCP is lurking in wait for unsuspecting young people. With every means they want to destroy the democratic foundations of the Free Western World that they are trying to subjugate. And just as they are trying to corrupt the youth, they aren't shrinking back from infiltrating traditional media (Hollywood) and academic institutions (why do you think Chinese people are so opposed to Affirmative Action, for instance)?  
&gt;  
&gt;If, with the help of his totalitarian creed, China is victorious over the other peoples of the world, then it will be the end of civilization as we know it.</div>

    <div class="md">Thank you for your forthright comments about China, which is as evil as the USSR was back in day (and let's not go to where it is with Putin right now).  The US has its issues.  But communism has been proven, time and again, to be a flawed, cruel, and genocidal system.</div>
