    <div class="md">No, it was about divesting the T from the LBG movement. 

They felt the "movement" had gone beyond what the original goals of the gay and bi community had sought, which was tacit acceptance. They were also tired of being called transphobic for actually having a genital preference. The consensus there was that the TRA community was making "gay" almost meaningless if you have "lesbians" who are trying to guilt lesbians to accept their "girl-penis," or vice versa with trans "men." 

If it really was a choice, then all the "born this way" thinking goes out the window. At that point, you're being asked to override what literally makes you gay so that a trans person won't call you a TERF or transphobic or a bigot. 

They also didn't care for the extremely violent rhetoric coming out of the TRA community. For example, the last post I saw today was a reference to a post in r/teenagers about wanting to punch a /r/LGBDropTheT person in the face. Or the other stuff about saying TERFs or non-accepting gay individuals (transphobic bigots, naturally) deserve to die or should be shot, etc.

They also didn't care for the co-opting of the Stonewall Riots by TRA. Notably specifying that the "trans" person of color was actually just a drag queen, not actually trans, and actually arrived after the riots had already begun. 

They also tended to not agree with gender-reassignment treatment or surgery below the age of majority. Given that such treatments are not easily reversible, it seemed irresponsible to put those kinds of decisions in the hands of people who can't always be trusted with smaller decisions, much less life-altering ones like this one.

It wasn't about denying Trans people rights, mind you. It was about not having trans activist dominate the movement at the expense of people that are merely gay or bisexual. The level of denial of both being gay and bisexual was regularly on display in posts that were from TRA or other "queer" folk who seemed to either despise or reject gay and bisexual individuals, especially if they were "cis-scum" or the like.

They were against the radicalization of the overall movement that had gone from letting people live their lives and on to forcing others to accept things that may not be for them.

If this feels incomplete, it would likely be better explained by someone who was active and more fitting the demographic of the subreddit. I was just a lurker/observer. It was a reassuring place that sanity hadn't fled all quarters on the social "left."</div>

    <div class="md">Thanks for the detailed reply. 

I dont understand why having a genital preference is transphobic? That sounds weird to me - does not liking a vaginas make me hetrogenitalphobic or femalebodyphobic - it just sounds silly and made up. 

Everyone likes what they like as long as its consensual and above legal age its gg. How can anyone much less someone from the (i cant believe im typing these letters since i didnt know it existed the l-g-b community) who themselves have faced judgement for liking the same genetilia why judge someone over what they like? 

As for the militant thing well you get that from people who are fanatic rick and morty fans ffs - nationalism, rascims ect so the fact that the trans community have a militant vocal minority should not be suprising, unique or something to judge them over- i dont judge americans by the loud trump suppotters for example.</div>

You don't think having a genital preference is transphobic, and the subreddit didn't think it is, but there are people out there saying that if you come across a trans person and they're, say a trans man, if you  were to reject or not be interested in a relationship because you won't accept their "boi pussy," you're a transphobic bigot. This is the thinking that the subreddit was rejecting. 

There were trans people in the sub who also felt some TRA people were going too far in trying to make or force others to acknowledge their choices to the point of claiming that if you're gay and don't accept trans people as potential sexual partners, you're TERF scum. 

The worrying thing was seeing how often trans-women were having an influence on places that were ostensibly only for women like r/lesbians or r/actual lesbians. There were cases highlighted where it was becoming normal for posts to complain about people not accepting girl-dick or being insistent that only "true" lesbians weren't afraid of girl-dick. 

Honestly, wish you could have been there when it was up because I'm probably one of the last people who should be explaining this.</div>

    <div class="md">But their accusations are false. Just plain wrong like when someone says two dudes is sick. Wrong - so either ignore and do your own thing or openly discuss and engage with them on why they are wrong. In the hope of changing some militant trans minds - the same way i try and change patriots/nationalists minds. Hiding away in own subs does nothing. For example i spent time on both thedonald and marchagainsttrump rathar than look for a sub that bashes and exludes them i enage rather than ignore. 

Maybe ive had my head in the sand for a few years but i thought trans hatred was mostly from the uneducated communities  - like the way hatred of gays was fuled through ignorance, religion ect. I also remember seeing a few posts that bi people get excluded or that some people wont date a bi person because of fear they will be dropped for the other sex / baby in 10 years. That sounds like peoples own fears manifesting but again thats a vocul minority of gays and lesbians right? 

So arnt the loud trans phobia accusers the same general idea - not the majority but the ones who upset, trigger / most upvotes so it seems like its not a big enough deal that it needed its own sub. Is there a r/imathiestbutithinkthatifgodexistshelovesfags . Think of someone who rants false accusations as one of those "god gates fags" sign people - equally ridiculous so just ignore or debate but exclusion and seems like it will create more problems.

Think young teens who find hate subs or 4chan can greatly effect and normalise racism, bigitory or nationslmism before they find themselves - what if a gay teen finds and spends time on the exclude trans sub?  Ends up thinking all trans like the way some idiots think all muslims are bad.

Thanks for explaining your perspective to me but i think there are long term risks associated with exclusion - by banning the anti trans sub all that will happrn to its users elsewhere is that some people might get accused of something they are not? (Phobic).  Its like the people from thedonald who go around other subs calling people traitors  they just look silly out of touch and uneducated and they are not that convincing so if a trans person calls out for being phobic then downvote or reply and say no thats not phobic if im not attracted.  To that picture.</div>

&gt;I dont understand why having a genital preference is transphobic? That sounds weird to me - does not liking a vaginas make me hetrogenitalphobic or femalebodyphobic - it just sounds silly and made up. 


It's absolutely not made up. If you think through the logic of trans ideology that has over taken the movement, this is the only logical conclusion you can come to. If a trans woman is literally a woman then cutting them out of your dating pool *is * transphobic because you're denying that they are anything but a woman. They are not happy with the sentiment that "transwomen are transwomen and that's perfectly okay" they see that as transphobic. To them the only acceptable message is that "transwomen are literally just women".


&gt;As for the militant thing well you get that from people who are fanatic rick and morty fans ffs - nationalism, rascims ect so the fact that the trans community have a militant vocal minority should not be suprising, unique or something to judge them over-

It is when the movement actually embraces these ideas and does nothing to distance themselves from their militants. Democrats and leftists have the same problem, they never speak out against the more radical subsets of their ideologies. Right wingers tend to be vocal about condemning the white supremacists on their side.

Edit: I'm not saying that rational and normal trans people don't exist, their voices are just not amplified. I follow Blaire White because she is a rational trans person who doesn't deny biological reality and rejects the radicals, but even she gets so much hate. Ironically she is called transphobic and bigoted by other LGBTQ+ people.</div>

    <div class="md">So was the conservative gay and lesbian subreddit they banned. It was very down to earth and level headed. They just were not communists, were embarrassed by the kind of gays who perform sex acts in front of kids in public at parades, and believed in science. It's like Republican minorities, the people who control Reddit cant afford, especially in an election year, to have the narrative drift away from the one they are trying to sell that minorities and alternative life style folks are all in lock step politically and share the same monolithic values. See their old white presidential candidate telling black people your not really black if you don't vote for him.</div>

    <div class="md">Everyone else is saying *all* censorship is wrong. 

You are saying, "it's morally okay if it's it's a private company," and you're not understanding why people are disagreeing with you.

The "core concept" is that we believe ALL censorship is wrong, regardless of whether or not it's by the government or a private entity. 

I will say, this current administration has been extremely good with not infringing on rights, unlike the past administration that threw reporters in prison for not sharing their sources.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean a democratic problem, as a problem for democracy. Silencing viewpoints creates extremists and doesnt remove them, it forces them underground where you have less insight in to what they are doing, instead of seeing them out in the open so you can ridicule them and expose their ideas to criticism.</div>

    <div class="md">No one is saying they want to spread hate. 


But, it's pretty fucked that your version of hate is:

"Gee, I support trans people, but I don't think they should be competing in sports against biological women"


"I have no problem with trans folks, I just wouldn't date someone who has/had a penis."</div>
