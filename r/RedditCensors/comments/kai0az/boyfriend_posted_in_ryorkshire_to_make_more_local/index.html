    <div class="md">Two messages is spam now? It's funny how ANGRY mods get when you message them any sort of questions. They either don't respond, or get super pissed and condescending. I looked at their rules and they don't have anything against making posts like your bf did, someone even made a similar post a couple weeks ago, "anyone else from brighouse?", and that guy's post stayed up. Also if you don't know about it /r/playdate might be a better sub for your bf to find gaming friends</div>

    <div class="md">It's so frustrating. He messaged to ask why he got permabanned instantly instead of getting his post deleted and a warning, and got muted instantly. I looked on the sub too and a guy made a post 4 days ago repping his youtube and telling people to share and download. Self promotion is classed as spam on that sub, but that's still up.</div>
