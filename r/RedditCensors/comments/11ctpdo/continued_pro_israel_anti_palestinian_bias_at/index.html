      <div class="md">Just last week over 11 Palestinians were killed by israel and barely any posts were allows on worldnews and elsewhere. 

Yet today multiple stories about two settlers being killed have been run. 

Most pro Palestinian posters, or even posters criticizing israel, have been banned. 

Zero context that the two killed were actually settlers in Occupied Palestine. 
Zero context that these killings follow two months of continuous raids, attacks and home demolitions by israeli troops and settlers.

Zero context about over four dozen Palestinians murdered by settlers and israeli troops in the past two months. 

And in the comments pro israelis are allowed to dominate the posts with blatant lies and hate speech, while, due to being banned, there is virtually zero questioning their narrative.

    <div class="md">Good little Zionazi troll, keep making yourself look like an idiot so you can pretend israelis aren’t terrorist land thieves. 

Sooooo brave…. Using the weapons the US gives you to murder people and steal their land. 

Anyone who has ever met an israeli quickly realizes why they are universally hated and considered the rudest and most supremacist people on earth. 

Sucks to suck. 

Super brave with your troll account.</div>

    <div class="md">Hate to break it to you, there are many many Jews that also recognize what little dick, insignificant cowards Zionists are.  

So cute you think your name calling scores you any points. 

How many troll accounts do you have to burn through to online harass people?

You should seek mental health treatment and maybe get a hobby. 

Again, I only bother responding to you because you really are a perfect example of a pro israel troll. 

Fake account. Immature. Instant name calling. Incapable of actually discussing any relevant issues. 

You’ll troll until your account is banned then you’ll make another account and do it again. 

Really a sad life.  But hey, most Zionists are sad, weak little people, so you’re nothing special there. 

Enjoy your trolling!

Gotta go do grown up things you wouldn’t be able to relate to.</div>

    <div class="md">The Israel/Palestine topic is constantly being entrenched and manipulated in US/world politics.  

Those guys in that region of the world have been fighting for thousands of years, and will probably continue to do so for thousands more.  It's always the same stuff about how a building that gets bombed for being a missile launch site is a daycare, or the neighborhood full of children that gets ravaged was taking pot shots at the other guys, and someone rushes in to throw a baby between a suicide bomber and a checkpoint so they can make the baby a martyr.   Sort of like "eat or be eaten".   I doubt we ever hear the full story in any of these situations that flare up.  They all try to pander to the world media for being the "better guy", and the truth may never be known.  To any outsider, getting involved seems to be like punching a tar-baby.</div>

    <div class="md">Sorry, but I have to counter your characterization of the israel-Palestine issue. 

The narrative on thus has been dominated by the US and israel up until social media allowed locals and local journalists to tell their own story (this happened around 2014 when israel slaughtered 2200 Palestinians in Gaza over 50 days).

It hasn’t been ‘thousands of years of fighting’. The fighting began when the Zionist movement began systematically taking over the land and expelling its residents in the 1890s. 

And your portrayal of Palestinians as throwing babies, suicide bombers and using civilian places as launching sites is pure Zionist propaganda. 

Palestinians have been denied 99% of building permits since the 1970s by israel, so israel routinely destroyed and structures built by Palestinians (including their homes) for being built without a permit. At the same time settlers and Israelis have been permitted to build wherever and whenever they like. 

Please speak accurately.</div>

    <div class="md">Funny, you seem to be only focused on responding to extremely bigoted descriptions of Palestinians as terrorists to use their babies to attack innocent Jews as being abrasive, but not the ones who make such bigoted comments in the first place. 

Maybe check your inherent bias?

And for reference, one sub I was banned on (run by Zionists) banned by for ‘misinformation’ and then for not agreeing with the moderators when I countered the often repeated claim that Palestinians started the war by pointing out that large scale military assaults were began by Zionists the same week the British withdrew and that israel wasn’t ’immediately attacked by ‘five neighboring countries’, but in reality Zionists had been massacring local Palestinians for months before neighboring nations got involved. 

The Deir Yassin massacre is perfect evidence of this timeline.

I keep it very factual.

Yet on the other side the pro israel group routinely calls all Palestinians ‘terrorists’ who are innately violence and want to kill all Jews. 

The pro israel bias and anti Palestinian hate speech is common.  


There are multiple reports across Reddit of people being accused by worldnews of ‘terrorist apologia’ for criticizing israel.</div>

    <div class="md">I would have answered earlier but after being harassed by the other user who harassed me repeatedly here and across multiple others subs, I got banned from Reddit for seven days, without reason or example of any posts I made.

So yes, the pro israel groups absolutely work to control the public perception and the media. 

Broadly speaking many Reddit groups control the public perception and narrative of their subs based on their own agendas. 

Regarding israel specifically, israel literally has groups line the Hasbara fellowship which they spend millions of dollars on every year to organize and train students, religious groups and their soldiers to monitor social media and control public perception via flooding their comments sections with pro israel posts, attacking and banning other posters who are criticizing israel and becoming moderators. 

Feel free to research “Hasbara”. It isn’t a secret, they have their on Facebook page. 

I requested multiple times for the Reddit admins to tell me why I was banned for a week and never received a reply. 

The only posts I had made prior to the ban were in response to the user here calling me a nazi and harassing me across multiple subs. 

I think that is evidence in itself.</div>

    <div class="md">That is definitely part of it, but they specifically censor anyone posting stories that show israelis brutalizing Palestinians and comments defending Palestinians or criticizing israel.

It’s way more than SJWing.

Forget about questioning trans ideology, even saying maybe children should be deciding they need elective surgery on their genitalia. 

Forget about pointing out that while Russia isn’t Good, Ukraine isn’t necessarily innocent of all wrongdoing either.

There are specific opinions beyond SJWing that they do not tolerate being questioned.</div>

    <div class="md">USA and Israel are tight with military intelligence, so It's not surprising they may get a bit more leeway with the media.  Still, I wouldn't be happy if Hamas were in my backyard firing missiles at me from buildings like daycares, or hospitals just so any counter attack at that point would look bad.  Then again, I wouldn't be happy if I had someone demolish my home just because I was the wrong religion.  I'm sure the USA loves the fact that they have a way to test all the new-fangled war technology, and Israel loves to have the iron dome, and to show their thanks by helping to develop stuff like stuxnet.  I don't see this relationship changing any time soon.</div>

    <div class="md">There is a lot of propaganda out there on all sides. 

I’m fine for legitimate discussions, but that includes pointing out misinformation.

Didn’t mean YOU were propagandistic, which is why I specified that I was talking about the portrayal of Hamas.

Sorry if I was blunt and it sounded like a personal attack.

After you hear the same miss characterizations, that you know are false, being intentionally repeated over and over by one side or another and it gets challenging to not be blunt…</div>

    <div class="md">It isn’t what I ‘feel’, it’t reality based on fact.

Pro israel groups flood media with comments about ‘Hamas firing thousands of rockets into israel’ yet fail to discuss actions of israel which prompted the response by Hamas - last year’s attacks on Al Aqsa and evictions in Sheik Jarrah are prime examples.  

Similarly IDF a cure every Palestinian they murder as being a ‘terrorist’ yet never prove anything.smevwith their bogus claims of ‘firing from hospitals’. Meanwhile in the2014 slaughter of Gaza israel targeted and destroyed multiple hospitals and other vital infrastructure.  IDF routinely murder journalists and fire at ambulances while preventing ambulances from tending to the people they just shot.

This isn’t the forum to go into detail, but feel free to post on israel_palestine for a more full discussion if you are really interested.</div>

    <div class="md">I already verified those things to be true, so not bogus.   You carry on like "nuh uhh, false..." or "yeah well if it is true it's because of what the others did" etc. etc. ad infinitum. 

You are just continuing to be that typical one-sided banter for what is essentially two cats with their tails tied together, and thrown over a clothsline.   

All I get from you again is that you hate Israel, and love Palestine, and say anything you can to support that narrative.   By all means,  you're entitled to your opinion, but because of that, you're not someone I would curate for any semblance of the truth about that topic.</div>

    <div class="md">I’d love to see how you ‘verified’ those claims. I strongly suspect they are ‘verified’ by ‘the IDF said so.

I’ve actually been closely following this for over a decade and researching it.

But sure, go ahead with your own ‘nuh uhh…false… you just hate israel’ argument.

You really seem to have zero interest in actual facts or history.

Again, this sub is for discussion of censorship issues.

If you care to move the conversation about what a POS country israel,is to a more appropriate forum, I’m happy to give you verifiable information that you can take or ignore as you chose, but given your response here, I doubt you are asking questions in good faith.</div>

    <div class="md">Thanks. This is a subject I follow and people are free to have opposing opinions, but I have been surprised at how every major group on Reddit that supposedly exists for ‘news’ is actually heavily censoring any criticism of israel and manipulating public perception through only allowing one viewpoint in the comments. 

I have no doubt that this level of censorship happens on many other subjects, but like anything, one only becomes aware of it when it effects someone directly or is experienced.</div>

    <div class="md">Have you seen the Zionist here openly harassing me because I posted that there is censorship and manipulation on behalf of israel?

They have harassed me across three different subs. Their account is a one day old burner account and they have done nothing but post personal insults no pro israel propaganda. 

I see posts line that all the time with zero recourse. 

Yet I and others have been immediately banned for responding to them calmly with verifiable facts.

    <div class="md">You are definitely right. The problem is that Reddit falsely portrays itself as an open forum without being honest that it facilitates misinformation and propaganda while actively silencing certain viewpoints. 

It should be forced to be one or the other. 

It is one thing if the bias of a sub is inherent in the title and description, but so many subs are dishonest about their purpose and moderation. 

I’m fine with biased subs being biased, but a sub that represents itself as a news sub, and facilitates discussion about the news, shouldn’t be allowed to misrepresent its actual censorship and manipulation of public discourse.</div>

    <div class="md">Actually that’s rapidly changing. That is the perception though, since social media is manipulated (through bans allowing pro israel comments dominating the comments sections and posting biased stories). 

When israel was formally declared an Apartheid government, worldnews and others took down almost every post about it. 

Plus israel organizes groups to troll social media 24 hours per day and get Zionists as mods.</div>

    <div class="md">This is jaded and not accurate take. Yeah, sure there’s a lot of what your describing but it’s not all that. People are being censored on Reddit for all kinds of reasons and this is the only place I’ve seen discussion about it from time to time. You said you’re just here to witness it but you’re just spreading a mischaracterization of the sub, when you’re going to bother to comment you should just engage and try to make it a better place. Basically, put up or shut up instead of loudly complaining.</div>

    <div class="md">If you scroll through the last ~10 posts across ~20 days 2 of those posts maybe 3 could be considered not a banning of actual hateful content. So I would say this sub still swings a particular way. I'm not complaining I like cooking here and commenting on their dumbass posts. Pissing off the right wing snowflakes and watching them melt. It's fun.</div>
