    <div class="md">Basically, you can have the opinions that I agree with, and you are encouraged to discuss them. But if you have a differing opinion then that's *racist* and you get banned. What a bunch of butt hurt douchers.

Update! There's another thread with the movie poster. Same story here. Locked thread. https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ca8il7/disneys_mulan_official_teaser_poster/</div>

    <div class="md">So the stickied comment from a mod is:

&gt;I am locking this before this escalates even further.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you make racist comments in this sub, you will be permanently banned without warning.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please take this as an opportunity to look over our rules [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/about/rules/).

&amp;#x200B;

I read through all of the mod deleted comments and didn't see anything racist at all. There were lots of comments saying that the character should have been black, but nothing racist. The only slurs I could find were from a comment talking about the names their Japanese-American friend got called growing up in Kansas. I suppose there were also two instances of "nigga", one self deleted, one mod deleted. those could be construed as racist, but I'd say pretty mildly and hardly worth a sticky and locking the thread.

Also, their rules don't say anything about racism, only hate speech, and with no definition of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes mods remind me of Don Quixote, tilting at windmills, fighting isms that aren't really there.</div>
