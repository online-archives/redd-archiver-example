/u/PolarpopsK is nakedly an alt of barawo33, former top mod of /r/MarchAgainstTrump; when he controlled that sub, he used the exact same tactics.

But what's notable here is not that someone is vote-manipulating reddit. What's notable is that the admins know (they keep suspending his accounts one after the other), but the subreddit itself is never penalized. Not even when it's the top mods' multiple alts that do it. The reason is obvious: the admins are ok with anti-Trump subs gaining visibility through prohibited means, and they ban this guy's alts to keep up appearances.

Let's remember that the_donald was punished for using stickies, a built-in function of reddit, to promote its own content. Yet these people organize brigades off-site and they're only punished by losing worthless burner accounts.</div>

Their use of bots and bullshit is so blatant it's disgusting.
