Also, there are photos showing that guy welding a baton. I can't say who started what or who was acting defensively, but painting him as some random old guy who was attacked for no reason doesn't really fit.</div>

    <div class="md">You said you applaud violent authoritarianism. Antifa are fascists. They try and pretend they are not, and that they oppose "fascism", instead they are just another sect of violent authoritarians that are intolerant of others and use violence to express that intolerance.

&gt; They are delusional and some seem to be either mentally incapacitated or brain damaged, or just low-IQ, really no surprise there.

You are revealing yourself to be a bigot. Why do you have so much hate inside you?</div>

Your words. Support of violent authoritarian thugs. Those are the people you aligned yourself with. .

    <div class="md">Just came across this video that shows that this guy wasn't just some bystander but someone who willfully got involved in street violence. Again, it's not clear who started what, but he clearly goes back looking for more after the initial fight has broken up. That's when he gets smacked in the head. He wasn't randomly jumped by the crowd.

    <div class="md">Look at this thread, for one, from Rose City Antifa:  https://twitter.com/161EUG/status/1145849968420220928

They even set up a donation page "to help the arrested and injured anti-fascists who helped defend Portland".  That entire thread is a long string of tweets explaining why the attack on Andy Ngo was justified.  The same thread contains justifications and pictures for the attack on that old man, because apparently he was carrying a baton around and making threats.  

The AlwaysAntifa twitter page has much the same.

Gee, guess it was Antifa after all.</div>

    <div class="md">Look, you're trying to straddle a pigsty fence in an attempt to stay clean.

It's clear from your comment that you think violence is fine against anyone you define as a fascist. Here's something that may come as a shock to you, Trump and his supporters oppose fascism. That's why he was elected.

You're also trying to claim that it might not be antifa perpetuating this. What else does antifa do than wear masks and beat up people they call fascists? And when they do exactly that, you claim that no one can prove who it is, because they were wearing masks.</div>

    <div class="md">Saying you are not against fascism does not make you Antifa. Antifa has a flag, name designation. If these people say they are Antifa would you consider them part of that group? 

Here is some information on the Antifa group

Apart from the Flag and name a core ideal is direct action.</div>

    <div class="md">**Antifa (United States)**

The Antifa () movement is a conglomeration of left-wing autonomous, militant anti-fascist groups in the United States. The principal feature of antifa groups is their use of direct action, with conflicts occurring both online and in real life. They engage in varied protest tactics, which include digital activism, property damage, physical violence, and harassment against those whom they identify as fascist, racist, or on the far-right.Activists involved in the movement tend to be anti-capitalists and subscribe to a range of ideologies, typically on the left. They include anarchists, socialists and communists along with some liberals and social democrats.

    <div class="md">No it would not make everyone a murderer but it would make part of the right wing violent and that should be condemned. So yes part of the right wing would be murderers. Now in my opinion the right wing is a much more broad term than Antifa and you should let me know if you disagree. That would be like assuming everyone in the left wing agreed with the Antifa organization. Antfia is much more, like you mentioned earlier, like a small group called the proud boys. I feel like that comparison is more fair. If the Proud boys perpetrated acts of violence i would condemn them. 

If these people say they are from Antifa, would you condemn them. Do you condemn them period and if they do turn out to call themselves Antifa would you consider them as such.</div>

    <div class="md">That's like saying "anonymous didn't hack that, there's no anonymous central command" about a website defaced by "we do not forget, we do not forgive". If they identify as antifa by dressing up as black bloc, and aren't in any way stopped by the other antifas there, and there where precedences of antifa doing that kind of shit (after all, the bike lock guy was caught) then that's enough evidence unless any to the contrary surface.  

If you see a bunch of bald guys with swastika tattoos and army boots beating up a black kid, is your first reaction "maybe they were antifa with sharpie tattoos just doing that as a false flag to make nazis look bad"?</div>

    <div class="md">Dude... Antifa has a pretty well known history of  [wearing black](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/who-are-the-antifa),  [covering their faces](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/X56rQkDgd0qqB7R68t6t7C/seven-things-you-need-to-know-about-antifa), and [violently attacking people.](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/18/us/unmasking-antifa-anti-fascists-hard-left/index.html)  You are either being intentionally facetious or you were produced with batteries not included. Like everyone on the left likes to default to: if it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck... then it's probably not *unreasonable* to *assume* it's a duck. I don't need to conduct an in depth DNA and environmental analysis to make that conclusion. If I saw a bald guy wearing skinny jeans, a leather jacket, and Doc Martens with a tattoo of the black sun and Celtic cross on his neck beating some guy in the head, I'd probably think that dude's a Nazi. You would, too. Sure, there's the slim chance the dude is just a normal guy who dresses like an old punk rocker and maybe has those tats for religious reasons, but let's be real. We're tossing a solid wager.

That said, whether their violence is justified is a completely different argument. We are definitely missing some context, and can only gather so much from a short clip of film, but the pieces we do have seem to fit.

If you need any more help with trying to understand this, I can look for some crayons.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;So you honestly think Antifa are the ones in favor of genocide and racism? That's very ridiculous and uninformed of you.

Those aren't "fascist" policies, they are just policies of evil regimes. Pol Pot is the perfect example that racism and genocide know no political affiliation.

They are fascist because they are intolerant of views, their actions show them to be exclusionary and want to centralize power to only the "faithful". They attempt to violently suppress their political opponents. They are violent authoritarians.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;&gt; They are fascist because they are intolerant of views

And attempt to push their ideology through violence.


&gt;What views are "Antifa" intolerant of? Ohhhh.. just intolerance, hate, genocide, bigotry, all the typical white nationalist things, and the fascism that comes with it. 

And free market liberalism. Black bloc protesters regularly attend G8 and G20 meetings and bring along their violence.


&gt;Intolerance of intolerance is not intolerance. You may think Antifa are fascists, but that's being very disingenuous. By your logic then we have two groups of fascists battling each other. Only one side is doing it from a position of actual hate of "the other". 

No. One is from a position of hatred of racial groups another is of hatred of economic and political class.

&gt;If there weren't hateful ideology behind the fascism of white nationalism, then there wouldn't be Antifa. There simply wouldn't be any reason for it to exist.

Yes there would. Antifa doesn't only "combat" white nationalists and fascism they also "combat" capitalism and globalism. Antifa are violent authoritarians.</div>

&gt;Oh really. Maybe they just don't put up with hate and bigotry and actual fascism and are sick and tired of right-wingnuts being the only ones that use violence. I applaud them for risking their lives in the interest of a better world - one where hate and bigotry is not tolerated. Tolerance of intolerance is not tolerance, it's foolishness.

You applaud violent authoritarianism? That would make you a fascist. Are you also a racist? You might be seeing so much white supremacy around because you are projecting onto others what is in your heart. Don't judge people by the color of their skin but the content of their character.

&gt;If there weren't hateful violent ideology behind the fascism of white nationalism, then there wouldn't be Antifa. There simply wouldn't be any reason for it to exist.

Incorrect. They would find a new excuse to violently promote their ideology (like they did at the WTO conferences and the G20 and G8 conferences). They are violent authoritarians.</div>
