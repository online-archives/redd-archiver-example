 Idk. Maybe I'm wrong. It just seems sort of outrageous as a casual user. It was literally just a trending post that got pot on my homepage. I didn't even engage in whatever the main conversation was. It was just some random, "but um actually" I felt the need to post like all of us random humans. 

 Not a fan. Was I wrong? Seems abit heavy handed.</div>

    <div class="md">Instagram isn't any better, I got my comment removed and a temporary ban last week.

I asked a question to a local senator about mail in ballots for the state primary for my older aunt who is sick and Instagram, less than 2 minutes after posting, removed my comment and put 3 pop-ups about it on my screen. The first one was saying the comment was spam, the second saying it was political misinformation which had the words mail in ballots in the comment highlighted and the third saying it was "hate speech" and all the comment said was "Mr. Senator can you please point me toward the place to help my Aunt apply for a mail in ballot for the upcoming primary since she is ill and will be having surgery 3 days before?" and then my account was banned for getting 3 strikes for a 48 hour period.</div>

    <div class="md">You think that’s bad.

I got permanently banned on Instagram for saying someone deserves to have a brick thrown at their head. Why did I say that?

A women posted a video about she was r-word, and how she has finally recovered. Someone on a clear burner account commented “the guy who did it was lucky and should have got a prize because you are so pretty”. His comment is still up.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm sure you're familiar with their "country club" threads?

BPT discourse is a lesson in [Motte and Bailey fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) 

They consistently engage in black supremacist talking points, racist conspiracy theories, and encouragement of illegal activity. They'll cloak the most egregious threads under the "country club" threads in which only users which have sent in a picture of their skin to a moderator are permitted to comment; with the implied objective of keeping out undesirables, mostly commenters deemed to be nay-saying Whites.

The whole sub hides behind their self ascribed claim of satire to provide the Motte to their super racist Bailey.</div>

    <div class="md">Probably why they hate this community, lol.... 200% deserved.  These post when they get pushed on me just make me realize how normal i am. Not cuz people here, cuz communities like OP being crazy as shit like that. 

Anyways love everyone here and hope OP encourages more people join that community just to comment in random place just keep their mod team busy as fuck! lol</div>

    <div class="md">I had that happen. We were discussing something about the history of N. Africa and Western Asia, and when I "won" the argument (because he was just saying things he saw on reddit rather than anything factual) his response was something akin to (keeping it SFW): "*well good luck with that MAGA boy, once you get Trump into office all your dreams will come true*"

We never once brought up Trump or American politics. He just dropped that little number and blocked me lol.</div>

    <div class="md">Can you losers do anything other than blame liberals

A little internet troll club bans people and republicans act like it’s destroying democracy.

Meanwhile republican politicians have closed door meetings to write laws for our country and nobodies allowed to even know what they talk about and that’s just totally fine.

All republican can do is point fingers at liberals, “ohh there being mean to me on the internet”

What a snowflake.</div>

    <div class="md">Those existing laws written in by republicans to protect republicans? Yeah, of course.

Yeah totally fine when it involves our laws and democracy but breaking the reddit rules is a no go.

You don’t have a platform, so you come here. Ya’ll know exactly what you’re doing.

How many people do you think have been banned from r/askaconservative or r/conservative for the same shit?

You’ll whine all fucking day about one side doing it on the internet but just close your eyes when it’s your side or even elected officials doing it in front of all of our faces.

What a joke.</div>

    <div class="md">A post called “conservative” bans people based on political ideology who post on the subreddit and doesn’t ban people from “enemy” subs.

Vs.

A subreddit called “WPT” which isn’t inherently political that bans people for posting on other subs they deem their enemies.

Nobody is saying you can’t ban people, but banning people who have never interacted with the sub purely based on affiliations with subs they perceive as problematic is stupid.

Imagine defending turbo janitors… which subs do you mod for?</div>

    <div class="md">As much as I love arguing with Democrats, you are correct about that. Since I am a lifelong devout libertarian it really doesn’t hurt me to say that conservatives have a tendency to behave in a reactionary manner these days. They mean it in a “how does it feel vibe” but it comes off more like a “I’m a jerk” vibe. However, in examples, you and every other leftist has only really been able to point to that one Reddit whereas I can point dozens of examples offhand that practice this on the left side.
The problem is that left takes any criticism of their constant virtue signaling as offensive and mean, but they have no problem, turning around and engaging in the exact behaviors that they complain about us doing 50 years ago, and to tell you the truth comes off to nearly everybody is complete and absolute hypocrisy</div>

    <div class="md">You guys need to understand this  


ANYONE who shifts the narrative or the flow of conversation in a thread from what it currently exists as, will be eliminated. These forums are carefully curated, its not a natural environment. You are coming in with your questions and comments and throwing off their ecosystem  


If why you are being banned for stuff like this doesn't make sense its because you are only looking at these forums and the moderators as they are presenting themselves and not for what function they are serving</div>

    <div class="md">All it took was 1 comment for the mods to ban me. Funny part is that I called them out for banning people for engaging in other subs and their copout excuse was “Maybe don’t engage in subs that actively break Reddits ToS”…

I wonder if WPT wants to be pot or kettle? lol</div>

    <div class="md">I've *heard* of that happening in some subs...   I've been banned for stupid ridiculous BS, but not from one sub for commenting on a completely different sub.  I guess I need to up my game a bit.

Reddit is shit.  It's crack-like addiction is waning though (for me anyway), and I'm on here less and less, which is a good thing.  Reddit is still pining for an IPO, so the owners are looking for their payday.</div>

    <div class="md">Getting banned from their sub is a good thing. They're fascist, violent, racist, mob-like people with a desire to be Authortarians. They block people because they lack the cognitive ability to have conversation. 

I refuse to give that sub any attention, good or bad.</div>

    <div class="md">If you post in r/JoeRogan, you’re automatically banned from r/Justiceserved. I replied to a comment condemning Joe Rogan and was banned by association. I then replied to the auto mod explaining my thoughts about how auto banning people for which they have 0 context is a little overboard, then calling their sub stupid, to which I was reported for harassment and banned for 3 days from reddit. That made me pretty irate to say the least.</div>

    <div class="md">> and that you can get banned for posting on a subreddit(A) in subreddit(B

Yep, there are bots that scrape "undesireable" subreddits for membership and mass ban them, as an example. 

Lost both of my original accounts (one for general posting, one for adult-fun-time posting) - because White People Twitter mass-banned my adult-fun-time account because it was part of subreddits they **DIDNT APPROVE OF** (like.. you know, consensual BDSM).  

I hadn't logged in to that account in a week or three, so i didnt know that.  Then i innocently posted a reply to a White People Twitter post that had popped up on my front page on my main account.  

BAM. 

Both accounts perma-banned for "using another account to avoid a ban".  

Keep in mind, NEITHER account was part of White People Twitter and i had never deliberately posted there - only if/when it rarely popped up on my main account's feed.  

Fucking insane.</div>

    <div class="md">And they wonder why people accuse liberals of being anti free speech. Like sure, it's your subreddit, ban whoever the fuck you want, but it's not a good look, especially when you ban people for speaking out against the forms of bigotry you claim to hate. I hope the mods over at WhitePeopleTwitter touch some grass, but that's probably too much to ask.</div>

My "participation" was calling a trending page rant "bullshit". I responded by telling them to "get the fuck over themselves" and got suspended by Reddit for 3 days for harassment</div>

    <div class="md">Yeah this happened to me a lot during the pandemic. I’m very left-leaning but I found myself agreeing with the right-wingers on some of the COVID stuff like vaccine mandates. I would get perma-banned from random subreddits just for joining or commenting on some of the COVID-narrative skepticism subs. 

It’s okay if you disagree or whatever, and make fun of me all you want, but what’s the big deal? I understand the conservative movement has a lot of bigotry and leads to the fascist pipeline, but for an issue like COVID, or guns, those things aren’t related to religious or racial bigotry. They’re kind of just their own social issues that have assigned “stances” that you have to take if you’re on the right or the left. It’s so weird.</div>

So if it is, this makes it even more gold. Perma ban of the person pointing out the hypocrisy of permabanning the person who said something about the opinion of the person crying about a perma ban.

Classic.</div>

    <div class="md">Lately u have been asking to be permanently banned from subs. 

Reddit forces certain threads and ideas on you. I will ignore for so long, but eventually, I jump into a thread and "let's go."  Ultimately I get a 30 day ban or whatever. 

Doesn't matter if I mute the threads, block the post, ask for different posts. They keep showing up on my feed. Even stuff i was temp banned from. 

Only way I found to solve it is to ask mods to permanently ban me from subreddits. 

Honestly it has really cleaned up my feed.</div>

Any sub that bans you for talking in another sub is just trying to push an agenda and make an echo chamber. They really think they’re making a difference 😂

    <div class="md">Why does Reddit, which is recently far more interested in monetizing user engagement, tolerate mods who brick part of the product because users engaged with the product? 

I think the management would respond to pressure on this because it is so contrary to their aims of inviting users to click, read and comment.  Not to mention the obvious insanity of requiring certain political stripes just to be allowed to participate in many communities.</div>
