    <div class="md">The new one I've seen is a bunch of Biden supporters calling any criticism of Biden "BDS".  

Clown world is hilarious sometimes when it's not sad.

Yes /r/politics has been an echo chamber since at least like... 2015? Yes it is blatant censorship and oppression, but don't let the "guardians of freedom" know that.</div>

    <div class="md">That’s what I’m talking about. You make up all these weird names and act like he’s a serial killer or something. That’s what tds is, you freak out when you hear his name about anything. I already said I don’t like him in both posts. 

It’s just hearing his name that makes your brain freak out and make up childish names and act like he’s hitler or some other hyperbole. “Tangerine shitgibbons”, do you think people who talk like that because they hear a name don’t have mental problems? I would argue only an asshat talks like that.

I can say someone has tds without liking trump and if I did like trump I should be able to say it in a politics sub, that is the point. Try not to have another breakdown.</div>

    <div class="md">He was a corrupt disaster that told a bunch of assholes that have been brainwashed by years of right-wing lies exactly what they want to hear. He lied about the election being stolen which has caused a giant rift in our country because people want so badly to believe they’ve abandoned reality. The one good thing he has done is removed the masks from so many people that are willing to compromise everything about themselves for the promise of power. On the topic of masks though, coincidentally those same people refused to take proper precautions and died in disproportionate numbers from Covid; I’m mad at them for being so awful but I’m not mad at reality for asserting consequences.</div>
