    <div class="md">They censored this, despite 1500 upvotes and OP replying, thanking the user for the response. And of course despite no rules being broken. Fuck these mods:

answer: She's an outspoken feminist and woman.

The furore originated primarily because of this comment she made about "The shape of the water".

She disclosed how, “of the 100 highest-grossing movies in 2017, less than a quarter of the critics were white women, less than ten percent were underrepresented men, and only 2.5 percent were women of color.”

Recognizing that “reviews change lives” and the impact which films are considered for awards season, Larson called for more inclusive representation in the industry. “Am I saying I hate white dudes?” the Oscar-winner asked the room at the Beverly Hilton. “No, I’m not,” she replied.

“I don’t want to hear what a white man has to say about ‘A Wrinkle in Time.’ I want to hear what a woman of color, a biracial woman has to say about the film. I want to hear what teenagers think about the film.”

“If you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is a chance that a woman of color does not have access to review and critique your film,” she said, while revealing plans to roll out an opt-in program that will provide studios with access to underrepresented journalists and critics. “Do not say the talent is not there, because it is.”

https://variety.com/video/brie-larson-crystal-lucy-awards-critics/

Now , in context that statement is very easy to understand. Brie Larson was upset that a movie targetted to a certain demographic would not be reviewed by that demographic, but by older white men.

Out of context, the statement has been used to paint Brie Larson as an evil SJW who hates white people.

That your brother hates her is not caused by whatever actions she did, but the social media and news environment he surrounds himsekf with. In certain sections of tge internet, she's used as a bogeyman.</div>

    <div class="md">Has nothing to do with her being a woman, or a feminist really.

It has to do with her being a massively sexist and racist bigot. 

She kept harping on the "not saying I hate white men" like FIVE TIMES... it was obviously her trying to be snarky. 

Plus she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. At least, her "performance" in the Marvel movies was totally wooden. The cast all disliked her in person too, unsurprisingly.

/outoftheloop is a total shit show nowadays. Half of the crap there is nothing but rabid leftist / Shareblue political propaganda.  The rest is bullshit like this. 

Sad really, it was an OK sub until Shareblue took over.  :/</div>
