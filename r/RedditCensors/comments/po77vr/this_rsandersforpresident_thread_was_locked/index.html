    <div class="md">Alternative title, "What happens when your propaganda doesn't have the desired effect."

AOC attended a $30K a ticket event at the MET with a dress that read "Tax the Rich" and when people came down hard on her the sub was locked to prevent further commenting and most of the comments critical of her were removed. Pretty hilarious stuff. Even more interesting than the fact AOC didn't donate her $30K ticket she was "gifted" and use the money to help the poor is that AOC and none of the celebrities are wearing masks, I'm guessing because masks clash with their hundred thousand dollar clothes, while the wait staff and journalists, the help, are wearing masks. Rules for thee, not for me, huh? I wonder, did they have a sign like at a theme park roller coaster with a furry mascot cutout holding a hand over a stack of money with a word balloon that says, "If you have THIS MUCH money you can not wear a mask!"

I wonder, will AOC be required to pay taxes on that $30K gift she was given? And I wonder how much that dress cost to make? Imagine how many soup kitchens could have been financed with that money. Imagine how much she could've helped her abuela with that money.

I just find it amazing that people are still at this point hoisting this person up as a hero, and when they lose the narrative because people point out the utter hypocrisy of a person like AOC who lives in a luxury apartment complex, who went from a poor bartender to a wealthy politician over night, attending an event filled with celebrities, dressing like she is a celebrity, not wearing a mask despite forcing others to wear masks, they lock the post. They lock the post, shut down conversation, remove comments, not because the subscribers to that sub are upset by her hypocrisy, but because the post became "popular" and "some people are very upset" and voiced their opinion that AOC is a grifter, and then provided evidence to support the claim.</div>

"You just don't get it, she makes good money now she is allowed to have luxury apartments with private massages and infinity pools, don't hate on her because she is successful!"

Yeah. The lack of self-awareness on the part of *some people* is pretty comical and depressing.</div>

    <div class="md">Oh, don't get me wrong. Maybe the fault is in how I said what I said... I don't have a problem with people having all those things either, but like you said to dictate to others what to do, then to openly and brazenly defy their own dictates, is totally fucked up.

As for what is wrong with them, people are stupid and desperately want to believe someone cares and that they are a part of something, and politicians are frauds. So, the frauds manipulate the stupid people with emotional rhetoric and distract them from how they're getting fucked and used.</div>

I've been saying this about these "progressives" for years. They use rhetoric to get people desperate to believe someone cares to give them money and power, and then they continue to use rhetoric to distract those people while pointing the finger at the other team crying "Racist! Nazi!" in the hope no-one notices. They are so successful with this that they've managed to convince at least half the United States that anyone who points out how fraudulent they are is a racist Nazi. The Blue Team, Red Team binary way of thinking is a way to control the herd and keep them fighting and distracted so they never notice both sides are fucking them.</div>

    <div class="md">I mean, ok, the puppet with the stupid dress isn't really "rich".

Her parents are very well off, and she now lives off taxpayer money, because she made a casting call and got placed in  her job to play a roll.

Those she works for are VERY rich though, and are funded by even more  wealthy. So, the hypocrisy is enormous.  And their shallow propaganda, having their puppet AOC wear something like this, is very obvious. 

Seems people are NOT falling for this virtue signally bullshit as much as they use to be. Even if they don't know [how AOC got that job.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/014/040/theporncouch.jpg)</div>
