    <div class="md">If I remember correctly the Byzantine Empire was devastated from fighting other wars and knew for certain it was only a matter of time before the Turks decided to join in and decimate them. It's what the Turks had been on-again off-again doing for 300 years prior so it was a no brainer what was going to happen. Hence the first crusade was a preemptive strike and was mostly a failure. 

The 2nd crusade was to retake Jerusalem and in that one an army of 10k crusaders got unnecessarily/brutally violent and that's where the whole stigma of the crusades comes from. The army had a similar mentality of the US in WWII when we dropped an atomic bomb on a civilian population and killed 100k civilians: they started the fight by violently taking the holy land so send a message to end the fight once and for all. Their actions where still condemned at the time by the nations who sent them though. 

The other ~7 crusades were pretty much no big deal as they were justified "tit for tat" campaigns and "humane"

It's dishonest to compare the crusades with Islamic violence. There's vast differences in violence and valid justifications for conflict.

    <div class="md">Votes, and excuses.

Votes are straightforward. Excuses are more roundabout. Want to wage a cultural war on ideals you dislike? Use muslims as a proxy - have them complain about the Christian or even simply western-imperialist roots of this sign, this holiday, this value, and soon it will be removed "so we all feel welcome".</div>

    <div class="md">I got permanently banned for saying that, with obvious jokingness and sarcasm, the following:

[in reply to someone saying "Now can we accept that white people can be terrorists too?"]

"Only if you accept that whiteophobia is the real enemy here, and join me in acknowledging that white people who are going to suffer from the backlash are the real victims of this. Whiteness is a race of peace. Attacks against Muslims are the new normal and are part and parcel of living in a big city. #DontLookBackInAnger

In all seriousness though fuck him, what he did is terrorism. Fortunately I haven't seen even a single person say it isn't."

Apparently that's enough to earn a permanent ban.</div>
