Which appears to still be there to me is apparently shadowed removed.

I messaged the mods and on of them got back to me saying he wasn't entirely sure why , but it was probably because it broke rule 2 -"straight forward". I told him that it didn't break rule number two, explained why it was a complex topic, and asked for an appeal. He didn't remove it so he doesn't want to "step on other mods actions too much" and sent the mod a message.

Naturally, the mod has not gotten back to me.

I'm sick of mods feeling power hungry. The point of shadow blocking/deleting is to remove spam or bots. I am neither. The mod should have either removed it and sent me a message, or just normally removed it.  I think we should get rid of the ability to shadow block/delete posts, this is ridiculous. It's too easy for mods to take advantage of...</div>
