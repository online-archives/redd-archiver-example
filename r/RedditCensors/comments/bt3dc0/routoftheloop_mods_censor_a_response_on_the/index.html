    <div class="md">Here's the comment they censored:

&gt;Answer: people think a video that shows all her mess ups edited together is now “fake” , after they posted the original video, it pretty much shows it’s the same thing just cut for time and impact. Dems can’t handle this then sit back and spin out of context videos themselves for the right freely without any calls for deleting Facebook prior.  
As per usual real news is now fake because it’s shining a negative light, and fake news is real because calling it fake is a “threat to democracy”. Reminds me of the disabled reporter fake story, but now it’s on the left so DeleteFacebook because we can’t control them on this one and it’s spreading too quickly and embarrassingly.

Here's the one that somehow wasn't against the rules:

&gt;Answer: A fake/doctored video attempting to discredit Nancy Pelosi (US politician, Democrat, Speaker of the House) was hosted on Facebook and viewed millions of times.  

&gt;It’s pretty obviously fake and people want Facebook to either delete the video or at the very least label the video as fake.  

&gt;They said they won’t do either.  

&gt;As a response people are deleting their Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp (Facebook owns all 3) accounts and encouraging others to do the same.</div>

    <div class="md">Its very strange.  They deleted a comment that linked a video ["Can You Trust Apple? Facebook? Google?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjLHuhOTnaI)

Is the theory that reddit is in collusion with these central companies and doesn't want any of them to lose their current power?

I guess I say strange is that the prevailing attitude is that reddit has a left political leaning, but perhaps its simply more about control and less about left right dichotomies.  I dunno, its strange.</div>

Incorrect.

The original hoopla was centered around the video that was slowed down. Now the media is conflating that obviously doctored video with another one that is simply cut up to show how Pelosi slurs and  stammers like a drunk, pill popping 80 year old. The latter video is not slowed down or modified other than editing it down for time / impact like NorseGodLoi0411's quoted comment said.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;it's pretty obviously fake

Obvious - easily perceived or understood; clear, self-evident, or apparent.

There's a massive rift where one side believes this is fake and the other definitely disagrees. If this were truly "easily perceived or understood" then there wouldn't be another side big enough to cause the controversy that we're currently seeing.

How is it biased? Fuck outta here with that shit.</div>
