Edit: what’s more infuriating is that the same i day I posted one of these, he left up a post on the sub that was a “discussion” and literally the post just said that OP loved the switch and hadn’t been that excited to game in years. Really? That’s a thought provoking discussion? You like the game system that the sub is devoted to?</div>

    <div class="md">Not necessarily. There were a lot of changes made to the game, so I listed the things I didn’t like and asked if the new changes would help someone get into the new game more than the old one. I would have posted in r/splatoon but obviously everyone there loves the game and might not have the same perspective, I was hoping to get less pro-game biased opinions. Again none of this is important but it does seem like that mod censors the sub based on what HE deems to be worthy, regardless of whether other people are interested in the topic. </div>
