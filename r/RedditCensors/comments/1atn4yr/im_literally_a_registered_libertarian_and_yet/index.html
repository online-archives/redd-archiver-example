    <div class="md">The democrats aren't involved at all. Trump was indicted by our justice systems by juries of his peers in grand juries and will be convicted by the same if he chooses jury trials. The real question is, how could anyone get this far into life without understanding how the basics of our justice system worse. And, then to follow up, why would anyone respect said person's opinion on the matter?</div>

    <div class="md">Most of the grand juries likely didn't even know who they were indicting - the suspect's name is often redacted. Many of the judges overseeing the legal proceedings are Trump appointees. 

He is [hella fucked](https://youtu.be/Y44fyh4ap7k?si=CypYsF91NxsvJq05). The feds have a conviction rate of over %95 when they indict and courts aren't far behind. Especially in RICO crimes. Prison jumper fucked. lol.</div>

The police murdered Ashli Babette and not one policeman died of any violence on that day...the democrats are shit scared of trump because if he gets in their whole FBI, CIA, court cheating asses will be toast...I'm guessing hunters laptop is now real too according to your lying puppets who covered it up... Trump has the files on all of it and they fear it! Liberal tears on election day will be divine!!!!!</div>

I guess you did counter it with the illegals you have brought in though just so they can be given a vote and in due course wreck your sanctuary cities... Yes we are voting against fascism.

    <div class="md">Interesting . . . .  Before Trump came into prominence, I never knew anybody could have around 3,500 active court case against them.  Everything from wage violations, safety violations, breeches of contract, non-payment, fraud, rape, forcible rape of a child, sex trafficking,  tax fraud and a whole host of others.   


Normally, if it was one or two prosecutors, I would agree with statements like yours.  When it both political parties here in the states, and multiple countries with multiple prosecutors for each country, all pressing civil and criminal charges.  


I'mma going to think it the guy who flim-flaming everybody, especially low IQ people.    


I don't think it going to be a problem, rumor has it Putin has ordered Tea for Trump. (dead serious, Pravada 16 Feb 2024)</div>

    <div class="md">Well, Dumptruck *is* threat to democracy. After he lost an election he cried like a bitch (which isn't the threat - just shameful) and convinced millions of people it was a conspiracy. And the fact that there was no evidence? Or all the evidence he had turned out to be fake? Just more conspiracy. Not to mention sending his mob to "fight like hell" and attempt to stop the electoral college certification.

But people are trying to imprison him because he has *broken numerous laws.*

Can you honestly say you think he hasn't broken the law?</div>

    <div class="md">Who's voting for Biden?  Not me, not the OP as they stated.  Doesn't seem like they're advocating to vote for Biden when they flat out say they're voting third party.

I disagree with the OPs argument and find the DNC to be far more dangerous to "our democracy" than Trump.  Were I not banned and saw that post I'd have stated such.</div>

    <div class="md">I’d have loved that exchange, actually. That’s what we’re supposed to do here, is bounce ideas off of each other. I do worry about a second trump presidency, much more than a continued Democratic presidency. I’ve typically ignored both and voted my conscience. I specifically reregistered libertarian and vote libertarian because ballot access will never change until the numbers are higher. Would have loved to have had a pragmatic, intellectual exchange on this topic.</div>

    <div class="md">I wouldn't go that far.  We may be getting forced out of the libertarian sub, but who we are hasn't changed.  We just have assholes wearing our name/party like a skin suit.  I'm hoping we can get it back.  

There's a whole conspiracy theory that this may be a set up to help Trump get elected as it appears the Mises takeover was funded in part by a Trump donor.  If that's the case they'll probably toss the body out the trunk after 2024 and we can revive it.  That said, the social right regularly tries to align themselves with pro-liberty movements and then corrupts them when they get enough people in the door so, who knows, they may stay.</div>

    <div class="md">No logic, I wasn’t the OP, it was a buried off-handed comment on someone else’s post. I didn’t give it a thought. I merely thought out loud. That’s why I was shocked when I got the ban and had to go back and find the offending post and ask for clarification from the mods. I won’t vote for trump, but can’t say I’ll vote for Biden - I’ll probably vote libertarian again - not that any of that should matter.</div>

    <div class="md">You’re entitled to your opinion no matter how wrong it is. I personally believe it’s the democrats who are obviously the threat to democracy through their actions. There are numerous unprecedented legal actions that are a violation of ethics but they’re the ones that don’t care about so called democracy. They lie and their supporters carry the torch. But here’s a thought OP. Neither of us are 100% correct and are just supporting the side we chose. I support Trumps policies not the man. Some people are propping up a democrat party that is making a mockery of our justice system. Both of us are allowing some issues to slide because of what we care about. Trump the man is some of the things he’s accused of but he was an amazing president because of his leadership, policies and no new wars. Biden on the other hand is a dementia puppet ruining our country. Fact is Ukraine is a money pit supporting the military industrial complex as dementia Joe and other career politicians dump money into it. This wouldn’t have happened under Trump. Our border would be secured and everything would be cheaper as we would be energy independent. It’s not that hard to understand yet…….</div>

    <div class="md">Because "threat to our democracy" is a dog whistle. They ain't talking to you or I, they are talking about a threat to the status quo. A threat to their ability to rob us with no backlash, run up the debt, and have zero accountability. It's a threat to their power, and a threat to the money being transferred from the public sector into the private hands of billionaires and special interests. It's a threat to corporate welfare and bank bailouts. A threat to foreign interests. All who hold power over our politicians. When they speak to us, it's excuses and empty promises. When they speak about democracy and threats, it's to the donor class. 

Trump was just a billionaire who got bold and cut out the middle man. He was a threat because he could care less about anyone but himself, and his rich and powerful friends. He was so apathetic that he was spilling the beans on live television on how they use the system that is designed for them, to get away with the things they do. Besides him, they all flaunt their double standards, and their second tier laws that only apply to us and not them. They make it blatant who they represent when you follow our tax dollars. 🤷🏾‍♂️</div>

    <div class="md">I used to think that was just a casual insult to throw at people, but then my dad decided he was a libertarian. After endless hours of talking to him about it and seeing the absurd logical gaps in his thinking, I started looking at the movement a bit closer.

I'd say *maybe* 10% are "true" libertarians. The rest just want rules for other people but not for them. My dad is certainly the latter.</div>

    <div class="md">I was permabanned from r/libertarian last month for the following post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/194di3m/thoughts_on_the_pending_decision/khfkuxk/

I was also muted for 28 days after I asked why I was banned (they said I violated rule 1.  

After having the mute expired, I again inquired why I was banned, and I asked to be unbanned.  Here is the response: 

> Who said that comment is what you were banned for? Regardless, your appeal has been denied under Rule 1. We consider this to be closed, so please stop messaging us.

r/libertarian is no longer libertarian, it is an authoritarian sub that practices censorship, going against what libertarianism actually means. 

Keep in mind I was subscribed to that sub for over 10 years, and participated in it quite a lot around 2016 when Gary Johnson was the nominee.  I even voted for the LP in 2012 and 2016 it all of the races that they were in, including president.</div>

    <div class="md">No. I wouldn’t say that is accurate at all. There is a lot of infighting and litmus tests, but I think the best broad brush would be [Classical Liberalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/classical-liberalism) as distinguished from [Social Liberalism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism), which is what we usually mean when we talk about Liberalism in post Great Depression America. Think of Jefferson, Rousseau, Locke, Adam Smith, Kant, Thomas Paine (Thomas Paine is often the poster child for modern libertarianism).</div>

    <div class="md">That’s part of why this ban is so frustrating. The libertarian name is being ruined by assholes who are trump shills or anarchists, and they just keep declaring an ever increasing number of people as “not libertarian”. 

It’s reminiscent of what happened to the Republican Party from the 1970s on when they started to shift away protectors of civil rights to the exclusionary “morale majority” in the name of social conservatism.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not talking about popes being sinful.

I'm talking about how multiple times in history popes have been declared heretics or even anti-popes (AKA popes of the anti-christ).

It's less about saying the papal office is fallible and more about saying that this particular pope is an agent of Satan.</div>
