      <div class="md">First of all I was told to come here my a moderator of /r/portugal. He told me this is the only place where I can explain my point of view.

Today I woke up to a notification from reddit. I opened it and it was a PM telling me I was banned. Just as simple as that. I was banned.

I reply to it, because I was genuinely confused. I was rapidly scanning my mind to try and remember a single thing I had said that might've get me banned. I'm a pretty active user on /r/soccer and never had any problems whatsoever. I ask the mod what caused my ban.

This mod kept replying in a very passive aggressive attitude with short and hollow messages. He finally says that I'm a sexist and that's what caused the ban. He somehow managed the feat of not linking me to the post he classified as sexist. I had to be the one going through my post history to try and find a single thing I had said that could've, somehow, be interpreted as sexist.

Here's the definition of "sexist": relating to or characterized by prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex.

After reading, and reading I think I finally found the post that may have caused the ban, I think it was this one [here](https://imgur.com/a/2eVShe2/).

Have in mind that I am still not completely sure if this was the post in question because the mod team wasn't able to link it to me yet. I just know it was regarding the recent Ronaldo accusations.

Here's my exchange with the moderator who banned me: https://imgur.com/a/X3ZCfKm

Meanwhile I sent a message to the mod team since I wasn't sure if everyone was able to read it. One moderator who I assume isn't the same person who issued the ban says that ban was justified and that I was portraying misogynistic ideas. Me, a misogynist. What is happening. Here's that brief exchange: https://imgur.com/a/J8dObTX

I'm utterly perplexed about this. I was suddenly banned from my most used subreddit due to a post I made that had absolutely no ill intentions attached to it. I'm open to being told how what I wrote might have been interpreted as sexist. I've shown my girlfriend and friends the post and they just laughed at how ridiculous this whole situation is. I have to make this post because I'm not able to get cohesive replies from the mod team. Bear in mind that I'm still not sure if that was the comment that caused it because they haven't been able to pin point me to it. It honestly feels like talking to a wall. I've had only one reply from another mod and it's that one in the screenshot. They didn't even tell me if my ban was a permanent one or not. I think a permanent ban should be made after a discussion between the whole mod team unless it a glaring disrespect of the rules of the subreddit.

Maybe I'm the one who is wrong, I do understand that my post may have been a silly thing to say, but most content on this reddit is silly anyways and that's why we keep returning. However everyone I showed this to said that the person who banned me needed to read a dictionary again. My main intentions with the comment were purely comedic. Replace Neymar with a famous actress and girl with man and the meaning remains. That's a pretty good way of refuting an arguable 'sexist' meaning behind it. Yes it might have been a very poor attempt at comedy (although 9 people seem to have appreciated it) but it was just that.

I want to have a fair conversation here, to listen to people's opinions and to genuinely understand if I'm in the wrong here. I might be, I'd just like to understand why if that is indeed the case. 

Being accused of something horrible like a sexist or a misogynist honestly leaves me absolutely sick to my stomach.

I ask the mod team to leave this up so that we can have a serious and fair discussion about this.

Thank you.

EDIT: There was a misunderstanding from my part, though the aggressiveness of the first mod who contacted me was out of line in my opinion. I was just trying to get an answer, not a passive aggressive attitude. I really did not mean any ill opinion ever. I also did not understand how reddit moderation worked, who could see what, what mod did what, etc. I have conversed with some of the mods and clarified it. I'm pretty sure I won't get my account back since it was permanently banned which is a shame since genuinely did not meant what they originally think I did. Oh well, this is a ruined day.</div>

    <div class="md">You're perplexed? I don't even give a flying fuck anymore, I can always make alt accounts to engage in conversation if necessary, bans mean fuckall.

This commie shitsite will have some color-calibration-lighthouse looking cheeto-diet having tranny moderator ban you for any inane thing triggering their HRT-psychosis induced PMS-temper tantrum. People hold back their honest opinions over what? Fear of some fat bitch banning you and you can't comment with your main, or that you might lose "karma"? Hah.

This site's full of dumb, insecure faggots anyway, as proven by this subreddit outing all these banhappy bitches who moderate the various subreddits. Mods are people who will never have any IRL power and thank god for that, they're the equivalent of those military ranks just above recruits who think they're hot shit 'cause they're not the bottom of the barrel, they can *moderate* subreddits, hah, just like those in the military, these mods are just IRL fags compensating their own inadequacy online. Never any real deicisive powers. Just a fag mod on some site filled with other dumb fags.</div>

    <div class="md">Paging the /r/soccer moderator team so that they can read my case since I get absolutely no response from them via messages.

/u/reyofish /u/spinney /u/PrawnSolo 

I'm trying to do the good thing here and thoroughly present my defense. I've already spent far too much time arguing against a subreddit ban but I do feel like I was not properly communicated with. I could've just used another account and keep commenting, but I'm trying to present my case and be fairly judged by all of you in order to be removed of this ban.

I already explained it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/9lllcl/i_was_banned_from_rsoccer_for_a_supposed_sexist/e77vltw/

I've already seen your point because a few of you took your time to communicate and clarify what happened and listened to my claim. I already understand it and justified why I was acting the way I did to the best of my abilities. I completely understand why the ban was issued now.

I also didn't know of the existence of /r/soccercourt.

Again, I'm truly sorry. Keep up the work.</div>

Yup we’re different people. We have different opinions and interpretations.

I had nothing to do with the ban and not all the mods leave user notes. Additionally the amount of moderator activity in the subreddit means the mods see a lot of comments, which again makes it difficult to keep track of the specific ban reasons. It’s admittedly not the best system, but that’s on the admins for the lack of mod tools.

    <div class="md">Alright, fair enough.

Have you seen exactly the comment that got him banned?

Why not just delete his comment? Why go to the extreme and ban him? One other moderator said you often just delete comments. Please explain why or how did you see enough reason to ban him for such a general example contextualized in that point of view...

Tell the rest of us so that we don't make the same mistake. 

Don't you think that banning him for such a comment isn't turning you guys into the people you often ban? I mean it is also sexism to label something as sexist when it is not.

 In a few more years people will start being banned just by referring to someone as he or she, male or female...</div>

    <div class="md">&gt; Have you seen exactly the comment that got him banned?

As I mentioned about certain moderators leaving notes, there aren't any notes on the ban, and after scrolling back a shit ton in the mod queue I still don't see his threads.  Again, gotta call out the admins for making it impossible to search mod mail.

&gt; Why not just delete his comment? Why not just delete his comment? Why go to the extreme and ban him? 

Depends on the comment and the moderator.  

&gt; Please explain why or how did you see enough reason to ban him for such a general example contextualized in that point of view...

I didn't, so I can't really answer that

&gt; Don't you think that banning him for such a comment isn't turning you guys into the people you often ban? 

Banning sexist comments does not make me a sexist.  Just as banning racist comments doesn't make me racist.

&gt; I mean it is also sexism to label something as sexist when it is not.

No, it definitely is not.  

&gt; In a few more years people will start being banned just by referring to someone as he or she, male or female...

Nope.

    <div class="md">So you're the one who first contacted me.

I'll have you know that I could not see your username, it was displayed as null, how do you expect me to know.

I was rightly pissed off at having an account banned from one of my most used subreddits, I think it is normal. I don't know if most users actually take their time, like I did, to express their case. I'm willing to bet not that many. My reaction that you portray, and rightfully so, as abuse was prompted by this reason.</div>

    <div class="md">Hi, 

This is the comment I see as removed and for which I'm assuming you were banned as I'm travelling and don't have access to modmail

&gt;Because next week some other girl who had sex with Neymar 6 years ago is going to accuse him of rape and get a doctor to diagnose her of PTSD. She is going to say that he forced himself onto her during the entire night and then a cellphone video will surface showing her grinding her backside on his junk.

Come on dude. That's a pretty scummy attitude and viewpoint to have. False rape accusations happen yes but to just assume its inherently malicious is wrong. To presume faked mental anguish is also wrong. Also from a consent standpoint, dancing with someone, even explicitly, does not presume consent

If I'd seen that comment I would have removed it as we are getting many of them on any Ronaldo post. That another mod banned you I'm not surprised at. That's all I'm going to write. </div>

    <div class="md">Dude you have to understand we are seeing tens of Ronaldo posts a day. And we are removing hundreds of comments, we really don't want /r/soccer to devolve to troll football 'rapenaldo' shit so we are taking a harsh line on what is admittedly a controversial case. So we are erring on side of caution and you can see how we would interpret that post as serious (I've personally removed a lot of comments that seriously believe what you have posted) 

If that post was made in jest (which I could understand) the tone doesn't translate well on the Internet.

I'm sorry that you are so upset about this, but I can fully understand and support the others in this. Thanks for coming to an understanding though, appreciate it</div>

    <div class="md">I have removed any comments I made regarding the Ronaldo accusations just to prevent anymore people from misinterpreting my intentions. I don't know if it's because english is not my first language and I lack a certain sensibility to correctly express the true meaning of what I'm writing, but I'll stray away from these types of posts anyways.

If in the future you decide to give me another chance, please do let me know. I quite love participating on that subreddit and it's definitely my favorite way of watching matches, to have the match thread opened and to comment the games alongside the other users. I can't promise I'll be able to follow the second account rule, but I can definitely promise that I won't make any posts that can be interpreted in such a toxic, terrible way, ever again.

I'm sorry I called your team names, I was legitimately furious since I hate the idea of having my reddit account, where I have all my interests, and saved posts attached to, for so long now completely nullified from having my main subreddit removed. That couple with what I honestly felt like a very aggressive way of communicating with me made me lose it a bit. I apologize for it and hope you can continue to fulfill your collective of objective of steering that amazing subreddit in the right way.</div>

    <div class="md">Thank you for your turnaround and understanding and for understanding why we are taking a zero tolerance line here it's nice to see. Yes - we have many users on %r/soccer for whom English is not mother tongue, which is part of its attraction and I can understand that differential. Maybe in the future we can discuss moderation principles when incidents like this occur though I think we have been quite explicit in this cass

    <div class="md">Are you joking? How does that offend anyone? He was giving an example! A perfectly contextualized example, which showed his point of view, he was clearly shit talking about people who take advantage of the rich and famous to get money using fake crime reports, we all know that that happens more often than not...

Why didn't you just deleted his comment? Why the ban?

    <div class="md">Yes, but since I clearly had trouble finding the misogynistic remark and since I'm pretty sure I posted more than once in some of those topics I was not sure which comment it was. I think it was the Neymar one which I already edited and removed the original words. I find rape disgusting and I'm positive I said several times that if Ronaldo is guilty he should pay the price.

I took the time to write that post on /r/RedditCensors because I was told to go there by a mod of another subreddit I frequently use /r/Portugal. I didn't know the origins of that subreddit but I now understand that it is mainly used by /r/The_donald trolls who got rightly banned from other subreddits. If I'd known that from the beginning I would try to find another outlet. It's just that I genuinely felt no one was being clear with me from the /r/soccer mod team.  

I tried to explain my point. I'd never go to such lengths if I had indeed meant any ill opinions with my post. The post which I think was the one that caused the ban has been edited accordingly anyways. If I indeed offended any one of you, then I apologize, I just ask that you understand why I was pissed off and why I called you what I did.</div>

That's not an official grievance subreddit or anything btw, it's just less likely to see your post sit alongside T_D trolls.

Editing a comment after you've been banned isn't really a mitigating circumstance for us.

Abusing mods because you're feeling hard done by isn't really a mitigating circumstance for us either. It would have cost you nothing to remove yourself from the interaction for a while, wait until you're calm, and then look to overturn the ban. </div>

    <div class="md">I had never been banned before, I didn't know what the process usually is. After trying to understand what caused it I went online to see how long the ban was for and I reached the conclusion that it was probably a permanent ban pretty quickly, that made me nervous about it since I first believed only the mod who was conversing with me was able to see my case and I felt like no one else could hear my case. That's why I contacted the mod team, but I felt that it took so long to get clear answers. At the time I really didn't understand the reason behind the ban. I didn't even think of not doing anything and wait a little bit before contacting the mod team.

As I said, I'm truly sorry. I've seen those threads now and the shitshow you have to deal with. I really did. 

Again, I apologize. Keep up the work.</div>

    <div class="md">&gt;I find rape disgusting and I'm positive I said several times that if Ronaldo is guilty he should pay the price.

Saying that if Ronaldo is guilty he should go to prison is a truism that distracts from the issue. No one doubts that you think rapists should go to prison. They have issues with the way you portray the intentions of women who say they've been raped. You get the difference right? </div>

    <div class="md">So here's the thing, you were banned 10 hours before the time of your post. You replied to the ban message about 1 hour before your post, and got an almost immediate reply and after two replies you were told it was for a sexist comment. It's very possible that the mod you were talking to didn't know which comment it was, but knew your ban reason. 

Given that your ban was about 13-14 hours ago it was likely someone in America who banned you and that person may have still been asleep when you started messaging the mods. The mod who was talking to you may have only seen the ban reason (sexist comment) without knowing which comment in particular was at issue. 

You can't expect perfect communication from a mod team that is spread out across the world.</div>

    <div class="md">That makes perfect sense. I never thought about it to that extent. I had no way to know, I assumed from the beginning the same mod who banned me was the one messaging me back and that the conversation was strictly viewed by that single moderator. 

I am truly sorry. I clearly made a big mess about the whole situation and it just made it even worse for me. I was completely ignorant on these matters.</div>

You might agree or you might not, but considering the topic, that is a well contextualized example of what might happen if this gets a huge amount of spotlight! 
If he had said the same thing but instead of neymar he had said Scarlett Johansson would these mods react the same way? 
We are living in an age where people cant express themselves anymore, everyone is getting offended by the simplest things nowadays...

And these mods, jesus! what kind of justification is that? Where is the link to the actual comment or comments?? You can't ban someone without at least showing exactly what they did wrong!

    <div class="md">Alright, so, I'm one of his friends and he has shown me both the comment and the conversation with the moderators.

It's just absolutely ridiculous when the moderators think that the comment is both sexist and misogynist. The comment was a very poor comedy attempt to discuss the issue with a ridiculous comparision between Neymar and a famous actress to the situation that CR7 is living rn. You can blame him all you want if the comment was inappropriate or if the joke was bad, but there's nothing against that in the rules of that said subreddit. Therefore, there's nothing to conclude but this whole process being an absolute joke and unfair. I've seen far worse comments, like users offending one other users due to their football preferences or even far worse comedy comments (that could easily be seen as both sexist and misogynist but weren't) and this situation is not even comparable.

If that's how  [/r/soccer](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer) manages their subreddit, i'm truly disappointed. But then again, I'm not. Perhaps it's a desperate attempt to lead by example or that moderator woke up in the wrong side of the bed.</div>

    <div class="md">I got permanently banned from r/soccer as well for “hostility, sexism and abuse” just because I call bullshit on the documents and think the woman wants a money top-up. 

They muted me from mod chat and refused to explain how violated the rules or was hostile, sexist or abusive. 

The majority of reddit is a far-left cesspool that immediately assumes rape accusation = truth (as seen by the adoption of the #MeToo movement). The way Ronaldo is being treated is disgusting, his reputation is being tarnished with no evidence. 

He won’t be found guilty and subsequently will not go to prison. But this doesn’t matter since reddit has already deemed him guilty already, future threads will be plagued with shitty, repetitive rape jokes. 

But yeah, the woman is somehow the victim after receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars and most likely, will get even more. 

&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vzSRcsFV5DQ

Furthermore, the alleged victim made it sound as if he was forcing himself onto her when the above video shows her groping Cristiano’s arse repeatedly. 

The other piece of ‘evidence’ used by the ‘innocent until accused’ crowd is the use of “no” and “stop”. Firstly, that’s a claim, his signature is nowhere to be seen and the document is about as reputable as me writing down “CR7 raped me after I said ‘no’” on my notepad. 

Not to mention, those words can be used during consensual sex, especially with a sensitive area that is involved in anal. E.g. “No, can we stop for a second” or just through the motions of the act if there is a painful or otherwise uncomfortable moment. 

There was no rape, just a consensual sex encounter that has been taken advantage of for money. This is my belief based on the lack of evidence and inconsistencies in her claim which has put it down to ‘he said vs. she said’. 

My thought process upholds the principle of ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and I will await until the conclusion of the case to brag smugly, if I am correct. 

Not that the court matters, when some of the public either don’t like CR7 and want him to be guilty (heaps of them of r/soccer, especially the Messi fans on various social media) or have an inherent bias for favouring female accusers. </div>

    <div class="md">You just got your first red pill on Reddit.  You are not allowed even to potentially bring up the option that a woman that shouts sexual assault might have actually been consenting to whatever happened in the past.  It's a big no-no everywhere on Reddit.  If you open your eyes you might start noticing more red pills.</div>

    <div class="md">I'm positive you don't have the slightest idea of what misogynist means. Even then if I wrote it, I'm the one who knows exactly what it is supposed to mean. It means exactly what I said. Criticizing people who try to use the rich and famous for a paycheck. 

Please be free to dissect it and find the sexism in there. I showed this to several women and they laughed at it. Not everyone is from the USA where anything with the word 'girl' in it is instantly sexist. You are the reason things like this are happening, you are disrupting the definition of these terms.

Please, do tell me. Then switch the characters in the phrase and think again.

You also don't speak for every single user of /r/soccer so get off your high horse. 'We don't need to tolerate'. Fucking hell.</div>

I'm glad you showed it to women who found it funny? Enjoy your ban</div>

Very convoluted. 

Problem is that many mods choose to not reply with their own username in Mod discussions. Becomes very messy.</div>

    <div class="md">I think the problem is that your comment implies a parallel between your hypothetical situation with this real situation - and as a result of that parallel you imply that this lady who, on the facts provided, was very probably raped by Ronaldo is just lying for fame and money, faking depression and suicidal tendencies in the process.

The 'joke' also implies that any time a girl grinds and dances with a guy, or flirts with a guy, that she consents to being cornered in a bathroom and pressed to give a blowjob, and then subsequently led to a bedroom where she is sodomised because her vagina is being covered as she says "no" and "stop".

You and your friends and girlfriend may see it as laughable, maybe because they know you and your views so can assume it was just a poor taste joke. However, without any context of you as an individual it comes across as you assuming that any woman who accuses a famous person of rape or sexual assault as being a lying attention seeker who is either plain lying, or "changed their mind". It is a damaging view towards women and also generally towards victims of sexual assault. 

You have to appreciate that /r/soccer is a subreddit of over 1 million users with a lot of people jumping to make pretty shocking comments surrounding Ronaldo and there isn't always time in the day to question a user over their personal views and intentions. Maybe a ban is too harsh, but it's like some red cards/VAR in football - if it's given, some can say it's harsh but unlikely to be overturned, if it's not given some will also say that it should've been given but also unlikely to be overturned.

At the end of the day, due to being an anonynous forum, intention is largely irrelevant. So you may not have intended to make a sexist remark, but it certainly comes across as one.</div>
