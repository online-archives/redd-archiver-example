    <div class="md">What the "left" doesnt understand is that what they are trying to do, will absolutely come back around and bite them as well.

We are seeing it now with the twitter pushback, the FB pushback, the firings of Hollywood liberal types etc. For a few years, it was only 1 way, and now it's blowing back at them, just like this will. 

Let the next big public platform be "right" or totally open and watch the left cry foul.

    <div class="md">Some censored comments:

&gt;Very, very naive way of looking at it. Censorship exists in many different ways but having a social media platform ban someone because of their (even fucked up) views is censorship in the worst way. Yes, they have the right to do it, but it doesn't make it right. There's lots of fucked up groups that are allowed to exist and say weird shit, but inforwars is only banned because the left disagrees with it, which is why this is fucked up.
I hate infowars, Alex Jones is a piece of shit, moron, but just because he's wrong and fucked in the head, does not mean he should be censored, he has a right to an opinion and it is the social obligation of these platforms to treat people fairly, which they are not doing.
I know Reddit will downvote this because I'm against the anti-free speech circle jerk and defending Alex Jones, but if you're going to downvote me, at least understand that us disagreeing civilly is the same reason Info Wars is getting removed. Imagine if you weren't allowed to vote or comment simply because some people don't agree with you (which is how I was banned from T_D and /r/politics).
Censorship is a slippery slope, and once it's normal, it's too late.

. 

&gt;I was looking for the things or videos were it could be deemed hateful for YouTube and Facebook standards and couldn’t find it. Just hoping this isn’t a precedent for future bans on other podcasts.

.

&gt;California is the best state in the country, hands down, but its awesomeness isn't enough to contain the insanity caused by heat. Hence, the Central Valley became Florida West.

.

&gt;Infowars.com

&gt;I don't get how what he says is any different from BLM telling people to kill police. Yet one is hated while the other idolized based on nothing more than party lines and who is judging.

.

&gt;He's probably going to sue Apple, Facebook, iTunes, and Google, and the best part is that legally; he's in the right.</div>

    <div class="md">I've been a mod of this sub for months and these are the only two comments I've ever removed. This is a subreddit dedicated to pointing out any and all censorship and ensuring those that aim to spread their beliefs by simply silencing others are not able to do so without being called out specifically. Removing any comments on this sub, to me, should only be done when there is no shadow of doubt that the post(s) is/are in complete violation of both site wide and subreddit wide rules. Removing comments on a sub that is anticensorship could quickly become an act of irony, but I do not believe these removals are censorship at all. 

This comment and the original comment are blatant calls for violence in the form of taking up arms in order to make your beliefs and agenda known. That is not something that I condone and not something that this subreddit will be used to spread. Furthermore, it is in clear violation of well-established rules. 

I understand frustration, but the idea of "they censor us so let's shoot them" is not what this subreddit is about. </div>

That's not what I said and I'll thank you not to put words in my mouth.

I repeat my earlier JFK quote:

"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."

How do you expect this to end but in tears?  If you silence someone, beat them up when they march in protest of their rights being violated, sooner or later words stop being a sufficient response.

It is not a call to violence to recognize that violence is imminent any more than seeing thunderclouds overhead and lightning flashing makes you responsible for the flood of rain and possible lightning strikes if you declare a bad weather warning. 

You mistake the recognition that we are approaching a bad period of time with an eagerness for that time to approach.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  I seriously hope what I expect to see happen does *not* come to pass.  I hope to be **wrong**.  I do not think I will be though.  Take that as you will.</div>
