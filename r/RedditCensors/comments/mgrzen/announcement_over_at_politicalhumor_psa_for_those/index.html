    <div class="md">This would honestly explain all the censorship of comments and content that criticizes corporate centrist dems getting removed for supposedly "not being funny or making an effort at humor" because at least a couple mods are Biden stans and arbitrarily enforce the rules with bias. Turns out liberals are auth pro-censorship and do not find it funny when you poke fun at Biden types or point out the immense double standards/hypocrisy of liberals and liberal MSM.</div>

    <div class="md">Do not link directly to reddit; it can lead to brigading, and if you are trying to show removed comments other users will not be able to view them. Instead, use ceddit.com to link to removed comments/submissions, or archive.is to link to reddit threads (for example, to show a moderator abusing his role). Alternatively you can also post screenshots.

    <div class="md">I put NP (no participation) in the link to discourage brigades and it should cover mods here from reports of brigading. Just a reminder, please do not brigade the thread or even vote in it if you are using the link I've provided. Thank you.

Update: So they did a sort of PR https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/mhn3nc/announcing_a_change_to_rule_6_all_comments_or but don't let the upvotes fool you, it seems to have upset some of the community even further as they would have their comments auto-removed if they forgot to include an approved personal attack, and this was applied to edits to comments that were made before this change, resulting in further comment removals.</div>
