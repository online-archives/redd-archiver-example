    <div class="md">This subreddit is against censorship, but we aren't advocates of calls to violence. I'm pointing out this thread to show how actual rules violations are treated on some subreddits. Myself and many is this subreddit have had posts or comments censored, and bans issued, when no rules were violated at all, simply because the butt hurt mod didn't like what was being said. And usually they pretend you broke a rule, but refuse to be clear about any of it because of course you didn't do anything wrong at all.

But here we have an entire thread of rule breaking, yet no comments are removed. The post isn't removed. The users aren't banned. It's advocating violence, and the mods, despite their hollow sticky at the top and super delayed lock, are complicit.

Break the rules but say something the mods like? Your post gets to stay up and unlocked for a bit. Don't break the rules but say something the mods don't like? Ban, censored. Fuck these mods.</div>

    <div class="md">It's the entire "punch nazi" thing all over again. If you don't agree with them they must be nazis and you can punch them.

I lost so many friends because I was adamant that pouncing someone for speech is wrong and just makes their position stronger. I got called a few choice words because I prefer to talk to people instead of using violence.

This is the new left. Violent and intolerant.</div>

    <div class="md">No I think he's a cunt because as the leader of UKIP, he somehow convinced the majority of the country that by leaving the EU, the UK would close all borders to foreigners and essentially fucked us over then fucked off, when people voted in favour of leaving the EU.

&amp;#x200B;

All politicians are cunts, they tell people what they want to hear to get into power, then go back on their word to further their own agenda.</div>

    <div class="md">Even among fights there are, at least in the USA, degrees of violence. Simple assault is usually a fine with a night in jail and full assault is much worse.
