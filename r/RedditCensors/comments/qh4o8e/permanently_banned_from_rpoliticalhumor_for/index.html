Again, removed with reason given 'Not U.S. Politics.'

&gt;Hi karmagheden. Thank you for participating in /r/PoliticalHumor. However, your submission did not meet the requirements of the community rules and was therefore removed for the following reason(s):
Posts have to be about U.S. Politics (rule #1):

&gt;In other words, if it's not about American politics or elections, we'll remove it pretty quickly.

&gt;Any political ideology is acceptable (that includes conservatives, liberals, libertarians, etc!), but please keep posts civil.

&gt;If you have any specific questions about this removal, please message the moderators. Hateful or vague messages will not receive a response.


I could not write to the mods as If you read my recent post here about that sub, I had been muted from the last time I inquired over a removed post. They don't like when you question their authority and reasoning and they deny bias is involved. So I replied in the thread to the removal message with:

&gt;Really? Still going to claim bias isn't involved with arbitrary removals such as this? How does my post have nothing to do with American politics, exactly? You have two Americans tweeting about American politics, one a ceo who is pro-working class and giving fair wages and the meme points to how the ultra rich (like Jeff Bezos - who is also American) could end hunger but they would rather go to space for 10 minutes. If this isn't in the realm of American politics, then where is that line exactly (a question I asked before to have clarification but it was not answered) and why do I see posts up previously about Bezos going to space if it's 'not American politics because he isn't a politician' just like talking about capitalism in America is also apparently not American politics. Are there any non authoratarian leftists left on the mod team who have any dignity? No? You cool with mods arbitrarily enforcing the rules with bias to remove opinions and users they don't like? I mean you were fine with Don slinging personal attacks at me on multiple occasions and removing a bunch of my stuff in the past that arguably did not violate any rule, so I guess you don't care. I get that most if not all of you do this for free, but there is nothing respectable or admirable about abuse of power.

They responded with:

&gt;It's not US politics.

&gt;It doesn't involve any politicians. It doesn't involve any legislation. It doesn't directly involve anything that is US politics.

&gt;I'm not sure why you think this is a leftist removal. People on the left are far more against billionaires hoarding their wealth instead of paying their fair share of taxes.

&gt;If you don't like how the subreddit is modded, you don't have to participate here.

&gt;And please be civil.

I replied with:

&gt;&gt;It's not US politics.

&gt;I disagree.

&gt;&gt;It doesn't involve any politicians. It doesn't involve any legislation.

&gt;It shouldn't need to involve those things to be related to involve politics in America.

&gt;&gt;It doesn't directly involve anything that is US politics.

&gt;You mean like vague posts on the front of the sub that could literally be about any country, but it has a turning point USA mark on it?

&gt;https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/qgkpdu/not_sure_why_this_is_supposed_to_be_a_bad_thing/

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure why you think this is a leftist removal.

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean. I was doubting a leftist made this removal, but you never know these days with the rise of the auth left/center left.

&gt;&gt;If you don't like how the subreddit is modded, you don't have to participate here.

&gt;If you want people to join your community and keep coming back, you should think about how you treat users who only wish to contribute. You should think about not engaging in selective rule enforcement and overmoderation, especially out of political bias.

&gt;&gt;And please be civil.

&gt;Please be professional and don't abuse your power and suppress debate by removing posts on technicality over bias while others like it stay up because... bias.

Reminder: my post didn't have a 'turning point USA' stamp but it *did* have 'US' in the title.

About 5 hours later, I received this in my inbox:

    <div class="md">&gt;**It was a low effort meme** that wasn't worth all of this.

Is that why they removed it (?) and does it change the fact that their reasoning over the removal is arbitrary? Wasn't worth what? Being banned? Don't worry, I'll find other subs to post funny political stuff to. Or my response? It's been a long time coming. I have a history of them removing posts of mine in the past (vast majority of the time, the reason given: 'did not make an attempt at humor' despite it being upvoted in other leftist communities an even when the community there found it funny and upvoted it) and one mod (who did some of the removing and at least one temp ban) throwing out personal attacks directed at me in the very threads of post of mine which they removed.

You're response is essentially: you picked a shitty hill to die on, and my reply to that is: it's still censorship and mod abuse.  You think they don't use rules like this to remove content and posters or said content, that that do not like? Rules that they don't apply in the same manner to cover content and posters of said content that share their bias and or agenda. Is that not worrisome to you? The quality or opinion of the quality of the meme, is irrelevant when you consider the above. Low effort btw compared to what? Do you see what gets posted and upvoted to that sub on the regular?</div>
