    <div class="md">That is a fair approach where the sub has is dedicated to a purpose you disagree with or the other side of a divide. 
It is finding a single agenda in the subs that you have an interest in and you would like to learn more and test ideas that is frustrating. 
Reddit is fantastic conceptually and I think displaying the number of members v number of bans, comment removals would add the right level of transparency/legitimacy without adding difficulty to administration.</div>

    <div class="md">It is OK if natalists want to talk about why baby making is great and anti natalist want to talk about why life with no babies is great and not have counter arguments to ruin the fun of talking about it exclusively. 
If the censorship level is shown it would help the observer who stumbles into it to see what it is and promote discourse between objective people who want to talk about the pros and cons while still allowing mods to ban shitstirrers.</div>
