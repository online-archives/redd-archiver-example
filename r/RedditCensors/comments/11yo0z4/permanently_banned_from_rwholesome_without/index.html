I cross-posted and AFAIK this isn't against the rules. I posted there 2 hours ago and two more posts nearly 24 hours ago, so 3 within 24 hours. Not sure that constitutes as spam but I don't see any rule against 3 posts a day, some subs only allow 1 and others allow 3 or more per day but they specify. For example both eyebleach and mademesmile allow for up to 4 posts within 24 hours and do not consider that spam. 

At any rate, I have never received so much as a warning on this sub before or a temp ban and I have posted there dozens of times over the course of two years. Now suddenly I receive a permanent ban. If 3 posts is too much in 24 hours, why not just say this and give me a warning? Not sure why a permanent ban is necessary or even appropriate here. I replied to the ban message asking what prompted and warranted a perma ban, no reply back as of yet. 

Tl;dr - I was not aware they consider 3 posts over the course of 24 hours to be spam if that be what brought on the ban (I don't know, there was no note in the ban message) as it doesn't specify in the sidebar what is considered spam to them and at least two other similar subs I would post to don't consider that amont to be spam. Anyways, I was not trying to spam them and the 3 posts in 24 hours was happenstance, not intentional. 

Edit: And I just received a perma ban message from mademesmile 10 minutes ago without explanation. What the hell is going on? I don't post there even 4 times per day (which is allowed) and I post content there that I have seen elsewhere and cross-post (which is also allowed), I have also posted there dozens of times over the last 2 years. I don't post content there that was already posted to that sub to my knowledge and if that is what triggered the ban, it is news to me as I have never so much as received a warning for this.

The last post I made to mademesmile is from 21 hours ago and is still up as of writing this.

These two ^ were posting in a 24 hour period.

https://np.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/11vnwyk/emotional_damage

All still up as of writing this. Not sure what brought on the ban. I replied back to the ban message and no reply back.

Edit: wholesome mod unbanned me with a warning. That was nice of them. The message was basically post less frequently to the sub but also to comment, not just post. Hope to hear back from a mademesmile mod and find out what brought on the ban and if that too can be resolved.

Edit: I heard back from a mademesmile mod. My reply to the ban message + the following convo:

&gt;Wtf? Can I ask what I did to deserve a ban, let alone a permanent ban? I have been posting to the sub for 2 years. I do not post more than 4 posts per day. I cross-post but I don't think that violates the rules. I share from other subs to here but don't knowingly post here content that had already been posted here i.e. reposts, so I am curious why a permanent ban is necessary. Could you allow me to apologize for whatever I did that violated the rules to get the ban lifted or changed to a temp ban? Just seems like an excessive punishment for someone who has posts to your sub so much. If I was doing something wrong, why no dm warning to let me know before? I don't get it.

They replied back:

&gt;you're just spamming reposts everywhere - go find a new sub to farm in

I wrote back:

&gt;??? There is no rule in the sidebar against cross posts and by your definition here those are reposts? Why not just disallow reports so there is no confusion? If you are talking about me posting content to that sub that was already posted to the sub, I was not aware I was doing that and I apologize if that happened but it wasn't intentionally.

&gt;I have posted to your sub for 2 years and never had any issue, not even a warning. But now I am getting this hostility and accused of farming karma and being punished. Every single time I have shared a post to your sub before it was shared from another sub or site and I never heard from mods then. I would wager most if not the vast majority of posts here were shared in the same manner, are you going to tell them they are reposting and just out for karma and ban them as well? Just curious why now is this unacceptable but it wasn't before? It just doesn't make sense and is pretty unfair.

&gt;And I enjoy sharing quality content I come across to appropriate sub so others can see it. If I was just out to 'karma farm,' I wouldn't waste my time posting in subs I expect to get little karma, why would I even bother. Getting karma is a bonus. You are just seeing someone who enjoys posting and again, I cross-posted. I didn't steal content or pretend it is mine and I didn't knowingly post here content that was already posted here. Lastly, there are users with 30 and 40 million karma, so I don't get the prejudice against users with higher karma.

&gt;I would like to get the ban lifted if possible and continue being able to post to mademesmile but that is up to you. I would apologize for any rule I have violated but I didn't do it knowingly or intentionally and as I pointed out above, the repost thing is not very clear.

They replied with:

&gt;We decline to overturn your ban, for the reasons stated above.

I wrote back:

&gt;As per moddiquette, ban appeals should be taken seriously and I made a valid counterargument that what is an isn't reports is NOT clear. What is with the excessive and arbitrary punishment??

They replied twice then muted me for 28 days before I could reply:

&gt;We have considered your ban and your appeal, and have made the decision to keep it in place.

&gt;You're welcome to disagree with our decision, but it will not alter our course.

---------------------------------

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/11yo0z4/permanently_banned_from_rwholesome_without/ seems we're not the only ones that feel this way, either. Outside is nice, or so I hear,.

Guess they didn't read the part where the wholesome mod lifted the ban. What a fair and reasonable moderator. /s</div>

    <div class="md">You always post on this sub about being banned from other subs and it’s always the same story. So again, maybe you’re doing something wrong, maybe your steadfast refusal to really think about and consider what others are telling you is causing you to make the error. 

For example, in these posts you pretty much always add the phrase “without explanation” in the title. But then, the explanation is in your post description. Now you might say that there wasn’t an explanation at the time of posting, but this happens all the time. As in, you’re not learning from your mistake and realising that your explanation will likely come if you’re patient. 

But instead of learning from your mistake, or even admitting you’ve made a mistake, you act all indignant as if everyone other than you is in the wrong. No doubt you carry this attitude all across Reddit and that’s no doubt a driving factor behind you making so many posts about being banned from places. 

Look inward dude.</div>

    <div class="md">The explanation can be put in the ban message and if I don't message them, it never comes. Even when I message them it's a flip of a coin whether I receive a reply and explanation. 

I've shown numerous examples where mods arbitrarily remove posts and ban, when a mods reasoning for a removal or ban is inconsistent and does not add up, when they selectively enforce the rules, when mods engage in excessive and even unwarranted punishment and then act like douchbags when you question a removal or ban try to politely reason with them. 

You always come off as pro censorship, so I don't know what you are doing on this sub. Seems like you just post to discount my experiences of censorship and mod abuse (you don't seem to do this to anyone else here), when I have for a fact experienced it and documented it here multiple times. Anyone doubting this can look through my posts on this sub and also at your replies to some of those posts. They should also be made aware that you and I have a history and you would reply to posts and comments of mine on political subs that I posted to, using ad hominems and fallacious debate and then seemingly follow me here when I posted about a ban from those subs.

    <div class="md">&gt;There’s no quashing of a narrative, you’re not being censored, you’re not being abused. 

I've documented here numerous examples of mod abuse and censorship. 

&gt;People would rather not put up with your bullshit, as is their right.

My bullshit being participating and contributing to subs and wondering why a permanent ban is a fair punishment for unintentionally violating a rule, which in the above cases are not even clear but more specifically when you haven't even violated the rules on the sidebar and mod just bans you because they think you are a bot or karma farmer despite having posted to a number of these subs for years and never having any issue before, not even so much as a warning.

It reminds me of being banned out of nowhere from political subs that I would post to frequently with accusations of spreading misinformation and disinformation. I suspect the issue is a mix of these report trolls and hall monitor types and mods siding with bogus reports out the aforementioned, if not mods themselves buying into mainstream narratives and being for censoring those they disagree with even if these alternative views are based in fact and when it isn't against the rules to disagree with one another. And censorship on Reddit and other social media sites is well documented. Not my imagination, unfortunately.

*Probably based of bogus reports / report abuse by those who want to see users punished and banned for their political bias or maybe they are just hall monitor types and maybe these types get off to seeing those they target get banned and make posts about it in subs like this.

 &gt;There are some excellent examples of censorship posted on this sub, **none of them by you.**

Incredibly dishonest take.

&gt;Try to understand what I’m telling you, you’re the problem not everyone else.

This is projection from someone who downplays and denies censorship when it is directed at someone they don't like.</div>

Seems an awful lot like they consider your “quality content” to be some sort of bullshit and they don’t want to put up with it. I don’t really see how pointing that out is me gaslighting in any way. 

You are certainly free to take your “quality submissions” to other subs, but then you’ll be back here in a months time after being banned from those subs for “no reason” and “without explanation”. But you have to understand that the moderators of those subs are free to ban you if they don’t like your content or your practices, they don’t owe you anything. 

Hell, start your own sub and post whatever you want there, free from the worry of ever getting banned.</div>

I already addressed this flawed and dishonest talking point from you here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditCensors/comments/11kgt65/permanently_banned_from_rautos_without_explanation/jb8s5iu/

Just because a mod removes a post, does not make it a shitty or low quality post. I've had plenty of posts removed despite them being upvoted by the community. And just because a mod considers 1 or 2 posts in a day as 'spam' doesn't make that spam, and at any rate, by their own rules on mademesmile, I did not spam. And as for reposts, I cross-posted and there was no rule against this. Of course if you cross-post or share content from another sub to mademesmile, it is technically a repost and then so isn't the vast majority of the posts there and then they should all be removed and users banned, but usually a repost as I understood by sidebar is if that pic or whatever has already been posted to that sub and if that was even happening at mademesmile on my part, this was not clear to me and I never received a warning. Why if it is such a huge deal would they not just use a bot like other subs do to detect posts that have already been posted there before?

&gt;You are certainly free to take your “quality submissions” to other subs, but then you’ll be back here in a months time after being banned from those subs for “no reason” and “without explanation”. But you have to understand that the moderators of those subs are free to ban you if they don’t like your content or your practices, they don’t owe you anything. 

I don't know why you always defend mod actions when it is me complaining about them. Why is that? You obviously don't care about mods abusing their power or about censorship or at least when someone you don't like or agree with politically is on the receiving end. I have given dozens of examples of overmodedation, poor moderation, outright mod abuse and censorship over my post history to this sub and you turn a blind eye and deny my accounts because you just don't like me and my political views, which you made obvious from our multiple if not numerous interactions on political subs before you seemingly followed me here after I was banned from those subs. Remember accusing me of being a Russian troll spreading Russian and or right wing propaganda? I do. 

I already went over the talking point about being given no explanation. I have to inquire and even then, they don't always give an explanation and often what is given is vague, not clear or does not even add up and I have addressled this and you conveniently ignore that. Yeah, I will just post elsewhere but it's still messed up (but we know you love seeing those you don't like or agree with banned) and I am sure I will still have to deal with hallmonitor types and bad faith reports to get my posts removed and me banned. It's not something you can avoid by just posting elsewhere when people are set on getting your posts removed and you banned. We all know they exist so please don't try to gaslight me or anyone else here about that. If a mod uses excessive punishment or permanently bans me without good reason, I just may post here again, because that is the fucking purpose of this sub. I'm sure you can't wait, but what I find equally sad is people upvoting your pro censorship and mod abuse apologia bullshit. 

 Rule 5 - This sub is open for anyone to participate, but users who do so in bad faith, such as users who themselves engage in or support ideological censorship and then come here to concern troll will not be tolerated.

Iamthemaincharacter? (of course you would accuse me of having a victim complex for pointing out mod abuse and what is likely targeted report abuse). You are straight up disingenuous and antithetical to the mission of this sub.</div>

    <div class="md">So your submissions getting upvoted is proof of their good quality, but my comments being upvoted is proof of some systemic conspiracy against you? 

If you are a loud and disruptive presence in someone’s place of business, they are entitled to ban you from their premises. They don’t have to give you a warning, they don’t have to even give you a reason. Moderators have the same freedom when it comes to their subs. 

It’s bizarre you constantly try to make this something personal about you. Nobody on Reddit knows you personally. All we have to judge you on is the quality of what you submit, which is garbage. Clearly I’m not the only one that points this out to you. 

If you want to keep crying about this without any self reflection then maybe you could save yourself some of this self inflicted “pain” by switching platforms altogether. Facebook is just over there. If you’re having trouble finding it, just follow the stench that smells exactly like what you’re shovelling.</div>

Look, you are not being oppressed. You are not a victim. You are acting like an entitled cry baby and by doing so causing harm to legitimate anti censorship efforts. Get over yourself. 

The dozens upon dozens of posts you make on this sub imply that all the places you’ve been banned from are run by deranged moderators abusing their power for kicks. But in reality if that were truly the case then those subs would die out from all of their user base being banned for “no reason”. But that’s not happening, only you are being banned. Because you are the problem. You are the one that needs to change your practices. 

If anything, your posts are in breach of rule 5.</div>

Seems I struck a nerve there and who is the butt hurt one? You are the one who always replies to my posts here so obviously they get under your skin (not my intent) and obviously you don't care about mod abuse and censorship and this is just something personal because you don't seem to do this with anyone else here and I have documented cases of mod abuse and censorship which you deny over and over because of partisan hackery and or agenda. It's been pretty clear you dont like me because of my political views and posts and want to discredit me, which is why you go out of your way to try and distort and discount my experiences and frame each incident as deserved, reasonable mod action/punishment and simply consequences of my actions when the story and back and forth with mods, say otherwise. 

You are in a sub about censorship and when it comes to me, you give endless apologia to mods and victim blame. It's not just about me, so why do you only seem to do this with me here? I mean it's fucked up to do this to anyone.

I wouldn't be surprised if you were one of the folks reporting my content in those others subs where we had interactions, helping to result in me being banned. At any rate, you're completely dishonest in each post you make here under mine. I've given numerous examples over at least two dozens posts here (and I've never wanted to or tried to be banned from anywhere, these were all from places I would post to) and you've denied I've ever made any valid documentations of mod abuse and censorship and that is so fucking dishonest is isn't funny. If anyone upvoting you took the time to read through my past posts here, they would see that it is YOU who is full of shit. 

Rule 5 is for fakers, be it those who are outright pro censorship or those who are against it until it comes to someone they don't like.</div>

    <div class="md">I know this may seem like a foreign concept to you, but I don’t spend every waking minute of my life on Reddit. I don’t see every single post on every single sub. I don’t even challenge every single piece of bullshitery I see, yours or otherwise. But I do challenge it somewhat regularly. 

If you feel as though you are getting an unequal amount of push back from me, then that’s more of a comment on your output of bullshit more than anything. A claim that can be supported by the amount of false censorship posts you make on this sub, and no doubt to amount of other people challenging your bs in other subs. In fact, I bet you are pulling the same old shit with other people in real time while having your little whinge here. 

You are not a victim of anything here. There’s nothing to be outraged over. You have been banned from subs for what amounts to bad faith engagement, that’s the whole story.

    <div class="md">&gt;The message was basically post less frequently to the sub.

So you were banned for posting too much? That seems counterproductive to why the subreddit exists in the first place. Is it not a place to post?</div>

    <div class="md">I'm not a karma farming bot, but you could be right and I wonder who put that idea into their heads. My guess is bogus reports out hall monitor types but more likely targeted report abuse by those who just want to see a user banned due to their political views and posts.* And mods unfortunately don't have the time or care to talk with the user to see if they are what they're being accused of, they just ban. This is lazy and poor moderation.

*Why would these types also report non political posts, you may ask, because they will report anything and everything they can to get a user punished and shut out from all the main subs the user posts to, l just as punishment. They basically just want you miserable and off the platform. Same types mass report folks on Twitter and or troll them until the person snaps and then they will mass report and get the user banned.  

Anyways, getting back to your initial point, I've been posting to these places over the last 2+ years (and some since I made my account 4 years ago) and sometimes frequently and even when I was posting lots of stuff elsewhere (so like posting a lot in general which I always do and have done) and I was never told then it was not okay. What changed? That is what I'd really like to know but mods have no answer for this and I think it had something to do with targeted report abuse.

And I don't see why a warning or even temporary ban wouldn't have sufficed given the circumstances, If they asked me to post less or not cross-post, I would respect their wishes. Just tell me which rule I supposedly violated, though I guarantee it was not done intentionally, and I will apologize and make an effort not to let it happen again, but instead I am told  there is no chance of getting the ban lifted and told to go outside. 

It's messed up. I enjoyed participating and contributing to these subs. It's not like I wanted to get banned, so there was no ill intent on my part. If it's about reposts, there is obviously confusion there and it is not clear what they consider resposts, is it just any post posted from elsewhere to their sub or content that had already been posted to their sub (which is what I thought the rule was about.) It just was not clear and other subs allow the former but not the latter and that makes sense. If you don't allow either then I guess everyone would need to be OC.</div>
