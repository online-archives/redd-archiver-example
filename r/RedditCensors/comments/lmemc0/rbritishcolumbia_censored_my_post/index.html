Just wanted to highlight here that it was censored. edit: for context, the majority of it focused in BC, and in relating the military in NB I wrote the BC MLA, because the military comes from all over, but the story itself was mostly focused on all forms of institutional sexism I was aware of by some measure.</div>

    <div class="md">I hold free speech in high regard, so will link what I posted below, I stand by my assertions, and i'd love to be demonstratively proven wrong about everything I wrote on institutional sexism, I don't even value my countries own fiat currency and I generally question humanity well I sit here paying little mind to the thousands of titles one could carry on this earth, like the titles don't mean anything if you can't keep your humanity eh, they don't mean anything at all really. Anyhow, my best.
