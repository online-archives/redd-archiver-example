    <div class="md">I don't even know if trump is really to blame. My intuition says no, he was out of office for a long time so even if he did something to cause it it's on the new administration to revert it and if they don't, they're responsible, but I honestly don't care either way.  

But it has nothing to do with Freethought, which was once an atheist sub mainly concerned with debunking outlandish conspiracy theories (9/11, moon landing) or general atheism circlewank.  

you wouldn't know if you looked at its front page, it's indistinguishable from.. all of reddit at this point. Why even have subs any more.  

But a permaban for basically just saying "this shit does not belong", well, I didn't expect that. No free thinking allowed on /r/freethought, don't even question the line or ban.</div>

    <div class="md">The sub clearly states in its about tab the sub is for culture and politics as well. 

Your comment however specifically breaks rule 5.5. 

You add nothing substantial to the post besides I don't like X because of Y. Do you have facts or reasoning to back up your opinion? No. You state even hear its just an intuition or guy feeling. Real lib shit right there. "I know the facts say one thing but my feelings say another so I'm going to ignore all the evidence and just go with what makes my baby brain happy."</div>
