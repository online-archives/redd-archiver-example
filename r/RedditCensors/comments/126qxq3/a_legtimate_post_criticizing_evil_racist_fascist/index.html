    <div class="md">My wife is Chinese. It’s a not-uncommon prescription in a number of traditional Chinese medications and medical treatments. She would never eat dog under any circumstances, but relatives in the old country still do on occasion.

If this number is true, it is a statement of fact. What makes it “objectionable” is how it manipulates western values of pet ownership and animal welfare into demonizing the Chinese practices and the Chinese culture.

As the old Chinese saying goes, “anything that exposes its back to the sky is meant to be eaten.” -- which doesn’t include humans because under normal daily conditions our backs are vertical, not horizontal.

After all, what _is_ the difference between a dog and a pig in terms of the edibility of its flesh? As Westerners, we just treat one much better than the other out of convention, historical preferences, and social pressure, but this can also be used to weaponize our perception of other cultures against them.

And _that_ is where the problem lies. Not the facts, but the weaponization of cultural mores to unfairly malign out-groups.</div>

    <div class="md">Reddit is strange.  Someone, somewhere will determine if something is offensive, and then the whole site appears to magically takes on that stance overnight.

It reminds me of a while back on a thread like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/n6sz3e/orange_cat_in_a_wok_dont_worry_just_a_joke/) where making a comment like "mmm crispy orange korean chicken", and it's hilarious until a few days later some snowflake comes barging in like ZOMG RAYCIST, vote-bots it, and it's now worthy of a site-ban.  I'm like... dude that's not even close to being racist...AND if you even understood what racial mix I was, you would realize how dumb you were for saying that.  Claiming to be offended by self-deprecating humor is like complaining you have to wash your own face because someone else pied themselves.

It's like you mentioned your wife is Chinese, and lambasting the typical mainland chinese tourists for being entitled snotty obnoxious cunts, or the chinese cheat-farms infesting online games does not mean you're racist to chinese people.

This site has a nasty combination of outrage+stupid.</div>

    <div class="md">I hate the ccp as much as the next guy, but this is an arbitrary culture hate.  Pigs are smarter then dogs. Dog is simply normalized there and not here and you are acting judgmental for it. It’s simple minded to think it’s more immoral to eat a dog then a pig because you find them cuter.</div>

    <div class="md">This argument is horrifying. “What is the difference between human meat and pigs?” Could be said by a cannibal , and would be understood by a westerner as insane.

    <div class="md">I don’t mean to hurt your feelings but I didn’t necessarily care what you appreciated or not at the time of my first comment, and technically it’s true. You actually happened to not disagree with my point. I mean, would the post been removed had it been relating to some European peoples who partake in eating horse meat ceremoniously? [It’s commonly known](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_meat), I’m not against it, and that’s a whole other issue in it’s entirety really. But anyway mentioning the European culture in my original comment helped  me make my point. Again, a point you don’t disagee with. Are you suggesting that, because of my nationality and citizenship, im not allowed to utter the word European or something? cmon my man</div>
