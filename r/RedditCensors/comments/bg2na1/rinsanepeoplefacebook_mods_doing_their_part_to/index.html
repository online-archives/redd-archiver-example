    <div class="md">There are so many fantastic comments that the mods didn't want you to see. Here's a good one:

&gt;So no discussion to be had about the extremism that may or may not be brought by these people? That's insane. It's downright dangerous to disregard any argument against a set of values and ideas as "racist" and just ban/remove said arguments. It's exactly the type of intolerance and discrimination you claim to be against. It's an insult to freedom of speech and to the very goal of this website and the internet. Check yourselves, please!</div>

    <div class="md">So weird, people can't choose to be black, asain, white or whatever. People can choose there religion, and when parts of their religion has terrible aspects, that are viewed by a large amount of the people following the religion, they deserved to be criticized. Like I've completely missed when muslims became something nobody can criticize in the media- i swear it wasn't too long ago people were talking shit on how sexist muslim countries are and what not.</div>
