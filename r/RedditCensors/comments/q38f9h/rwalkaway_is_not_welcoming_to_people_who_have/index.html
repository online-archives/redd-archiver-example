But seriously, you're in a subreddit about Reddit censorship. If you're not going to preview what was censored (and optionally, though probably preferable, its context), and only show us your ban message, then this post was better off in /r/banned.</div>

    <div class="md">I agree, but it doesn't automatically make a child drag star the subject of abuse. There are different aspects of any hobby/entertainment. 

For example: I'm a busker (not for a living). People think I beg for money. I actually am providing a quick entertainment and you can donate to show support if you want. There are people who are begging who call themselves buskers. They of course give busking a bad name. 

There are abuses that happen in child pageantry, but that's the exception not the rule. I see nothing wrong with child drag, but agree abuse like any other child pageantry could happen. Drag culture loves pageantry of any kind. Anything that is ridiculous to normal people (outside of the pageant event) is ripe for the picking in drag culture. Dog shows, equine, 4H, county fair, and sure child beauty are looked at for what next ridiculous thing can be spoofed for laughs (often intertwined with sex humor).</div>

    <div class="md">No, honestly I don't agree with the hate the bulk of the sub slings at the people they pretend to be set up to welcome. The fact that I was banned means that it is by design and not a welcoming community. 

I know there are welcoming conservatives out there, but that community seems to want to troll themselves out of explaining their individual points of view.</div>

    <div class="md">My apologies for going a bit overboard with this, but, at least to me, [your history in the walkaway subreddit doesn't even seem to be that bad nor antagonizing for the most part](https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/#%7B%22author%22:%22CptHammer_%22,%22subreddit%22:%22walkaway%22,%22resultSize%22:100%7D), minus that one time you were arguing with someone (who happens to be tagged with `I'm brainwashed`, and flairs such as those are probably assigned by the mods, so it looks like that person was a bad actor or someone that didn't align with Walkaway and was just looking for a fight) about something Patton Oswald said.

As for this particular ban itself, I agree that it was not a fair ban. But I don't exactly see how your negative sentiment of said community lines up with your written history in said same community.</div>
