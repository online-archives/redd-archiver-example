      <div class="md">No sense in linking individual threads or comment chains, as it's quite easily searchable at this point.

Most of the default subreddits have a very biased political leaning (especially toward anything not male/female sex, and the sex-change groups), where they would not hesitate to frame all these shooters as unhinged right-wing voters, and jump on the gun politics that relate to it.   This recent one, they discovered it was an individual who had a sex-change, and that is something that most default subs have a strong political bias toward protecting, and marginalizing any related issues (especially the topic of mental illness).  They discovered that they couldn't generalize the shooter by politics, and yet, can't make political affiliation the scapegoat - thus they contradict themselves.  Cognitive dissonance comes into play as those who preach against bigotry are also guilty of using it to further their own politics.  

It is interesting to see how a real discussion would play out on the issue, but most of these subreddits are censoring any talk addressing this issue, as it makes everybody look bad, and nobody wants to admit that all sides of the political isle have rotten eggs, and hopes to ignore, and bury it.

    <div class="md">I believe the admins are involved in that culture to some degree, as they have had several incidents relating to such in the past with admins, and mods exhibiting poor behavior.  I'm not entirely sure what to call the group as anything specific seems to be a "slur" according to mods/admins who will not hesitate to ban immediately, but maybe they just do it to anybody who isn't on their team or cheerleading for them.

I feel as though I'm walking on eggshells just addressing the issue now, as that group which has clout with the admins is very spiteful, and  trigger-happy with the ban-hammer.  Even the hint of some snarkiness or hyperbole about the issue in other subs will be "breaking a rule" - earning a non-negotiable ban, but then the thread is filled with childish cursing and name-calling, which is apparently okay if they're defending the mods/admin's political views.

    <div class="md">I think the conversation is always going to have a biased outlook depending on whose doing the speaking. For example that wasn't even the only mass shooting at an elementary school THAT DAY.

As far as the politics of the recent shooter it's understood they didn't have any serious political beliefs or political activity. You may say being Trans is political in it of itself. To that I would say most Trans people are just trying to exist and are about as interested in politics as the average person. 

Compare that to many of the past shooters, a great number who openly posted about right wing politics even purchasing memorabilia from certain right wing representatives and organizations. 

The reality is since 2018 there's been over 2,000 mass shootings in the USA and 3 of them have been conducted by Trans identifying citizens. 

That being said other countries have white men, they have mental instability, they have right wing politics and they have Trans people. So what is different here? What is happening here that is different from every other country? That's the only topic that should be discussed.

The topic being right wing politics or Trans youth for example are a joint effort by the media, the state department, our politicians, and the weapons manufacturers who pay them all off to distract people from the real issue and keep lining their pockets.</div>

    <div class="md">I find it disgusting some people are using children as pawns for sex-politics.  They want to proselytize to them (with borderline non-age-appropriate sexual material in schools) like many religions do, and cue the namecalling, and censorship if you insist on sensible discretion.  It's such a dissonant stance, as the left tends to be the sympathetic one to bettering our educational system.

Every person I know, democrat, or republican voter outside of these online forums agree that discretion is necessary.  This site is definitely getting to some communist China levels of silencing people.</div>

    <div class="md">I think a lot the misunderstanding comes from what people think being lgbtq+ is. Their entire lives aren't sexual. Like do you walk around constantly thinking and talking about sex? Because you shouldn't be around children no matter your sexual orientation if that's the case. 

As far as the grooming goes let me ask you a question, did all of the years and years of only straight people being in the media stop people from being gay and Trans? If not, then why would a few gay and Trans people being in books and tv/movies make straight kids gay? The cognitive dissonance you have to engage in to think this way is why it's so easy for the media to decide what you'll be upset about next.</div>

    <div class="md">The only difference to contrast is who they have sex with (anything but M/F...?), so you shouldn't be surprised when that's the focus when people talk about it.

"Grooming" seems like a strong word, and implies stuff like preparing someone to be sexually assaulted.. no idea why people are referring to it as that.  Still, pushing such material on children is inappropriate.  If they really want to know, they can search themselves, but keep it out of the curriculum.  Math, science, history, but not politically motivated sex ideologies... facts about the bird and the bees should be as far as it goes, as at the very least, prevent unplanned pregnancies.  If they decide they want to irreversibly mutilate their body, they should be at least 18 and not expect taxpayers to assist.

As for stuff like TV and movies, things should flow naturally.   I noticed more frequently they will force a minority (sex, skin color, etc.) into the plot that clashes as an afterthought, as if to only get people to bicker about how bad the show was, and how bad of a person someone is for not liking it (making it about how a norwegian character was black or bi or something).  

TBF, I don't care for seeing hetro people snogging in every single movie either, and it rarely adds anything significant to the plot, but hey, if someone can see 2 seconds of scarlett johansson's titty, it will boost ratings for an otherwise boring show... but I'm free to turn that off without a small hostile group calling me a xxxx-phobia/phobic bigot for giving it the stink-eye.  I know it's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting that people with different interests existing doesn't mean you have to like them, or give them anything.  You don't see golfers calling basketball fans PGAtour-phobic bigots, do you?</div>

    <div class="md">That's all people talk about but that's a very very small portion of their lives. Lgbtq members aren't going around all day trying to sleep with everyone they come across. They go to work, cook, clean, engage in hobbies and are active in their communities like everyone else. It's reductive to only consider them by their sexual orientation. Furthermore, as you just said the ONLY difference is who they kiss at home, so why care?

I brought up grooming because you used the phrase proselytize which implies the same thing. They are being conditioned or convinced into being gay or trans. 

As far as the education goes, I'd say 100 years ago to teach basic sex education(ie the birds and the bees) or pregnancy prevention would be abhorrent in public schools. Parents would be enraged and pull their kids out, threaten teachers and school board members, burn and ban books they were scared of their children reading. However, today we know better right? Now we know that as our society and understanding of human culture evolves so does our education systems. 

Also who is making it political? The kids who are just learning about it and have no idea about politics? The lgbtq+ community who isn't looking for power or even equality but rather just representation? Is the political aspect coming from the people trying to convince you these people are both weak and scary? That they are coming for your kids and trying to bring down society around you when in reality they don't give a shit about you or your kids. 

As far as representation goes in the media it's hard to understand how important it is when you're the one who is always represented. When they take a Norwegian character and make him black, that same level of frustration or aggravation you feel as an adult; some little black boy sees that and feels the same level of pride, hope. If as a grown man you can't handle a miniscule level of frustration that could fundamentally change a child's perspective for the better than you're just not a good human being. What a small part of your life to get upset about when it could be major to a child. Everything we do should be for future generations and this is a sacrifice you can make without actually losing anything. 

Btw there were a large number of North Africans as far as Norway even before the Reign of the vikings. The idea that none of their stories or legends had black/brown people in them is fundamentally incorrect.</div>

    <div class="md">What about when they want to change the channel away from straight people? When they don't want to see straight couples in movies and shows and magazines and kids books/TV?

They can't. It's not reality. They would have to create their own entire little world to live in. You're asking for the same, "I don't like reality get it out of my face." How about you grow up and get over it, not everything is about you.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't care to see "straight" people over-sexualize as a non-plot portion of a show just for the sake of ratings, either. Difference is, that's 99.9% of people, and there isn't a team of SJWs ready to berate me, or crusade online forums when I say ew/nasty, and "change the channel".

I don't demand the world to learn, or even care about any abnormal hobbies or activity I do, and neither should anyone else. Everyone needs to mind their own business. Even the religious nuts don't go that far, as the most they usually do is silently judge you for not believing in their sky fairy. When people don't mind their own business, they shouldn't be surprised when they get an even bigger boot out the door.

Lastly, "grow up" isn't an argument to civilized discussion, it only shows that you are incapable of articulating your thoughts, so insulting others is all you have left.</div>

    <div class="md">Okay well lgbtq+ people are more than 7% of the country. That's well over 2 million Amercans alone. You can't just act like an entire portion of the population doesn't exist to make yourself feel better.

I don't know what little world you live in but apparently it's one where everyone else should create a bubble around you and only allow what you want in. A safe space if you will. 

Also great point, mind your business. If you're not lgbtq+ and you don't like to engage with that sort of thing then why even worry about it? It's such a small portion of the population, right? Then why obsess over it? Why do you think Fox News and all the alternative news networks are all focused in on lgbtq+ people?

    <div class="md">The definition will never change, and thats why you are now learning Terrorism's definition here.   You know it as well as the rest of us now if you didn't know it 30 minutes ago, *the use or threat of violence especially against the  public as a politically motivated means of  coercion* is the topic of today.  A terrorist started this discussion among many around the nation with their act of politically motivated violence against children.

This is the point of terrorism.</div>

    <div class="md">If you feel frightened by the dictionary, thats a you issue.    You can't change a definition by projecting your issues onto others.

I hope you get your answers and find a way to quell your fears you brought up.  It sounds your fear is affecting your ability to reason right now, so I truly do hope you can.  Especially if you're harboring unmentioned thoughts that drove you to subtly try and deny the definition of terrorism.  If the dictionary hits too close to home for your comfort, maybe it's a good inflection point.  Good luck.</div>

    <div class="md">I don't write all of the dictionaries that offend you into becoming the  interpersonal drama seeking insult prone person you are right now.  That's you, being yourself, and upsetting yourself.

Good luck becoming a better person.  I hope you can find a way; and I forgive you for your aggression.  Fears make people do bad things.  You'll be good some day.  You won't have those fears you keep mentioning some day.  Be well.  Do well.  Don't take action prompted by the aggression you are displaying.</div>

    <div class="md">You're right, you don't. You don't even understand the definitions you use. You might be the most illiterate person I've encountered on this sub. No only do you copy and paste entries from the dictionary without reading them you also reply to comments without reading them. At least I'm assuming so because the amount of cognitive dissonance it would take to engage in a conversation that way would require your brain to be literal sludge. 

I don't have hope for you becoming a better person. The hate you display is proven to come from fear. Fear is proven to come from a lack of understanding.  The only way to learn is to read and you've proven thats not an ability you posses. While I rehabilitation over incarceration is a core belief of mine, I also belive some people aren't worth the time. You would be in that category. Even if someone were to sit down with you and teach you letters and then words and eventually sentences I don't know if you would ever make it to the point of being able to both read and comprehend entire paragraphs at a time. Part of me is sorry for you but a larger part of me is just relieved your terminally online so no one will ever hear the hate you spew from the amalgamation you might refer to as your facial orfice.</div>

    <div class="md">I absolutely agree with you.  This time, it is used literally by the dictionary.   We need to continue to use it exactly as defined, rather than how Congress has been throwing it around for anything they don't like, similarly to how they use "fascism" for anything they don't like rather than as another word for corporatism as defined by the political party's creator.

It's only a matter of time before corporatists receiving government money to censor on behalf of political agendas start censoring the dictionary, but right now the actual definition is not being censored just denied.</div>

    <div class="md">Actually no, thats not at all what fascism's creator defined it as.  Fascism's inventor defined it in the fewest simplest way as corporatism because its a merger of corporate and state powers.   He used those powers to have media suppress his opponents so they had no voice, and to spread propaganda so people would hate who they were told to hate on command.  Whenever you hear "It's a private corporation it can do anything it wants" while its working against you on behalf of the government, look for reasons they might be working for political parties, like the payments Musk proved on twitter.  That proved fascism is happening in American government right now with zero room for denial.

Definitely don't just go throwing it around derisively or think it means anything you don't like, or any kind of authoritarian regime.  Know what it means and how it has come to America waving flags just as predicted.

Fascism was easy to implement considering media is only owned by a half dozen or so interests.  We likely have fascists fighting fascists to control whose propaganda is heard loudest right now, but for now the proof of fascism is rather one sided as only one media corporation's CEO was willing to go public to confirm political payments for meddling have been standard practice.</div>

No snark intended and I forgive you for whatever it is that has prompted your aggressive confrontation seeking response.

I'm sorry for the part I played in this outburst, and I hope whatever it was is gone soon and you feel better quickly.  You don't deserve whatever it was that made you feel this way.   Be well!</div>
